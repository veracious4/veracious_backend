 Published: 2007-08-13 21:55:00 Updated: 2007-09-06 09:40:17  Posted: August 13, 2007Updated: September 6, 2007 Question:Can bloat be attributed to feeding your dog ice or ice water?A:Â  Not directly.
 If your dog drinks the ice water or eats the ice cubes too fast, there is a potential to lead to bloat.Bloat is a condition in a dog or cat when they eat too much or too fast, and suck in air with the food or water, allowing the stomach to fill with gas.
 Most often, dogs will eat their meal very fast and then run or play, sucking in air as they bounce around, filling their stomach.
 Some dogs will bloat by eating too much too fast.
 Regardless, the stomach fills with gas and is at risk for flipping, causing a GDV (Gastric Dilatation and Volvulus), which is an emergency condition and required immediate surgery.
 Dogs with bloat or a GDV can very quickly go into shock and if stretched too far can potentially slough part of their stomach, which is life threatening.Most common breeds susceptible to bloat are the deep chested dogs, like Bassett Hounds, Standard Poodles, Labradors, Weimaraner, Shepherds, etc.Signs of bloat include:Trying to vomiting without producing anything (gagging)Inability to get comfortable and lie downRestlessnessDistended, firm abdomenInappetanceIf your dog shows any of these clinical signs, I would recommend taking your dog to a veterinarian immediately.~Dr.
