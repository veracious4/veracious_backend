 Synthetic cannabinoids are part of a group of drugs called new psychoactive substances (NPS).
 NPS are unregulated mind-altering substances that have become newly available on the market and are intended to produce the same effects as illegal drugs.
 Some of these substances may have been around for years but have reentered the market in altered chemical forms, or due to renewed popularity.
 Individuals reported acquiring the contaminated synthetic cannabinoid products (i.e., K2, spice, synthetic marijuana, and legal weed) from convenience stores, dealers, and friends, in counties across the state.
 Cases of adverse reactions associated with illicit drug use are not required to be reported to IDPH.
 After IDPH determined that the cause of the severe bleeding outbreak was linked to synthetic cannabinoid product use, the outbreak investigation concluded at the end of May.
 Although there may be future cases, IDPH will not report numbers.
 Individuals who are unable to stop using synthetic cannabinoids can locate a substance use disorder provider or treatment facility through the Illinois Helpline for Opioids and Other Substances at helplineIL.org.
 If you have used any of these products, and start experiencing severe, unexplained bleeding or bruising, please have someone take you to the hospital immediately or call 911.
 Do not walk or drive yourself.
 Tell your health care providers about the possible link between your symptoms and synthetic cannabinoid use.
 As of May 30, 2018, IDPH had received reports of 164 cases in 15 counties in Illinois linked to an outbreak that began March 7, 2018.
 County Number of Cases Chicago 40 Cook County 10 DuPage County 2 Fulton County 2 Kane County 1 Kankakee County 2 McLean County 1 Madison County 1 Mason County 2 Peoria County 35 Stark County 1 Stephenson County 1 Tazewell County 49 Will County 1 Winnebago County 9 Woodford County 7 Total 164 Cases by Age Group Number of Cases 15-24 30 25-34 64 35-44 38 45-54 21 55+ 11 Total 164 _______________________________________________ About Synthetic Cannabinoids Synthetic cannabinoids are human-made, mind-altering chemicals that are either sprayed on dried, shredded plant material so they can be smoked or sold as liquids to be vaporized and inhaled in e-cigarettes and other devices.
 They are sold for recreational drug use with claims they will provide the user the effects of cannabis.
 These products are also known as herbal or liquid incense and have brand names such as K2, Spice, Black Mamba, Bombay Blue, Genie, and Zohai, but may be packaged under other brand names also.
 These chemicals are called cannabinoids because they are similar to chemicals found in the marijuana plant.
 Because of this similarity, synthetic cannabinoids are sometimes misleadingly called "synthetic marijuana" (or "fake weed"), and they are often marketed as safe, legal alternatives to that drug.
 In fact, they are not safe and may affect the brain much more powerfully than marijuana; their actual effects can be unpredictable and, in some cases, more dangerous or even life-threatening.
