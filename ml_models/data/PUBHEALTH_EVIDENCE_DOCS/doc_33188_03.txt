risk for suicide by youth

3. Kates and Mauser  (pp. 658

660, 671) provide a distorted review of the literature
 
on the effect of 
concealed carry laws in the United States.  A more complete and accurate description can be found as 

conclusions from some two dozen p
ublished studies.

The Kates and Mauser claims about firearms in 
English

Ther
e are many other aspects of the paper which are problematic; here are three:
 
 
6. Kates and Mauser see the world 
as 
a dichotomous 
one 
filled with
 
only bad 
guys and 
good
 
guys
, 
criminals and decent
-
law
-
abiding citizens
.
  
The criminals are very bad, and the go
od guys are always 
good.  In their world they seem to believe the bad guys can always get guns, and the good guys will 
always use guns appropriately.  
The policy conclusions are clear.  I
n a more realistic model, there is a 
continuum of people with good an
d bad behavior, 
and how they behave depends on their disposition 
that day (e.g., are they tired, drunk, afraid) and the situation.  In the latter model, the effects of various 
policies become an empirical question.
 
 
7. 
Kates and Mauser are often confusing 
because they are talking about homicide, and then they 


 

 
(e.g., 653)
.
  
But
 
most violent crimes have little to do 
with guns.  Guns primarily make hostile interactions much more lethal.
 
 
8. While Kates and Mau
ser often cite 

mo
re
 
interesting findings (e.g., 
three quarters of felons who fire guns in criminal situations claim to have 
had no prior intention of doing so, and about half who fire guns wh
ile committing crimes claim to have 
done so in self
-
defense) (Wright, Rossi & Daly 2003). 
 
 
 
 
 
 Too many 
of the other claims by Kates and Mauser 
are also misleading; most 
of the issues 
are discussed 
in 
Private Guns and Public Health
, which tries to d
iscuss 
all the relevant
 
scientific 
literature
, rather than 
just one side 
for 
some debate.
  
The Kates and Mauser article is simply a 
one
-
sided 
polemic, usually 
misleading, and does not deserve much 
attention
.
