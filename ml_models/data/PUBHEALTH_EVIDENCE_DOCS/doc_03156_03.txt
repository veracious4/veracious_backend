Why We Did This 
Project
 
 
We conducted this audit to 
deter
mine whether 
the 
air 
quality monitoring and related 
activities 
conducted 
in the 
greater Houston area 
by 
the
 
U.S
.
 
Environmental Protection 
Agency 
(
EPA
)
 
and the state of 
Texas
:
 
 
 

 
A
ddressed potential 
high

O
n August 25, 2017
, 
Hurricane 
Harvey made landfall on the 
U.S. 
Gulf Coast
 
as a 
C
ategory
 
4 storm.
 
Many of t
he
 
Houston area

air monitor
s 
were
 
shut down 
and secured
 
prior to 

landfall 
to 
prevent damage
.
 
T
he EPA and 
state and 
local agencies 
subsequently 
conducted 
mobile 
monitoring
 
to assess air quality 
conditions
, 
including 
the levels 
of 
hazardous air pollutants
, 
which are 
also called 
air toxics
.

EPA Needs to Improve Its 
Emergency Planning 
to Better Address Air Quality Concerns 
During
 
Future 
Disasters
 
 
 
 
What We Found
 
 
Most 
air toxic 
emission
 
incidents
 
during 
Hurricane Harvey 
occu
r
red 
within 
a 5
-
day 
period 
of 
th
e storm

 
landfall. 
The major
i
ty 
of t
hese 
emissions 
were 
due to industrial 
facilities shutting down and restarting 
operations in response to the storm
 
and 
storage tank failures
.
 
However, 
state
, 
local
 
and 
EPA 
mobile 
air monitoring 
activities 
were 
not 
initia
ted 
in time 
to 
assess the impact 
of the
se
 
emissions
. 
Additionally, o
nce started
, 
monitoring effort
s
 
did not always 
generate data 
considered 
suitable
 
for making health
-
based
 
assessments
, 
in part 
because there 
was 
no 
guidance 
outlining how 
to 
monitor 
air qua
lity 
following
 
an emergency. 
 
 
The 
air 
monitoring data 
collected 
did not indicate 
that 
the levels of 
individual
 
air 
toxic
s
 
after Hurricane Harvey 
exceed
ed
 
the 
health
-
bas
ed 
threshold
s
 
established 
by the state of Texas 
and 
the EPA
. However, 
the
se
 
thresholds 
do not 
consider 
the cumulative impact of 
expos
ure 
to multiple 
air 
pollutants
 
at one time.
 
Further
,
 
the 

thresholds 
are based on short
-
term exposure 
to a single
 
air
 
pollutant 
and do not consider lifetime exposures. 
Consequently, 
t
he 
thresholds 
may
 
not 
be 
sufficiently protective 
of residents in 
communities 
that 
neighbor industrial facilities
 
and experience repeated or ongoing exposures
 
to 
air 
toxics
. 
 
 
We did not 
identify instances of inaccurate communicat
ion
 
from the EPA 
to the 
public
 
regarding air qual
ity after Hurricane Harvey. However, 
public 
communication 
of 
air monitoring results 
was limited
.
 
A
s a result, communities 
were unaware 
of
 
the 
a

.
 
T
his lack of 
awareness
 
can 
diminish public trust
 
and confidence
 
i
n the EPA
.
 
 
 
 
Recommend
ations
 
and Planned 
Agency 
Corrective Actions
 
 
We recommend that 
the 
Assistant
 
Administrator for 
Land and
 
Emergency 
Management 
develop 
guidance 
for 
emergency
 
air monitoring 
in heavily 
industrialized areas
,
 
develop a plan 
to 
provide pub
lic access to 
air monitoring 
data
,
 
and 
assess the 
availability and use of remote and portable monitoring 
methods.
 
We also recommend that 
the 
Region
 
6 Regional 
Administrator 
develop 
a plan to 
inform communities near 
industrial areas
 
of adverse health risks
 
and to
 
limit exposure to air toxics in these communities
,
 
and conduct environmental 
justice 
training
. We 
further 
recommend that 
the Associate Administrator for Public 
Affairs 
establish a 
process 
to 
communicate
 
the resolution of public concerns
.
 
Two
 
of 
our
 
six 
recommendations
 
are 
resolved with corrective actions pending
. 
The remaining 
four 
recommendations
, which we revised after we issued our draft 
report,
 
are unresolved
 
pending receipt of corrective action plan
s
 
from the EPA

Introduction 
 
 
Purpose 
 
 
The Office of Inspector General (OIG) for 
the 
U.S. 
Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA
) 
conducted this audit to determine 


(1
)
 
addressed potential high
-
risk areas, (2) indicated any potential heal
th 
concerns, and (3) were accurately
 
communicated to the public with respect to 
monitoring results and potential health concerns.
 
 
Background 
 
 
O
n August 25, 2017
, 
Hurricane Harvey made landfall on the 
U.S. 
Gulf Coast as a 
C
ategory 4 storm, dropping over 
19 trillion gallons of 
rain across th
e region
 
(Figure 1)
. 
During this unprecedented weather event, t
he highest total rainfall in 


60.58 inches

was recorded near 
Nederland
, Texas, about 
90 miles east of Hou
ston. According to state officials, more than 270,000 homes 
were imp
acted, with 
approximately
 
80,000 homes 
inundated 
with at least 
18
 
inches of water. 
Hurricane 
Harvey 
was 
the most expensive natural disaster in 
more than a decade
 
and the second costliest in U.S.
 
history
, causing an estimated 
$125 billion in damage.

According to the 
United States 
Global Research Program

en
t climate 
assessment
,
1
 

heavy precipitation events in most 
parts of the United States have 
increased in both intensity and 
frequency since 1901 and are projected to continue 
to increase over this century
.

storms, including hurricanes, have increased by 6% to 7%
, on average, compared 
to what they would have been a century ag

 
Similarly, 
a
 
study 
published in the 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
 
of the United States of America
 
indicates that the annual probability of rainfall in excess of 
19 inches
 
has 
increased sixfold since the late 20th century.
2
 
Thus, t
he 
likelihood that 
the 
EPA, 
states and local governments 
will 
have to 
continue to 
respond to 
disasters 
similar 
to 
Hurri
c
ane 
Harvey 
has also increased
.
 
 
Air Quality Impacts of Hurricane 
Harvey
 
 
Bef
ore 
Hurricane Harvey ma
de
 
landfall, many industrial sources 
of air pollution

such as oil and gas production facilities

shut down their operations in anticipation 
of heavy rainfall and flooding. 
When industrial facilities shut
 
down or restart the
ir 
plant op
erations
,
 
significant spikes in 
air 
pollutants

including hazardous air 
pollutants
,
 
which are 
also referred to as 
air toxics

can result
. These 
spikes 
are 
often referred to as startup, shutdown, malfunction (SSM) emissions. 
 
 
M
any 
industrial 
facilities 
affec
ted by 
Hurricane Harvey
 
were forced to 
ma
ke
 
last
-
minute decision
s regarding whether to shut down
 
because of 
the 
uncertain 
course 
of the storm
. 
Facili

which is located

of 
Houston, 

path and were able to 
coordinate 
shutdown activities early, thus 
reducing
 
SSM 
emissions. However, the 
hurricane

course 
toward
 
Houston 
was not as 
clear
.
 
W
hen 
the storm 
did make landfall
,
 
it 
sta
ll
ed over 
southeastern Texas
, leading to massive flooding. 
Man
y facilities
 
in 
Houston
, therefore, 
were shutting down within 24 hours of when the 
heavy 
rainfall began
. 
After the storm passed and flooding subsid
ed, 
all the 
facilities 
that 
shut down 
resumed 
normal operations. 
 
 
According to excess emission
s
 
reports volu
ntarily
 
submitted to 
the 
Texas 
Commission on Environmental Quality
 
(
TCEQ
)
 
by impacted facilities
 
in Harris 
and Jefferson 
c
ounties
, Hurricane Harvey resulted in industrial facilities releasing 
an extra 
340
 
tons of 
air toxics
.

These emissions were from acci
dents, facility

T

suspended during 
and for 7 months after 
Hurricane Harvey.
 
Thus, the total emissions reported likely und
errepresent 
the total excess emissions due to Hurricane Harvey. For example, only 13 of 
nearly 4
00 majo
r industrial facilities 
operating in Harris and Jefferson counties reported excess emissions due to facility shutdowns or startups during 
the 
hurricane
. 
Of these 13 facilities, six reported only emissions related to a shutdown event.

shutdowns 
during
 
the hurricane and facility startups after the hurricane. For 
example
:
 
 

 
A
 
gasoline spill at 
Magel
lan in the Galena Park Terminal released an 
estimated 282
 
tons of 
combined 
air toxics
, including over 
6 
tons of benzene
. 
 

 
A
 
flo
ating roof tank failure at Valero 
released 
an estimated 12.5
 
tons of 
combined 
air toxics
.
 

 
During a startup
 
event
, the Flint Hills Resources Port Arthur Facility 
released 0.89 tons of air toxics. 
 

 
During a shutdown
 
event
, the ExxonMobil Beaumont Refinery re
leased 
0.07
 
tons of air toxics.

ed
 
community members and health officials. 
Short

such as 
benzene can cause drowsiness

headaches
;
 
irritation to eyes
;
 
skin and respiratory tract

ms
;
 
and, 
at very high levels, unconsciousness and death. 
In addition
, r
esidents 
who

e
 
near 
Houston
-
area industrial 
facilities already experience chronic exposure to 
high levels of air pollution
. 
 
 
Health 
Impacts
 
in Fenceline Communities
 
 
A
ccording to a 
study published in 
Environmental Science 
and
 
Technology
, the 
health impacts of direct and indirect particulate matter emissions from SSM 
events in Texas 
were 
estimated to cost $148 million in 2015.

An analysis of air 
pollution risks in the greater Houston
 
area conducted for the 
Houston 

Task Force on 
t
he 
Health Effects of Air Pollution 
reached the following 
conclusion
:
 
 
East Houston neighborhoods that face a number of vulnerabilities 
based on their marginal social and economic standing also carry a 
heavier burden of health risks from breathing pollutant
s in their air. 
They tend to be located closer to major point sources than most 
other neighborhoods in the 
G
reater Houston area and to be nearer 
to major transportation corridors. 
 
 
A
ir pollution can l
ead to health effects that often go unaddressed in communities 
where residents have limited financial and health care resources. Further, 
residents of 
fenceline
 
communities

neighborhoods that are directly next to a 
facility and 
are 
directly impacted by the
 

emissions

are often unable to relocate because of low home values.
 
The
 
lack 
of 
resources and the disproportionate layering of intersec
ting social 
factor
s create 
additional challenges in these communities when faced wit
h a weather event like 
Hurricane Harvey.

Houston Area 
 
 
The 
g

ast in 
southeastern Texas and is the fifth
-
most populous metropolitan statistical ar
ea in 
the United States
,
 
with a population of over 
6 
million people
 
as of 2014
 
(

. 
The Houston area is also a major industrial center and is home to hundreds of 
petrochemical facilities
, including 
two of the four largest 
petroleum 
refineries
 
in 
the
 
U

, t
he massive petrochemical complex along the Houston Ship Channel 
is 
the largest in the country
,
 
and the Port of Houston is the sixth largest 
port 
in the 
world and 
is th

second
 
largest
 
in 
the country in terms of 
total tonnage. These 
facilities 
release 
sever

types of 
air pollutants
,
 
including air toxics that can cause 
cancer or other serious health problems.

5 The National Air Toxics Assessment is the 

public

 health risk
s from 
long
-term 
exposure to air toxics 
in the 
United States
. The most recent estimate of national average cancer risk
the 
2014 National 
Air Toxics Assessment
5was estimated
 as 
30 in 1 million.
 This estimate 
has not historically accounted for SSM emissions
, however
. As 
noted on the 

Nationa
l Air Toxics Assessment
 website, the 
assessment 

not accurately capture sources that emit only at certain times (e.g., 
 startups, 
shutdowns, malfunctions and 

for 
2014, this 
screening tool 
estimate
d elevated 
risk levels for 
all census 
tracts
 in the Houston area,
6 with a countywide a
verage 
cancer risk 
of 45.89 in 1 million 
but with 
some cancer risks estimated as high as 
348 in 1 million. 
Most of the 

highest risk census 
tracts 
were 
in East and Southeast 
Houston. The Housto
n area is un
usual
 in thatdue to a lack of 
zoning 
requirements
many residential 
communities are located next 
to or near
 industrial sources of air 
pollution
. The 
number and density of industrial sources and 
their 
proximity to residents
 contribute to the ele
vated health risks in the Houston area
. The

census tract
 is a
 small, relatively p

the purpose of presenting data. Census tracts nest within counties, and their boundaries normally follow visible 
features but may follow legal geography boundaries and other nonvisible features in some insta
nces. Census tracts 
ideally contain about
 4,000 people and 1,600 housing units.

Air Monitoring Conducted 
a
fter 
Hurricane
 
Harvey
 
 
Managed by the TCEQ, t
he 
state and local air monitoring system 
(SLAMS) 
network 
in Texa
s 
collects data about 
six 
criteria
 
air 
pollutants to determine whether air quality meets the 
National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards
 
(
NAAQS
)
 
 
established by the EPA.
8
 
 
 
There are adverse health
 
effects associated with each of the six 
criteria 
air 
pollutant
s. For example, short term exposure to ozone
 
is 
associated with deaths from respiratory causes, 
while 
long
-
term 
exposure 
to 
ozone 
is linked to asthma aggravation and 
development
, as well as 
per
manent lung damage.
 
 
In addition to measuring 
criteria 
air 
pol
lutants, 

SLAMS 
routinely 
collect
s
 
data 
for over 
100
 
different air toxics
 
to 
determine 
whether 
their 
levels exceed 
Air Monitoring Comparison 
Value (AMCV) 
thresholds 
established by 
the 
TCEQ.
 
If a 
TCEQ SLAMS 
monitor 
detects a chemical concentration
 
that exceeds its associated AMCV
 
threshold
, 
adverse health effects in the public
 
are not necessarily anticipat
ed
. However,
 
the 
TCEQ
 
considers 
th
ese
 
data during 
any future 
permitting process. 
 
 
Starting on August 23, 
2017, 
before 
Hurricane Harvey made land
fall
, 
the 
TCEQ 
began preparations to shut
 
down 
its 
SLAMS 
sites and monitors
 
in the 
Houston area to 
protect the 
network 
from 
storm damage
. 
Once the storm was over, 
the TCEQ began taking steps to restore its 
air monitoring operations. 
By 
September
 
13, 
2017, 
most of 
the
 
air 
monitoring network 
in the Houston area 
was once again opera
tional
.
 
B
y 
September
 
29, 
2017, 

network 
was 
100
 
percent
 
operational.
 
                                        
        
 
8
 
T
he Clean Air Act
, as amended,
 
requires the EPA to set NAAQS for pollutants considered harmful to public health 
and the environment. The EPA establis
hed NAAQS for six principal pollutants, w
hich are called 
criteria
 
air 
pollutants
: carbon monoxide, lead, ground
-
level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. 
Per 
the act, s
tates are responsible for maintaining an air quality monitor

quality data 

 
The Clean Air Act
 
also 
requires each state to have a 
state implementation plan to attain and maintain the NAAQS. Many 
of these 
state implementati
on plan
s
 
(such as 

provisions that govern SSM events
 
and provided 
automatic exemptions from enforcement for 
facilities whose SSM emissions violate the Clean Air Act standards. In 2015, the EPA found that the SSM provisions 
included in 
the s
tate 
implementation plan
s
 
for Texas
 
and 35 other states 


 
to meet 
Clean Air Act requirements 
(
State Implementation Plans: Response to Petition for Rulemaking
, 80 Fed. Reg.
 
33840, 
33845 (June 12, 2015)). However, in April 2019,
 
EPA Region 6 proposed to deviate f

allow Texas to 
maintain its existing SSM provisions. 
As of October 2019, t
he EPA 
was revising its 
SSM policy.

Although 
the 
SLAMS 
can provide useful air quality information during or after an 
emergency, these 
fixe
d, stationary 
networks were not specifically designed for 
that 
purpose
 
and may not be able to withstand emergency conditions
. An 
emergency response may 
therefore 
require portable, remote sensing or other 
monitoring techniques to obtain air quality data
, es
pecially
 
for 
those 
locations and 
pollutants not regularly monit
ored by existing networks. Existing 
technologies

such as 
the 

Airborne Spectral Photometric Environmental Collection 
Technology (ASPECT
) 
and 
the 

Trace Atmospheric Gas Analyzer 
(TAGA)

provide 
alternative 
solutions to this issue by either analyzing remote 
infrared and photographic imagery or by directly collecting pollutant 
concentrations using gas chromatography. 
 
 
After 
Hurricane Harvey
, the EPA and the 
c
ity 
of Houston used a variety
 
of 
temporary monitoring methods to capture conditions around industrial sites. 
These efforts included monitoring conditions next to industrial 
fenceline
s with 
handheld instruments
,
 
such as toxic vapor analyzers
,
 
summa canisters
,
 
o
ptical gas 
imaging camera
s and portable multi
-
gas monitors. 
In
 
addition, 
from
 
August
 
31
 
through 
September 11, 2017, 
t
he EPA conducted 
flyovers of facilities with 
the 
ASPECT plane
, 
screening 
pollutant plumes for potential hazardous 
emissions 
near 
high priority industrial targets. 
T
he 
a
gency 
also drove a 
TAGA 
bus throughout the impacted region 
from 
September 6
 
through 
20, 2017. 
Additional air 
monitoring was conducted 
using 
portable
 
instruments 
by a 
firm under contract to the Environment
al
 
Defen
se 
Fund
, which is
 
a nongovernmental orga
nization
. 
Although t
his private
 
monitoring was not conducted at 
the request of the EPA or state and local agencies
, 
the 
results 
were 
made available to the EPA and 
the 
TCEQ.
 
 
In a
 
September 
8
, 
2017
,
 
press release
,
 
the EPA and 
the 
TCEQ 
informed
 
Houston commu
nities that available 
data 
collected around the Valero facility 
indicated that 
local residents should not be concerned about air 
quality issues related to the effects of the storm. The 
EPA issued s
ix press releases related to fuel waivers, 
four related to 
water or

specifically addressed

Scope and Methodology 
 
 
We conducted our 
audit from August 2018 through 
July 
2019. We conducted this 
audit in accordance with generally accepted 
government auditing standards. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, 
appropriate evidence to provide a reason
able basis for our findings and 
conclusions based on our objective
s
. We believe that the evidence obtain
ed 
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our 
objective
s
. 
 
 
We encountered an impediment to obtaining all the desired inf
ormation to 
complete our audit, as described below. We were still able to obtain enough 
information to a
nswer our objective
s
, although this impediment impacted our

The Arkema plant manufactures organic peroxides. Due to extensive flooding from 
Hurricane Harvey, the plant 
lost po
wer, backup power and critical organic peroxide refrigeration systems. On August 31, 2017, organic peroxide 
products stored inside a refrigerated trailer decomposed, causing the peroxides and the trailer to burn. After th
e 
vapor from the decomposing produc
ts traveled across a public highway adjacent to the plant, 21 people sought 
medical attention from exposure to the fumes. Over the next several days, a second fire and a controlled burn 
consumed eight more trailers holdin

de products. During these three fires, over 
350,000 pounds of organic peroxide combusted, and more than 200 residents living within 1.5 miles of the facility 
evacuated the area and could not return home for a week. A

to Hurricane Harvey. 
This 
survey
 
was designed 
to determine 
whether 
the 

on

the
-
ground response and Harvey
-
re
lated EPA communications were effective
. 
We distributed 
the survey 
to 
59 EPA staff who served as community liaisons 
during the response. We received 44 responses and analyzed the data.
 
 
Imp
ediment to Obtaining Information 
 
 
TCEQ staff, managers and officials 
declined to meet with us to 
discuss
 
their 
response to the hurricane and their reasoning for various decisions or actions 
described in this report. We provided 
the 
TCEQ with an initial
 
li
st of questions 
before 
scheduling a meeting at TCEQ offices in September 2018. 
The 
TCEQ 
cancelled th
e
 
meeting 
the day
 
before
 
we were scheduled to meet
 
due to an 
impending tropical storm
. 
Also, the 
TCEQ declined to meet with us during a 
subsequent week w
hen
 
we 
visited the Houston area to meet with 
c
ity officials and 
community representatives from impacted areas. Further, despite several 
conversations to arrange for written answers to our initial list of questions, we 
never received a response from 
the 
TCE
Q. 
Subsequent to our unsuccessful 
attempts to arrange meetings 
and obtain information from 
the 
TCEQ
,
 
we learned 
that 
the 
TCEQ collected 
air monitoring data 
from 
helicopter 
flyovers 
following 
Hurricane Harvey
. 
We were unable to
 
review 
those 
data as 
a 
part of t
his audit.
 
However, we believe that the evidence we obtained provides a reasonable basis 
for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objective

T

to 
the public 
during and after the

H

to monitor

Monitoring Not Conducted Du

Air Toxic 
Emission 
Incidents
 
 
In response to the Hurricane Harvey disaster, 
a 
nongovernmental organization
, 
local governmental entities and the EPA 
collected 
air monitoring data with 
four
 
distinct 
mobile
 
monitoring efforts 
over a 
span
 
of
 
21
 
days 
(August 31

Despite the broad range of monitoring efforts, this 
monitoring:

. For example, a
 
nongovernmental organization
 
collected samples over a

too short to 
analyze whether the concentrations were harmful to 
human health. 
 
 
Over half of all known 
air toxic
 
emission 
incidents 
began 
when 
no monitors
 
were operating. 
Comp

when these

31, 2017

after the TCEQ disabled its SLAMS
 
in the Houston area
 
and before the EP
A 
began collecting data with its
 
ASPECT 
flight response. Many 
of the air toxic 
emission
s during the peak incident period 
were from storage tank leaks due to excessive rainfall. However, since these 
reported emissions occurred before temporary monitoring ha
d begun or the 
SLAMS 
was 
redeployed, we were unable to assess their impact on air quali
ty.

accordi

approximately 3.9

As demonstrated in

we found that

was
 
too s

impaired the timeliness of the data

for review
. H
oweve
r, 
the 
TCEQ 
co

the data were 
unsuitable for

because 
most 
air samples were collected over a 
period lasting fewer than 
5

:

D
espite 
efforts by 
Entanglement Technologies and the 
c
ity of Houston to 
share information with 
the 
TCEQ, the 
TCEQ 
did not forward these raw

the 
EPA
. 
We also found 
no evidence that
 
the 
EPA

or that 
the

Although EPA Region 6 and the TCEQ collaborate annually to plan and train for

Further, 
the

collected 
were 
not 
always 
useful for 
assessing 
potential impacts on human health
. 
Additionally,
 
inconsistent 
formatting and 
isolated

of

prevented 
the EPA

the public

The EPA could better plan and coordinate f

high

predominantly located 
adjacent to or near large industrial 
facilities. Increased 
planning and coordination could provide these communities with 
timely 
information about their 
air quality
 
during 
an

enabl

Agency Response and OIG Evaluation
 
 
The agency disagreed with our draft report 
recommendations for this chapter
. The 
agency
 
noted that
 
each emergency is unique and that 
developing 
guidance that 
would cover all scenarios would be challenging. Further, 
per t

state and local governments are primarily 
responsible for emergency response 
efforts
,
 
with 
the 
EPA
 
regions assisting when requested. 
The 
agency said 
that 
the 
EPA has developed 
a variety of tools and procedures
 
for emergency assistance
. 
 
 
Based on discussions
 
with the 
a
gency
 
and 
its 
response to our
 
draft report, we 
revised 
our
 
recommendations for the final report
 
to better clarify 
the 
recommendations
. 
Recommendations 
1 through 3 
are unresolved
 
pending 
the 

receipt of acceptable 
cor

ed
 
to multiple pollutants. Instead, the 
thresholds 
are based on a
n individua
l exposed to 
one 
specific pollutant
 
(e.g., 
benzene
)
. 
Further, 
the 
EPA

thresholds 
do not 
consider 
chronic exposure that some 
populations, such as those residing near industrial facilities, may have already 
experience

of

.
 
 
EPA Used 
State 
Thresholds 
to Assess 

Air Quality
 
 
According to EPA 
staff
, the 
a
gency coordinates with th
e relevant 
state 
when an 
incident
 
occurs 
to determine which health
-
based thresholds to 
use when analyzing 
air monitoring results. 
A review of i
nternal 
agency 
documents from
 
September 5
 
and 6
, 2017
,
 
showed that 
there was 
confusion 
among EPA staff regarding whether 
to 
use 
the 

short
-
term 
AMCVs 
or other TCEQ 
thresholds
. Ultimately, 
the 
TCEQ decided 
that 
the EPA should use the AMCVs after discussing the issue 
with the 
federal 
a
gency
. 
The 
TCEQ and 
the 
EPA subsequently compared 
air
 
monitoring 
data 
collected 
from vario
us handheld monitors, summa canisters
, 
ASPECT
 
and the TAGA bus to the AMCVs.
 
The 
TCEQ also 
compared
 
data 
collected by the 
c
ity of Houston to the AMCVs
. None of the data were found to 
exceed
 
the AMCVs
. 
 
 
Relative to the

thresholds
 
most closely match the

, 
al
though the

between these threshold categories 
are
 
substantial and their underlying 
purposes are di
fferent.

.
 
15
 
AEGLs
, 
which address the acute (or short
-
term) effects of air toxics,
 
are established at three levels, with each level 
re
presenting the severity of health impacts. Level 1 is the lowest impact level and represents the airborne
 
concentration above which notable discomfort or irritation could be experienced, but the effects a
re not disabling and 
are 
reversible once exposure st
ops. Level 2 is the middle impact level and represents the exposure level at which 
irreversible harm
;
 
other serious, long
-
lasting adverse health effects
;
 
or an impaired ability to escape are caused. 
Final
ly, a Level 3 exposure causes life

h effects or death.

while AEGLs 
were 
developed by the EPA to 
screen 
situations involving a once

accidental exposure. As an example of the 
difference 
betwee
n these thresholds, 
the AEGL Level 1 short

m
inutes and 60 minutes) thresholds for 
1,3
-
butadiene is 670 ppm versus the
 
short
-
term
 
AMCV threshold of 1.7 ppm. 
Thus, the use of 
short
-

AMCVs as health
-
based thresholds
 
for assessing air 
quality data
 
after Harvey was more conservative

in other words,
 
p
rotective of 
health

than if AEGLs were used. 
 
 
However, t
he
 
use of 
state
 
thresholds 
to 
assess 
adequate
 
margins of safety
 
could 
lead the EPA to endorse different conclusions regarding public safety when air 
quality conditions are similar
. 
For example, 
Figur
e 
7 
shows the differences in 
common air quality thresholds 
issued by 
Texas
 
and
 
California
.

This 
lack of standardization in 
state 
air toxic threshold
s 
could
 
cause the 
EPA 
to 
provide inconsistent advice as it supports local entities in disasters. For example, 

the 
EPA 
could
 
advise local governments 
in that state 
to issue a shelter
-
in
-
place order 
if monitoring re
sults show
ed
 
a 
benzene
 
concentration of 0.1 ppm. Th
at same 
concentration
, however, would not 
have triggered 
any 
health advisories 
during
 
the Hurricane Harvey response
,
 
since 
the 

short
-
term 
AMCVs
 
have a higher threshold for benzene

face a higher lifetime risk of cancer and chronic disease 
than other 
Houston
 
communities 
exposed to 
only one or two definite

During Hurricane Harv
ey, these 
East Houston 
communities faced exposures to
 
many 
pollutants at one time. Within a 
3
-
hour period, the 
c
ity of 

Mobile 
Ambient Air Monitoring Laboratory
 
identified 
46 pollutant concentrations greater than 0 ppm 
occuring in Manchester Park 
on September 4, 
2017, including benzene (0.

,
 
n

(0.

ppm) and n
-
heptane (0.072 ppm). While 
none of these concentrations exceeded their 
respective 
short

AMCVs, this example 
illustrates the large number of 
distinct
 
pollutants 
in the air 
at that time. 
 
 
One 
limitation to using 
the AMCVs

is th
at 
neither one

A
ccumulation of consecutive distinct exposures to a pollutant over time 
(i.e.
,

As 
Figure

shows
, when compared to the rest of Harris County,
 
a 
disproportionate amount of air toxic emissions
 
reported fo
r Hurricane Harvey 
were 
within 
4 
miles of the Harrisburg/Manchester neighborhood
. These 
residents 
were 
potentially 
exposed 
to a variety of 
air 
toxic
s
,
 
such as xylene, toluene, hexane
 
and ethylbenzene
. 
However, 
the TCEQ 
only

asses
s
es
 
the 

health effects at certain exposure levels 
on a 
pollutant

there is no way of quantifying potential effects across the AMCV or AEGL

The 
EPA

 
guidance on the development of AEGLs only relies on multiple 
exposure studies when 
single exposure data 
are 
lacking
.
 
AEGLs may 
therefore 
not be protect
ive enough 
of 
disproportionately burdened comm
unities like 
Harrisburg/Manchester, given 
their
 
proximity to large industrial facilities and the 
number of air toxics they could be exposed to during large
-
scale SSM 
incidents 
before, during and after an emergency or disaster situation. 
Although 
AEGLs 
were
 
not used to make public health assessments after Hurricane Harvey
, 
with the 
exception of California, no other states have developed acute air toxic 
thresholds 
like Texas.
 
The
 
other 
states may therefore opt to use AEGLs
 
to assess air quality
.
 
 
Based on a r
eview of 
TCEQ guidance
,
 
we determined that 
cumulative risk
s
 
from 
multiple pollutant exposures are not addressed in AMCVs
. 
While 
short
-
term 
AMCVs 
are more protective of 
health t
han AEGLS 
when 
assessing exposure to a 
single air toxic, whether these values we
re sufficiently protective of health 
is 
unknown, 
considering the multiple pollutant exposures experienced after 
Hurricane 
Harvey.
 
 
Conclusion
 
 
The available monitoring data did
 
not indicate 
that air toxic levels during the 
Hurricane Harvey disaster 
exceed
e
d
 
Texas or EPA 
thresholds
. It is unclear, 
however, whether or how SSM emissions compound the health risks of 
residents in 
fenceline
 
communities.

Agency Response and OIG Evaluation
 
 
In 
this chapter in 
our d
raft report
, w
e
 
included 
one 
recommendation addressing 
the 
use of acute exposure thresholds to assess air quality during an
 
emergency
.
 
The 
agency disagr
eed with 
this
 
recommendation 
and noted that there are existing air 
quality standards 
that 
the 
EPA 
uses to estimate 
the 
risk
s
 
to communities
 
for criteria 
air 
pollutants
. 
The agency 
further explained
 
that 
the 
EPA uses its 
AEGLs
 
to assess 
public risk
 
f
r
om air
 
toxics exposure
. 
 
 
Our draft
 
report 
also 
included two 
additional 
recommendation
s
 
in this chapter 
addressing 
how to limit the 
potential health impact of multiple shutdown
s
 
and 
startups on nearby residents during an emergency. The

Lack of Communication Left Communities 
 
Unaware of Risks
 
 
We did not identify any instances of inaccurate communication regarding air 
quality 
during 
the Hurricane Harvey
 
response
 
effort
. However, 
we found that 
official 
communication 
from the EPA 
regarding air quality 
was limited
. For 
example, a lack of guidance 
r
egarding 
how 
the EPA should 
disseminate air 
quality data 
meant 
air monitoring results 
and air quality risks 
did 
not 
alwa
ys 
reach 
residents of impacted communities. In addition, the lack of a feedback mechanism 
meant field staff did not communicate how the 

. 
As a result, 
some 
communities were left unaware 
of 
important issues, which can 
lead to
 
a lack of 
trust and 
confidence

EPA Deployed Community Liaisons
 
 
EPA Region 6 deployed more than 
8
0 community liaisons to the region impacted 
by Hurricane Harvey

the fi
rst instance in which so many liaisons were u
sed 
by 
the agency
 
to respond to a disaster
, according t
o an EPA staff person
. These 
liaisons, who were
 
coordinated by three leaders
, 
provide
d
 
information to the 
public 
regarding 
how to best protect themselves fr
om environmental risks
,
 
collect
ed
 
citizen concerns
,
 
and forward
ed
 
these concerns 
to EPA management. 
The liaisons were not tasked with resolving environmental issues. 
 
 
During the Hurricane Harvey 
response effort, t
he 

community liaisons communicated 
w
ith the public 
by distributing 
preapproved flyers, 
which were 
available 
in 
English, 
Spanish and 
Viet
namese. 
The community 
liaisons 
held 
daily meetings with 
the community liaison lead
18
 
and 
maintained 
a dedicated 
environmental justice
 
email address that the 
community could use. 
D
uring our

Port

were present and

Despite concerns about
 
air quality and other issues
 
in the Houston area after 
Hurricane Harvey
, the EPA did not adequately
 
communicate important 
information 
so
 
that 
all 
impacted 
communities 
received 
it. 
A lack of information 
hindered

their health.

community liaisons.
 
 
The 
city 
of Houston also re
ceived 
public expressions of 
outdoor air quality 
concerns after Hurricane Harvey
 

. 
For example, t
he 
city 
received 
3
3 
odor complaints 
from 
August 27 
through 
September 17, 2017. Many 
o
f these 
complaints 
pertained specifically to odo
rs emanating from refineries in 
the Ship Channel area. 
 
 
In addition
,
 
a few
 
nongovernmental organizations 
requested air quality data from 
the 
EPA. 
One of t
hese 
nongovernmental organizations 
had 
contacts
 
living in 
affected communities 
who could 
reach the im
pacted constituency.
 
However, the 
EPA was not responsive to requests from 
nongovernmental organizations 
for air 
quality data.
 
 
Resolution of Concerns 
Not Commun
icated to 
Affected Residents 
 
 
The EPA lacked a process for providing 
feed
back to the community 
after 

concerns were considered resolved or addressed. 
While response 
activities were 
communicated 
daily 
to EPA 
h
eadquarters 
via 
written reports
,
 
comm
unity liaisons and field staff reported in the 

post
-
hurricane surveys 
that 
this 
informatio
n was not being relayed to field teams and that they were not 
informed 
whether 
problems were resolved. 
For example, o
ne community liaison
 
who 
communicated an incident at a local refinery up the 
established 
chain of 
command
 
subsequently 
asked about the heal
th risks 
from that incident 
and 
about 
the 
resolution 
status. That 
community liaison 
told the OIG that the only response 
received from the chai
n of command 
was that 
the 
TCEQ was taking care of 
the 
situation
. The community liaison expressed concern about the
 
community and 
whether it was exposed to health risks from the incident. 
 
 
Over half of the community liaisons 
who 
respond
ed
 
to our survey rep
orted 
hearing about air quality concerns in communities, 
but 
about half 
also said 
that

According to 
the 
survey respondents and EPA staff we 
interviewed, community 
concerns were passed up the EPA

 
chain of command and were then forwarded 
to the governmental party responsible for
 
resolving the issue (e.g., 
air quality 
concerns were forwarded to the 
TCEQ). Once the relevant party was notified, t
he 

 
Region 6 staff from the Office of 
Environmental Justice and Tribal Affairs did conduct outreach with
 
local 
government officials and community organizations;

however, some community 
liaisons reported that information 
about how issues were resolved was lacking.

conducted questionnaires, our survey and 
our 
interviews with community 
members indicated a lack of 
knowledge 
on behalf of the EPA 
about 
the needs of 

v
arious communities and how best to reach them. 
This
 
knowledge is especially critical for community liaisons to effectively 
communicate with 
environmental justice 
communities. For example, community 
liaisons should h
av
e
 
experience with 
these
 
communities 
so 
that 
the liaisons 
can 
address 
the 
cultural 
differences
, communication barriers and geographical 
challenges that make some of these communities hard to reach. Knowing when 
and where communities gather is 
also 
important 
to effectively 
communicat
e
 
and 
distrib
ut
e
 
essential information. 
 
 
We 
also 
identi
fied some concern among regional staff and managers that 
information did not reach all 
environmental justice
 
communities
. S
ome residents 

A

, 
w

some community members that
 
they 
never saw

after Hurricane Harvey. In addition, m
any community liaisons 
and 
organizations 
expressed concern abo
ut the lack of printed materials in 
languages
 
other than English that are spoken prevalently in the Houston area
. 
 
 
Conclusion
 
 
Based on the results of our review, some r
esidents impacted by Hurricane Harvey 
were
 
unaware of air monitoring results and air q
uality risks during and immediately 
after the 
hurricane
. The
 
EPA has l
imited guidance on how to disseminate air 
quality data 
and
 
l
ack
s
 
a feedback mechanism allowing 
EPA 
field staff to 
communicate 
the status of concerns to 
affected 
communities.
 
 
These chall
enges 
led to limited 
public awarenes
s of potential air quality issues
,
 
which in turn could
 
reduce public 
trust and 
confidence
 

in response to an emergency.
 
Given the number of impacts of the hurricane

including flooding, loss of 
power and the fear 
naturally instigated by 
a natural 
disaster

unaddressed 
concerns regarding 
air quality
 
likely 
compounded the 
public 
perception of 
risk

.

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the issues and recommendations in the subject audit 
report. Following is a summary of the age

ith its position on each 
of the report recommendations. For those report recommendations with which the agency agrees, 
we have provided high
-
level intended corrective actions and estimated completion dates to the 
extent we ca
n. For those report recommendat
ions with which the agency does not agree, we have 
explained our position, 
provided the legal basis
, and proposed alternatives to recommendations. 
For your consideration, we have included a Technical Comments

AGENCY

 
The report seems to make broad conclusions applicable to the Agency and several national 
programs based on the limited review of one event
 
in which flooding was the primary focus of 
the response
. 
Instead, 
a review of t
he Region 9 response to the Kilauea volcanic activity in 
Hawaii
,
 
as
 
an extended response intensively focused on air monitoring
, would provide a better 

existing processes, capabilities, and thorough coordination with st
ate 
and local agencies.
 
 
In general, the Agency does not agree with nor advise developing overarching monitoring 
guidance for emergency responses 
-
 
beyond what already exists. First, states
 
and local 
governments are responsible for their emergency response
 
efforts. If 
f
ederal assistance is 
requested, or EPA receives a mission assignment from FEMA, the response is handled by th
e
 
particular EPA Region. Each emergency is unique, as are the asso
ciated responses.

guidance for monitoring that would en
compass the myriad emergency scenarios that could 
possibl
y 
occur
 
would be challenging
. Decisions regarding monitoring are made based on an 
evaluation of the specific incident. 
Further, i
n R
egion 6, all 
s
tates have S
tate 
I
mplementation 
P
lans (SIP)
-
approved 
authority to permit planned startup, shutdown 
and
 
maintenance (SSM) 
emissions for most facilities. EPA only approves state permitting regulations.
 
EPA can
, and 
does, 
also enforce these perm
its, SIP
 
required conditions, and 
National Emission Standards for 
H
azardous Air Pollutants
.
 
Current regulations do not allow the state or EPA to dictate SSM 
schedules.
 
 
We understand from our discussions that we can propose alternatives for the draft 
recom

 
table below. In 
general, we propose to:
 
 
1.
 
remove the Office of Air and Radiation 
as an action official 
from the 
recommendations, 
 
2.
 
combine recommendations 2 and 8
,
 
 
3.
 
combine recommendations 5
 
and 6
,
 
4.
 

,

provisions into existing guidance
 
or other appropriate document(s), and
 
6.
 
focus the revisions on monitoring 
related to permitted and non
-
permitted air toxic 
releases during an
 
emergency event rather than hazardous air pollutants covered 
by SIPs.

and these revisions 
have been coordinated with the Office of Air and Radiation,

There are already existing air quality 
standards [National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards (NAAQS)]. They do not change 
during emergency responses. During a 
response, if we detect a speci
fic 
contaminant 
of concern, we go to the 
existing acute values for that chemical in 
order to estimate risk to communities. 
These values already exist (e.g., AEGLs) 
and indicate the concentrations at which 
public health impacts may occur for a 
particular ch
emical hazard. I
n the rare 
instance that there is no established value 
for a particular substance, one is 
developed based on existing data or by 
using existing tools to estimate toxicity. 
This is done in coordination with entities 
such as EPA's ORD, ATSDR,
 
and other 
exper
ts in toxicology and risk assessment. 
AEGLS are expressed as specific 
concentrations of airborne chemicals at 
which health effects may occur. They are 
designed to protect the elderly and 
children, and other susceptible 
populations.

OIG Response #
6
:
 
We 
recognize 
that 
there are 
existing air qua
lity standards for criteria air pollutants, 
but 
there are 
no federal air quality standards for air toxics. We also acknowledge that the EPA 
developed the AEGLs for assessing public health risk from exposure to air toxics during an 
emergency
. However, t
he 
A
EGL
s
 
do not account for cumulative or aggregated exposures to 
airborne
 
chemicals
, meaning the
 
AEGLs
 
may not be 
sufficiently protective 
of 
sensitive communities.
 
Additionally, Texas developed its own acute exposure 
thresholds
,
 
and a key deci
sion during the 
Hurricane 
Harvey response was 
whether to use the state or EPA thresholds 
as action levels
. Our report 
does not question the selection of the thresholds used for
 
the response. 
After further discussions with 
the agency and among OIG managemen
t, we have withdrawn this recommendation.

understand that 
the 
EPA 
cannot dictate when a facil
ity should shut
 
down or 
start up in response to an emergency and that characterizing the risk from these exposures is difficult. 
However, a public health concern during the Hurricane Harvey 
response
 
was the potential health 
impact 

exposure to
 
air toxics from multiple facility 
SSMs
 
during a condensed time 
period. We therefore believe that Region 6 should develop a strat

in coordination with its states

mergencies. 
Based on discussions with the 
a
gency, we revised and combined two draft report recommendations 
(Recommendations 5 and
 
6) into one 
final recommendation 
(Recommendation 
4
). The final report
