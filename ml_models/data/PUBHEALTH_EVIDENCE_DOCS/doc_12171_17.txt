 Falling inside the post-oak savannah Gould ecoregion, there is an actual iconic round rock!
 The round rock in Brushy Creek is where old 19th century wagons made low water crossings.
 There are many parks to explore including old settlers Park as well as trails to visit like the chisolm trail at the Chisolm Trail park which aren&apos;t far neighbors to the Rock&apos;n River Waterpark.
 There is a small downtown area near Mays street where nightlife is centered, but traveling to Austin can be a more lively experience.Current ResidentJan 13 2019Overall ExperienceReportRound Rock is my home town, it is great to have kids in.There is an opportunity for everyone in the family to do anything they would like.
 I have recently got a summer job in the city and can&apos;t wait to start working.
 On top of this, my sister and I have gone to many programs and events that our city has put on.
 These things keep us busy in the summer and give us something to look forward during the school year.
 The city even offers events for my dogs.
 They have really amazing dog parks that are awesome hangouts for every dog lover and their loyal companion.
 One summer they even did dog birthday parties!
 The only thing I would like my city to add is more art museums.
 I understand Round Rock is a suburb but it would still be nice to have a more established and permanent art museum to call our own.Current ResidentMay 16 2019Overall ExperienceReportRead More ReviewsAdd to ListNicheAbout UsNiche For SchoolsNiche For CollegesBlogContact NicheDataCareersPartnershipsPressDo Not Sell My InfoPrivacy PolicyUser AgreementCookie PolicyInstagramFacebookTwitterTiktok©2020 Niche.com Inc.Discover the schools, companies, and neighborhoods that are right for you.K-12CollegesGraduate SchoolsPlaces to LiveDo you work for a school or college?

 It is calculated using the reported number of students and full-time equivalent teachers.
 You learn about many different type of people because of the diversity as well.
 This improves your social skills, your ability to easily navigate large areas (which is great for college), and many more!
 RRHS prepared me for college significantly.
 However, I do believe RRHS should be more careful in choosing which teachers\u002Fstaff to hire and monitor the staff closely.
 I recommend this because I personally and many other students have had many negative encounters with staff.

 I am A kid who is annoying and I have never been to a school more accepting and kind.
 The principal is very nice, I wish everywhere I went , the world was like here.
 The teachers are outstanding!
 Mrs Jeffreys was probably my favorite.
 She is very funny and all the teachers are understanding and they all care deeply about you.
 It was absurd to hear of kids doing drugs or smoking, sadly I moved out of the district, when I got to high school everything was different.
 The cheer program was also an amazing experience.
 Middle school is hard, and was something I hated until I went here.
 Another amazing thing was the cafeteria, they had a snack room, It has cookies, yogurt, pudding, ice cream, dipping dots, slushees, pretzel machine, etc.
 It was the best school I had ever been in, if you want a good school go here.
 Best school ever!

 The athletic program is rigorous and extremely rewarding for students looking to pursue sports.
 A huge number of excellent clubs that meet regularly.
 Academic curriculum is practical and teaches students exactly what they need to know in order to be prepared for future challenges.
 Lots of useful opportunities for students looking to pursue AP classes in high school, and for students who wish to accelerate.
 Amazing library, and really supportive teachers.
 Students maintain a friendly and welcoming environment throughout the school.
 I would highly recommend the school for all kinds of students, whether they are interested in extracurricular activities, sports, or academics.

 The staff and administration genuinely care about the students and strives to motivate them towards success.
 The Academy is a College Preparatory school and therefore, highly focuses on academics and critical thinking alongside instilling study habits and mature behavior to all grade levels!
 In addition to academics, the clubs, activities, and sports maintain a very motivated structure as the school holds many state champion titles and has a great reputation of respectable kids!
 There are, however, a few downsides to the school.
 Because of the small population, there is a lack in a wide diversity.
 This is not by the school's choice, simply the outcome of a costly private school.
 Personally speaking, the price is worth the schooling as the institution prepares students for college, instills Christ-like values, and offers a unique sense of belonging to all who walk on the campus.

 I am able to work from home 2 days of the week so this cuts down in my commuting time during the work week.
 My manager is located out of a different state and most leaders are very flexible and understanding of working from home and encouraging of finding balance between work\u002Flife.
 The staff is wonderful and the hospital amenities are nice compared to those within the area.
 Aside from pay, this is a great place to work.
 The staff in all departments I have encountered (and I have encountered almost all departments) are knowledgeable and supportive of each other.
