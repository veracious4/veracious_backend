Ithas also favorably impacted Chicago's overallhandgun homicide rate relative to other cities onceeconomic and demographic factors are considered.The Chicago handgun ban has saved ihundreds oflives.Chicago's handgun ban also has reduced the sup-ply of handguns, which reduction is correlated with areduction in handgun crime. The ban has also pro-tected Chicago's citizens from the increase in crimeassociated with increased availability of handguns.Finally, the arguments raised by amici in supportof Petitioners with respect to the efficacy of thehandgun ban fail for several reasons. In particular,the data actually show that, post-ban, the number ofhandgun homicides in homes has decreased and thatChicago residents are now safer in their homes thanthey were before the ban.III. ARGUMENTA.The Chicago Handgun Ban Has Re-duced Handgun Violence.For over 25 years, the City of Chicago's handgunban has been an effective part of Chicago's efforts toreduce handgun crime. In 1982, the City Councilfound that the convenient availability of firearms andammunition had increased firearm-related deathsand injuries. Chicago City Council, Journal ofProceedings, Mar. 19, 1982, at 10049. To address the 3significant problem of handgun violence and toprotect its citizens, on March 19, 1982, the CityCouncil enacted the handgun ban here at issue.Today, although its rates of violent crime are ator near a 30-year low, Chicago, like many large U.S.cities, continues to experience significant amounts ofhandgun violence. Tracy Meares et al., Homicide andGun Violence in Chicago: Evaluation and Summary ofthe Project Safe Neighborhoods Program 1 (2009),http://www.psnchicago.org/PDFs/2009-PSN-Research-Brief_v2.pdf. The University of Chicago Crime Labestimates that "the social costs that gun violenceimposes on Chicago [over the last ten years] are onthe order of about $2.5 billion each year." Universityof Chicago, Gun Violence Among School-Age Youth inChicago 5 (2009), http://crimelab.chicago.edu/pdf/Gun_Violence_Report.pdf.Because the motives giving rise to homicide arevaried,~ no single government response alone iscapable of reducing homicide. As a result, over thelast several decades, Chicago has relied on variousapproaches (discussed infra) to address the differentunderlying factors that lead to handgun homicide. Its2 The Chicago Police Department ranks the top fivemotives for homicide in Chicago as street gang altercations,other altercations, domestic altercations, armed robbery, andgangland narcotics. Chicago Police Department, MurderAnalysis in Chicago 24-25 (2008), https://portal.chicagopolice.org/port al/page/ClearPath/News/Statistical%20Reports/Homicide%20Reports/2008%20Homicide%20Reports/MA08.pdf. 4handgun ban has played an important role incombating gun violence and has reduced handgunviolence, saving hundreds of lives.1.Background of the Chicago HandgunBan.Chicago's handgun ban prohibits the registrationof new handguns. Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code § 8-20-050(c). Chicago's handgun ban exempts handgunsthat were validly registered prior to the effective dateof the handgun ban and requires those lawful ownersto renew their registration annually. Chicago, Ill.,Municipal Code §§ 8-20-050(c); 8-20-200(a). Inaddition, the ordinance does not prohibit the lawfulownership of long guns, such as rifles and standardshotguns. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code § 8-20-050.Chicago's handgun ban is less restrictive, incertain respects, than the handgun legislation atissue in District of Columbia v. Heller, 128 S. Ct. 2783(2008). Chicago does not require registered owners ofhandguns and long guns to keep their guns unloadedand disassembled or bound by a trigger lock while intheir residence. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code § 8-20-010 et seq.; cf. Heller, 128 S. Ct. at 2822 (notingthat District of Columbia ordinance required lawfulfirearms to be rendered inoperable in the home, andtherefore not available for immediate self defense). 52.The Chicago Handgun Ban HasEffectively Reduced Homicides inFamily andIntimate PartnerRelationships.The Chicago handgun ban has been effective inreducing homicides involving family members andintimate partners. The available data indicate that,by diminishing the availability of handguns, theChicago handgun ban has helped prevent familydisputes and domestic violence from escalating tohomicide.(a) Handgunsand Fatal FamilyViolence.As the Court recently noted, "[f]irearms anddomestic strife are a potentially deadly combinationnationwide." United States v. Hayes, 129 S. Ct. 1079,1087 (2009). Handguns contribute to the escalation ofviolence to a deadly level. See Philip J. Cook, TheTechnology of Personal Violence, 14 Crime & Just. 1,47 (1991). When guns are used in a family or intimateassault, death is twelve times more likely theoutcome than if another weapon is used. Linda E.Saltzman et al., Weapon Involvement and InjuryOutcomes in Family and Intimate Assaults, 267JAMA 3043 (1992). The "combination of the readyavailability of guns and the willingness to usemaximum force in interpersonal conflict is the mostimportant single contribution to the high U.S. deathrate from violence." F. E. Zimring & G. Hawkins, 6Crime is Not the Problem: Lethal Violence in America122-23 (1997).(b)The Number of HomicidesInvolving Family Me:mbers andIntimate Partners in ChicagoHas Decreased After the Hand-gun Ban.Amicis' analysis of the available dal:a~ indicatesthat the number of homicides involving familymembers and intimate partners4 declined steadilyafter the enactment of the handgun ban. SeeAppendix at App. 1, Figure 1.The drop is even more pronounced whenhomicides involving semiautomatic and automatichandguns, which are associated with gang and drug~ The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authoritycompiled and archived victim-level data on homicides in Chicagofrom 1965-1995. Carolyn R. Block & Richard L. Block, Homicidesin Chicago, 1965-1995 (2005), http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cocoon/NACJD/STUDY/06399.xml. Covering 17 years before and 13years aider the enactment of the handgun ban, the databasecontains information such as the type of weapon used, rela-tionship between perpetrator and victim, whether the homicidewas gang related, and location of the homicide.4 The term "intimate partners" includes spouses, ex-spouses, boyfriends, and girlfriends. Carolyn R. Block & RichardL. Block, Homicides in Chicago, 1965-1995: Codebook for Part-l:Victim-Level Data 84 (2005), http://www.icpsr.um:ich.edu/cocoon/NACJD/STUDY/06399.xml. activity,5 are excluded from the data. See Appendix atApp. 2, Figure 2.Chicago's decrease in the number of intimatepartner handgun homicides with a female victim wasalso much larger than the nationwide average. Whiledomestic violence rates have been steadily decreasingnationwide, Chicago's intimate partner homicideswith female victims have gone down by a much largerpercentage. Because of the relatively small data setand its volatility from year to year, amici averagedthe number of intimate partner/female victimhomicides in the six years before the ban (1976~1981)and the twelve years after the ban (1982-1993).~ TheUnited States experienced a 4.3% drop in intimatepartner homicides with female victims from the pre-ban period to the post-ban period. Chicago's drop overthe same period was 27.2%.The analysis by amici also showed that thereduction in handgun homicides contributed to an~ See, e.g., The Boston Gun Project and Operation CeaseFire, Case Study 1 (2005), http://www.fti.ibis.com/DOWNLOADS/Publications/CaseStudy-BostonGunProject.pdf (finding preferencefor semiautomatic handguns among gang members).6 Arnici selected 1976 as the starting point because it wasthe first year that the Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) wereavailable. Amici used 1993 as the ending point because theBrady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which prohibitedstalkers and domestic violence perpetrators from possessing anyfirearm, was enacted on November 30, 1993. 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8)and (9). 8overall reduction in family/intimate partner homicidesin Chicago. This suggests that when handguns arenot present, a less lethal weapon is :ased or thedispute does not escalate. Thus, the evidencedemonstrates that Chicago's handgun ban saves livesby reducing the number of handgun homicidesinvolving intimate partners and family members.3.The Chicago Handgun Ban Con-tributed to an Overall Reduction inthe Ntunber of Handgun Homicides.Chicago's handgun ban has als,~ favorablyaffected Chicago's overall handgun homicide rate.Although Chicago experienced an increase in hand-gun homicides in the late 1980s-early 1990s, theincrease was part of a nationwide crime surge relatedto the introduction of crack cocaine. While Chicago'shandgun homicide rates were slightly higher than theaverage of 39 other large cities, those results changeonce demographic and economic characteristics areconsidered. After controlling for those factors, thehandgun homicide rate in Chicago was actually lowerrelative to other cities as a result of the handgun ban.(a)Shortly After the Enactment ofthe Handgun Ban, Crack-RelatedHandgun Violence iBecame aNationwide Problem.The trends in Chicago's handgun homicide ratemust be examined in the context of national homicide 9patterns. Beginning in the latter half of the 1980s,cities across the nation experienced a dramaticincrease in violent crimes largely associated with theemergence of the crack cocaine market and relatedgang activity. See Lawrence Rosenthal, SecondAmendment Plumbing After Heller: Of Standards ofScrutiny, Incorporation, Well-Regulated Militias, andCriminal Street Gangs, 41 Urb. Law. 1, 4-5, 10 (2009)(noting consensus among criminologists that crimespike was due to introduction of crack cocaine). Theincrease in violent crime was largely driven byhandgun-related crime. Alfred Blumstein & RichardRosenfeld, Explaining Recent Trends in U.S. HomicideRates, 88 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 1175, 1206(1998).Crack markets generally emerged first in thelargest cities. Blumstein & Rosenfeld, supra, at 1206."[L]arge cities had a major growth [in handgunhomicide] beginning in 1986, increasing 85% from1985 to the flat 1991-1993 peak, and then declining37% to the low in 1995." Id. With respect to smallercities, the increase in handgun homicides did notoccur until two years later, in 1988, and the peak wasalso later. Id. In Chicago, where handgun homicideshad declined after the ban in 1982, handgun homi-cides began to increase after 1987, reflecting theemergence of the crack cocaine market and its impacton the City's homicide rate. See Carolyn R. Block &Richard L. Block, Homicides in Chicago, 1965-1995,supra, at 2.Amici analyzed the FBI's Supplemental HomicideReports (SHR) data to compare Chicago to 39 other 10large cities7 whose crime statistics were reported in amanner consistent with FBI protocols. From 1976-2008, handgun homicides in Chicago were slightlyhigher than the 39 city average, but generally roseand fell along with other cities. See Appendix at App.3, Figure 3.Thus, the suggestion by International LawEnforcement Education & Trainers Ass'n et al. asamici in support of Petitioners (hereinai~er "ILEETA")that it was Chicago's handgun ban, rather than theintroduction of crack cocaine, that caused post-bancrime increases, Brief of ILEETA at 21-22, is simplynot supported by the data. Rather, as set forth below,Chicago had fewer handgun homicides than othercities when demographic and economic, profiles ofcities are considered.7 Those cities are Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Birmingham,Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Clevela:ad, Columbus,Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Fort Worth, Houston, Indianapolis,Kansas City, Las Vegas, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Memphis,Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orlea:as, New York,Newark, Oakland, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, Phoenix,Pittsburgh, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco,San Jose, Seattle, St. Louis, and Washington D.C. Cities inFlorida were not included because their data are not consistentwith FBI protocols. James Alan Fox et al., Multiple Imputationof the Supplementary Homicide Reports, 197~]-2005, 25 J.Quantitative Criminology 51, 53 (2009). 11(b)When Demographic and Eco-nomic Factors Are Considered,the Chicago Handgun Ban HasHad the Desired Impact on theReduction of Handgun Violence.Although Chicago tends to have a slightly higherrate of homicide than average, the ban reducedChicago's rate of handgun homicide,s Using FBI data,amici compared Chicago to 39 other large U.S. citiesand evaluated the data before, during, and after thecrack-related crime surge of the late 1980s-early1990s (discussed supra), as well as before and afterthe Chicago handgun ban was enacted.Cities differ considerably from one another interms of their economic and demographic profiles.With respect to crime rates, there are two factors thatare especially significant. The most critical is relativesize of the economic underclass. "Empirical evidenceconsistently demonstrates that crime rates, andespecially rates of violent crime, are particularly highin areas of concentrated poverty." Rosenthal, supra,at 9-10; see also Philip J. Cook et al., UndergroundGun Markets, 117 Econ. J. F558, F562 (2007) ("gun8 Some amici in support of Petitioners argue that Chicago'shandgun ban is ineffective, using direct comparison of thenumber of homicides in Chicago with those of Los Angeles andNew York. Brief of Heartland Institute at 6 n.3; Brief of BuckeyeFirearms Foundation Inc. et al. at 8, 10. These comparisons donot control for demographic, socio-economic, and geographicalvariants and thus do not provide a valid basis for assessing thehandgun ban's effectiveness. 12crime in America is disproportionately concentratedin large cities and within these cities occursdisproportionately in highly disadvantaged neigh-borhoods").The second factor - related to economic disad-vantage - is the percentage of the population thatis African-American. African-Americans, particularlyAfrican-American men, are dramaticall:g overrepre-sented as both victims and perpetrators of homicide.See Rosenthal, supra, at 9-10; see also Chicago PoliceDepartment, Murder Analysis in Chicago, supra, at31, 40 (finding that 74.8% of homicide victims and76.1% of homicide offenders were African-Americanin 2008).9The analysis conducted by amici includes twovariables to account for these correlates of crimerates. A detailed description of the methodology andresults is set forth in the Appendix. See Appendix atApp. 4-7.Using these variables, amici calculated thereduction in Chicago's handgun homicides attributable9 The nationwide crime spike between the mid-1980s toearly-1990s "hit young, African-Americans particularly hard;from 1984 to 1993, the homicide victimization rate per 100,000for whites aged eighteen to twenty-four rose from 11.9 to 17.1,while the homicide rates for African-American males in thesame age range rose from 67.9 to 183.4." Rosenthal, supra, at 9,citing James Alan Fox, Demographics and U.S. Homicide in TheCrime Drop in America 300 (Alfred Blumstein & Joel Wallmaneds., 2006). 13to the handgun ban. The data suggest that theChicago handgun ban reduced the number ofhandgun homicides in Chicago by approximately 6-9%,depending on which alternative model specification isused. See Appendix at App. 1, Figure 1. After theenactment of the Chicago handgun ban, from 1983 to2008, the handgun ban reduced the homicide rate inChicago, on average, by nearly 1 person per 100,000population each year. Over the period 1983-2008, thismeans that between 677 and 942 handgun homicideswere prevented by the ban.Other studies have made similar findingsrelative to Chicago's handgun crime rates. Cook et al.found that, when controlled for race, urbanicity, andpopulation, Cook County (which is dominated byChicago and includes the Village of Oak Park) scoredsix percentage points lower in 1994-1996 forproportions of homicides and robberies involving afirearm than the other 200 largest U.S. counties.Cook, Underground Gun Markets, supra, at F580.ILEETA compared Chicago's performance to thatof the mean of 24 other U.S. cities. Brief of ILEETA at17-24. The ILEETA comparison does not account forimportant variables among cities that are provenindicators of homicide rates. As a result, from astatistical standpoint, ILEETA's use of averages is not 14a reliable indicator of whether Chicago's handgun banis effective.1°By contrast, statistical analysis of the handguahomicide data by amici and others indicates that theChicago handgun ban saves lives.B.Chicago's Handgun Ban Reduces theSupply and Increases the Cost of Hand-guns.Chicago's handgun ban, combined with confis-cation and other law enforcement activities, effec-tively reduces the supply of handguns in the City.Decreased availability of handguns reduces crime aswell as suicide and accidental shootings. See Cook,Underground Gun Markets, supra, at F582 ("The bestevidence indicates that an increase in gu~.~ prevalenceresults in more homicides, burglaries, and perhapssuicides as well.") (citations omitted).lo Furthermore, the statement that the difference in crimerates before and after the ban found by ILEETA is "highlystatistically significant" is meaningless. Statistical significanceis used to determine whether a difference observed in a samplewould hold true for the population. When dealing with crimerates, there is no sample; rather, the data being studiedconstitute all the events that occurred in the population. 151.The Chicago Handgun Ban Makes ItMore Difficult to Obtain HandgunsIllegally.The Chicago handgun ban inhibits the supply ofhandguns. Efforts to control the market for handgunsfollow two basic strategies: supply-reduction anddemand-reduction. The supply-side initiatives, suchas the Chicago handgun ban and the Brady HandgunViolence Prevention Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 921-22, attemptto limit the availability of guns either across-the-board or to certain specified groups. See Anthony A.Braga et al., The Illegal Supply of Firearms, 29 Crime& Just. 319, 340-41 (2002). Demand-side approaches,such as gang intervention programs and specialprosecution of gun offenders, strive to lessen the needor desire within offender populations to carry and useguns for illegitimate purposes. See, e,g., Cook,Underground Gun Markets, supra, at F570-71(describing police intervention to deal with possessionof guns by gang members in Chicago).Chicago employs both supply-side approaches,such as the Chicago handgun ban, and demand-sideapproaches, such as Project Safe Neighborhoods,which is a Department of Justice funded programthat focuses on the reasons offenders use guns andtheir attitudes toward the law and law enforcers.Meares, supra, at 1, 2.Although guns from jurisdictions with morepermissive gun control laws can influence theeffectiveness of attempts to regulate the supply of 16guns, research shows that even when substitute gunsfrom out-of-state enter a jurisdiction with supply-sideregulations, such as Chicago, the price of such out-of-state, illegally imported guns is higher, therebyinhibiting demand.In cities such as New York and Boston,where the prevalence of gun ownership islow because legal transactions are subject toonerous regulations or are banned, prices inthe secondary market are higher than inother east coast locales. The street prices ofguns are actually higher than the prices ofguns in gun stores. As a result, dealers havelong been able to make a profit by buyingguns in Virginia or points south and runningthem northward to the street markets ofnortheastern cities. The high price of guns inthe secondary market in New York andBoston is the direct result of the regulationof the primary market.Philip J. Cook et al., Regulating Gun Markets, 86 J.Crim. L. & Criminology 59, 72 (1995). The increasedprice of out-of-state guns purchased in jurisdictionswith strict gun control measures suggests that evensupply-side regulations can decrease the demand forguns by effectively increasing the price for substituteguns. See id. at 79.Moreover, in 2008, Chicago police seized about7,400 guns and another 6,000 were voluntarilysurrendered. Chicago Police Department, 2008 AnnualReport: A Year in Review 36 (2009), https://portal.chicagopolice.org/portal/page/portal/ClearPath/News/ 17Statistical%20Reports/Annual%20Reports/2008%20Annual%20Reports/08AR.pdf. Over the past decade,Chicago police have confiscated an average of 10,800guns per year. Id. The crackdown on illegal guns inChicago has made them harder to obtain and moreexpensive.As a University of Chicago report noted:With around 250 million guns already incirculation in America (Cook and Ludwig,2006), it is not surprising that many peoplehave come to believe that it is impossible tokeep guns out of the hands of youth,criminals, and other high-risk people. Butour own study of the underground gunmarket in Chicago suggests that, perhapssurprisingly, conventional wisdom may beoverly pessimistic. Transaction costs inunderground gun markets are substantial:prices are high relative to the legal gunmarket; wait times are considerable;mistrust is common between buyers andsellers; and many transaction attempts gounfulfilled, even by people who are well-connected in the underground economy.University of Chicago, supra, at 9. Thus, supply-sidegun control laws, while unable to completelyeliminate the illegal gun market, are nonethelesseffective in reducing handgun availability. 182.Increased Availability of HandgunsCorrelates with Increased Levels ofHandgun Violence.The increased difficultly in obtaining handgunsillegally in Chicago is significant because of thecorrelation between handgun availability and hand-gun violence. In 2008, handguns were used in 71percent of murders involving firearms and 47 percentof all reported murders in the United States. See FBIUniform Crime Reports, Expanded Homicide DataTable 8 (2008), http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/offenses/expanded_information/data/shrtable_08.html; see alsoChicago Police Department, Murder Analysis in Chi-cago, supra, at 22 (finding that handguns accountedfor 402 out of the 412 homicides committed with agun in Chicago in 2008). The high rate of handgunhomicides in the United States is due, at ]least in part,to the high rate of handgun ownership. Matthew Milleret al., Rates of Household Firearm Ownership andHomicide Across US Regions and States:. 1988-1997,92 Am. J. of Pub. Health 1988 (200211 (surveyingstudies establishing the correlation between firearmavailability and homicide). Researchers have foundthat "increases in gun ownership lead to increases inthe number of homicides," and estimate that a tenpercent increase in handgun ownership ilacreases thehomicide rate by two percent. See Mark Duggan,More Guns, More Crime, 109 J. Pol. Econ. 1086, 1095-98, 1100-01, 1104 (2001).Handgun availability is also correlated with thenumber of homicides, accidental shootings, and suicides 19in children. Matthew Miller et al., FirearmAvailability and Unintentional Firearm Deaths,Suicide, and Homicide among 5-14 Year Olds, 52 J.Trauma 267, 271 (2002). Indeed, within the UnitedStates, children aged 5-14 living in the five stateswith the highest gun levels (Louisiana, Alabama,Mississippi, Arkansas, and West Virginia) were 16times more likely to die from unintentional firearminjury, 7 times more likely to die from firearm suicide,and 3 times more likely to die from firearm homicidethan children in states with the lowest gun levels(Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey,and Delaware). Id. at 271-72. The authors concludedthat "on average, where there are more guns childrenare not protected from becoming, but are rather muchmore likely to become, victims of lethal violence." Id.at 273.When United States children aged 5-14 arecompared with their counterparts in industrializednations, the firearm-related homicide rate is 17 timeshigher, the firearm-related suicide rate is 10 timeshigher, and the firearm-related unintentional deathrate is 9 times higher. Matthew Miller et al., FirearmAvailability and Unintentional Firearm Deaths, Sui-cide, and Homicide Among 5-14 Year Olds, supra, at267.If the Chicago handgun ban were no longer inforce, the supply of legal and illegal handguns wouldnaturally increase. Moreover, the price of handgunsin illegal sales (for example, to felons and minors)would presumably drop and the supply would 2Oincrease as a result of legal sales. The supply in theunderground market would also increase due to theftof newly purchased legal handguns.[T]he legal market for guns and legalownership patterns affect supply in theunderground market through their. Withsomewhere between 200 and 250 mill:ion gunsin private hands in the US, many of which arestored unlocked in order to be readily availablefor use against criminal intruders, it is notsurprising that a large number of guns (over500,000) are stolen each year.Cook, Underground Gun Markets, supra, at F560-61.An increase in legal handgun availability would havethe consequential effect of increasing children's accessto handguns.By helping Chicago avoid these undesirableoutcomes, the Chicago handgun ban has been aneffective means of protecting Chicago's citizens fromthe increase in crime related to increased, availabilityof handguns.C.Amici in Support of Petitioners Miscon-strue the Statistical Data Concerning theImpacts of the Chicago Handgun Ban.1.Homicides in Homes Have DecreasedPost-Ban.The number of homicides that occurred in victims'homes declined in Chicago after the enacl;ment of thehandgun ban. See Appendix at App. 8, Figure 4. 21The decrease was especially pronounced for thosehomicides in which handguns other than automatic/semiautomatic firearms (i.e. the guns associated withongoing criminal activity) were used. See Appendix atApp. 9, Figure 5.Chicago Police Department data also confirmthat the number of homicides in residences hascontinually declined from 1991, in which there were359 such homicides, to 2008, in which there were 109such homicides. Chicago Police Department, MurderAnalysis in Chicago, supra, at 10.Thus, the fear of increased crime in the homeexpressed by some amici in support of Petitioners, seeBrief of Buckeye Firearms Foundation Inc. et al. at 8,25; Brief of Heartland Institute at 12-13; Brief ofILEETA at 22-23; Brief of Professors of Philosophy etal. at 5-9, 34, is not supported by the data. Rather,the data show that post-ban, Chicago residents havebeen safer in their homes.oOther Arguments Regarding theEfficacy of Chicago's Handgun BanAlso Fail.Various amici in support of the Petitioners claimthat the handgun ban has either been ineffective orhas actually increased gun violence and decreased thesafety of Chicago's citizens. However, these conten-tions cannot withstand close scrutiny. 22First, the rate of murder of law enforcementofficers is not a reliable indicator of whether thehandgun ban is effective. Certain amici contend thatChicago police officers are killed at a rate higher thanthe national average. Brief of ILEETA at 24. However,the size of this data set is relatively small. :For example,according to the table in the ILEETA brief, over atwelve year period from 1996-2008, twelve lawenforcement officers were killed in Chicago. Brief ofILEETA at App. C. At a rate of one episode per year, oneadditional fatality would cause a 100% rate increase.Meaningful statistical analysis cannot be drawn fromdata subject to such wide swings with the occurrence ornonoccurrence of rare events.11 Although the rate ofmurder of law enforcement has understandableemotional appeal, it does not yield valid conclusionson the handgun ban's effectiveness.Second, at least one amici in support of thePetitioners contends that it is "clear" that re-legalization of handgun ownership "has had nodeleterious effect" in the District of Colurnbia. Brief ofILEETA at 12. However, such a contention meritsscant consideration given the brief time period thathas elapsed since the Court's decision in Heller. Itwill be years before the effects of Heller in the Districtof Columbia can be determined.11 It was for this reason that when studying handgunhomicides involving intimate partners and fi~male victims(which involved a larger data set than law enforcementmurders), amici aggregated the data. 23Finally, certain amici in support of Petitionersallege that various scholars in the field of criminologyhave recanted their support of gun control. Brief ofProfessors of Philosophy et al. at 17-28. Suchdiscussion is neither relevant nor accurate. By way ofexample, Amici Professors assert that the "mostdramatic" recantation came from the late ProfessorMarvin E. Wolfgang. Id. at 24. Professor Wolfgangmerely commended a group of researchers for theirmethodology and remained a gun control proponentuntil his death. Marvin E. Wolfgang, A Tribute to aView I Have Opposed, 86 J. Crim. L. & Criminology188, 191 (1995).IV.CONCLUSIONSince 1982, the Chicago handgun ban has servedas an effective legislative response to the tragedy ofurban handgun violence and has saved hundreds oflives. The judgment of the Court of Appeals should beaffirmed.Respectfully submitted,ELIZABETH A. RITVOAMANDA BUCK VARELLA**Counsel of RecordDYLAN P. KLETTERALBERT W.

The data set used to estimate theparameters of the model was comprised of 40 cities,including Chicago, all of which had populations overone-quarter million and reported homicide dataconsistently to the FBI.The multi-level analysis includes severalindicator variables to assess the impact of theChicago gun ban on handgun homicide rates in thatcity in contrast to trends in the remaining cities, afteradjusting for important control variables and timetrends. Specifically, the model includes (in addition toa baseline constant reflecting starting values for cityhandgun homicide rates in 1976) three trendvariables (one for 1976-1984, one for 1985-1993, andone for 1994-2008) to segment trends before, duringand after the nation's crack epidemic, as well as twoeconomic/demographic control variables (percent offamilies below the poverty line and percent blackpopulation, both based on the 2000 Census) to adjustfor important differences among cities in crime-correlates. Moreover, a dummy variable1 indicating1 A dummy variable (also known as an indicator variable)takes the values 0 or 1 to represent the absence or presence of(Continued on following page) App. 5Chicago data, a dummy variable indicating post-banChicago data, and a post-ban trend variable specificto Chicago were used in four alternative specifi-cations to measure the overall effect of Chicago's gunban.The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1.Models 1 and 2 omit the Chicago dummy indicator,while Models 3 and 4 include it. Moreover, Models 1and 3 treat the impact of the gun ban as a constant,while Models 2 and 4 treat the impact as changingover time. Regardless of specification, the Chicagohandgun ban appears to have reduced the rate ofhandgun homicide in that city, relative to handgunhomicide trends in other cities, all adjusted for timeperiod and the two demographic/economic correlates.The estimated coefficient for BAN (-0.9053 and-0.9648 for the Chicago dummy absent and theChicago dummy present, respectively) represents theaverage difference in handgun homicide rates (justunder 1 homicide per 100,000 residents), whilealternatively the coefficient for TBAN (--0.0894 and-0.0941 for the Chicago dummy absent and theChicago dummy present, respectively) indicates theaverage change in the handgun homicide rate fbreach year post-implementation (about .09 homicidessome categorical effect expected to impact upon the outcomevariable.

Comparing across models, the Chicagogun ban has reduced the number of handgunhomicides in Chicago by approximately 6-9%.Accordingly, dozens of homicides have been preventedeach year as a result of the gun ban over the period1983-2008. This means that between 677-942handgun homicides were prevented by the ban. Blank Page  Blank Page kiloFrequencyIIIII Blank Page FrequencyIIII
