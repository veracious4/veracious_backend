 Boy, was I wrong.
 Carmel is beautiful- sophisticated, charming, kind, innovative and stocked with families all working to create a beautiful life for their kids and themselves.
 Infrastructure is top notch and well-planned, the homes and neighborhoods are gorgeous and affordable, the area is filled with good, high-paying jobs, the public school facilities are amazing, and quality of teaching and programs offered - both public and community programs- are outstanding.
 Like another poster said, come visit- you will be amazed!
 I’ve met so many transplants, and some who moved just after seeing Carmel during a visit with friends.
 I can’t imagine another city offering the quality of life we have in Carmel, we are so grateful to live here.
 This city is the poster child of forward-thinking leadership as well as listening to what it’s residents want.Read 265 ReviewsA+Overall Niche GradeA+Public SchoolsB+Crime &amp; Safety90,163 PopulationAdd to ListView Nearby HomesBrooklineSuburb of Boston, MA 127 reviews#10 Best Places to Live in AmericaCurrent Resident: Every day I feel grateful to live in such a safe, beautiful, and diverse town like Brookline!
 The town of Brookline is very close to downtown Boston (15-20 minute train ride at the most).
 That being said, there are plenty of amenities available in Brookline itself that make traveling downtown necessary only occasionally, including Trader Joe&apos;s and many delicious restaurants and bars.
 Having grown up in a major city, I appreciate how safe I feel in Brookline even late at night.
 The town attracts people from all over the world, many of whom move here for professional opportunities.
 I have never had to worry about the streets being plowed in the winter, as the town is extremely on top of it!
 Honestly, this is as close to a Utopia town as you can get, and the only downside is that the housing stock is pretty old and expensive.
 Your best bet is to buy an apartment if you can and make it over, or find a rental property that the landlord is willing to renovate.Read 127 ReviewsA+Overall Niche GradeA+Public SchoolsBCrime &amp; Safety59,234 PopulationAdd to ListView Nearby HomesLos AlamosTown in New Mexico 17 reviews#14 Best Places to Live in AmericaFormer Resident: Los Alamos is in a remote but idyllic ponderosa pine setting atop 5 mesas (7,500 ft elevation) overlooking the Rio Grande valley.

 It is a wonderful place for raising a family...safe environment...good school system...lots of free activities designed for young families.

 Its a cute area and has many walkable restaurants/shops, but diversity is a major issue.
 Mt Lebanon is overwhelmingly white and does not have many cultural sites or attempts at inclusivity.
 Even the restaurants in the area are mainly Eurocentric.
 The school district is fantastic at surface level, but fails to provide students with an adequate education about the history of nonwhite countries, present day struggles for people of color, and doubles down on white washing literature and American history.
 If the issue of diversity in this town was actually talked about and those in charge began instituting changes, this would be a fantastic place to live and raise a family, but it is impossible to ignore this huge red flag.Read 81 ReviewsA+Overall Niche GradeA+Public SchoolsBCrime &amp; Safety32,540 PopulationAdd to ListView Nearby HomesBrentwoodSuburb of St. Louis, MO 23 reviews#49 Best Places to Live in AmericaCurrent Resident: Strong Community in a great location with close proximity to downtown, excellent, small schools and family friendly.

 In the summer, I bike ride constantly around the area, and I never feel worried about my safety in Buffalo Grove.
 In order to explore some activities beyond food and dessert, you may need to venture into nearby suburbs.
 However, you don&apos;t need to travel far to experience pedal boating at Independence Grove, indoor skydiving and outlet malls at Rosemont, and other awesome options to do with friends or family.
