 Tony Kurdzuk/The Star-Ledger  NEW YORK— Gov.
 Chris Christie can't get enough of "Saturday Night Live.
 "One day after ducking questions about Twinkies-maker Hostess shutting down to avoid giving comedians fodder and saying he's on "SNL" enough, Christie made a cameo appearance on the show's "Weekend Update" segment.The tough-talking governor poked fun at his notoriously short temper and the familiar blue fleece jacket that he has worn while touring the state following superstorm Sandy.Christie thanked the Red Cross and first responders.
 He also thanked his wife, who he said has put up with "a husband who has smelled like a wet fleece for the last three weeks.
 ""You have been wearing that fleece a lot," Seth Meyers noted.
 "Oh yeah, it's basically fused to my skin at this point," Christie quipped later adding, "I'm going to die in this fleece.
 "He took a swipe at New Jersey officials who failed to follow his orders before Sandy, refusing to thank "any of the stupid mayors" who ignored his evacuation orders, calling them "idiots.
 "After the storm, Christie blasted Atlantic City Mayor Lorenzo Langford but Langford shot back, defending the city's use of its emergency shelters.While delivering his SNL rant, Christie also harped on the media for putting themselves at risk to cover the storm.
 "I also do not want to thank the reporters that put themselves in danger, you know, by walking into the middle of the hurricane with their cameras.
 We don't need you to tell us there's a hurricane.
 We have windows," he growled.Lastly, Christie chided residents who started screaming matches at gas stations with long lines even though "screaming at people at gas stations is a New Jersey tradition but you don't do it during a crisis.
 There will be plenty of time for yelling when this is all over," he said.Christie closed by quoting a verse from the Bruce Springsteen song, "Atlantic City.
