 The content will focus on how new research and innovation in this rapidly evolving arena are increasing understanding of the causes of disease and leading to new kinds of treatments.
 The second project will examine a broad range of science topics in the news by presenting scientific evidence and putting it in context.
 The goal is to help readers stay up-to-date on the science community’s latest research so they can make informed decisions on subjects ranging from the environment to public health.
 The multimedia series is set to include text, video, infographics and data visualizations.
 "This collaboration brings wider attention and new storytelling tools to evidence-based, factual science," said AP Executive Editor Sally Buzbee.
 "We are excited to work with HHMI's Department of Science Education to ensure important science journalism reaches news consumers across the globe."
 With funding from HHMI's Department of Science Education, the largest private, nonprofit supporter of science education in the country, AP will increase the number of science-related stories it provides to thousands of news organizations and add additional journalists to support its current science reporting team.
 As an organization led by scientists, HHMI will also offer expert background information and educational material.
 "Science and technology play an enormous role in our society, but many media outlets have been forced to reduce their newsrooms and their coverage.
 There is a great need to promote a better understanding of science and how it works," said Sean B. Carroll, vice president of HHMI's Department of Science Education.
 "We’re proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the world's most respected news organization to ensure that the best evidence around important scientific topics is presented clearly and distributed widely."
 The collaboration with HHMI allows AP to expand its already vibrant coverage of science, medicine and health, to which its journalists around the world contribute every day.
