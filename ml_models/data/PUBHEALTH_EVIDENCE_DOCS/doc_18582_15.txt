Practitioners across many specialties - including urologists, gynecologists, reproductive endocrinologists, medical endocrinologists and many in internal medicine and family practice â€“ will see men with suboptimal fertility and reproductive problems.
 The book provides an excellent source of timely, well-considered information for those training in this young and rapidly evolving field.
 While several recent books provide targeted 'cookbooks' for those in a male reproductive laboratory, or quick reference for practising generalists, the modern, comprehensive reference providing both a background for male reproductive medicine as well as clinical practice information based on that foundation has been lacking until now.
 The book has been extensively revised with a particular focus on modern molecular medicine.
 Appropriate therapeutic interventions are highlighted throughout.
