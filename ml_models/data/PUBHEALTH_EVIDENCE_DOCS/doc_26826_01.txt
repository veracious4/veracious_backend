Trends in 1-Year Mortality Among Nonelderly Adults Initiating Dialysis, by State Medicaid Expansion Status View LargeDownload Mortality rates were measured from the 91st day following dialysis initiation for all patients who started dialysis during the specified half-year periods.
 For each half-year period, the population ranged from a maximum of 11 260 patients to a minimum of 9547 patients for expansion states and from a maximum of 7592 patients to a minimum of 6191 patients for nonexpansion states.
 Expansion states were restricted to those that expanded Medicaid beginning January 1, 2014.

  Was the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) associated with lower mortality for persons with end-stage renal disease?Findings 
  In this observational study of 236 246 nonelderly patients with end-stage renal disease initiating dialysis comparing mortality between the preexpansion period and the postexpansion period, the change in 1-year mortality among patients in Medicaid expansion states compared with those in nonexpansion states was −0.8% vs −0.2%, a difference that was statistically significant.Meaning 
  Among patients with end-stage renal disease initiating dialysis, the ACA Medicaid expansion was associated with significant improvements in 1-year survival.
 Abstract
          Importance 
  The Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion may be associated with reduced mortality, but evidence to date is limited.
 Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are a high-risk group that may be particularly affected by Medicaid expansion.Objective 
  To examine the association of Medicaid expansion with 1-year mortality among nonelderly patients with ESRD initiating dialysis.Design, Setting, and Participants 
  Difference-in-differences analysis of nonelderly patients initiating dialysis in Medicaid expansion and nonexpansion states from January 2011 to March 2017.Exposure 
  Living in a Medicaid expansion state.Main Outcomes and Measures 
  The primary outcome was 1-year mortality.
 Secondary outcomes were insurance, predialysis nephrology care, and type of vascular access for hemodialysis.Results 
  A total of 142 724 patients in expansion states (mean age, 50.2 years; 40.2% women) and 93 522 patients in nonexpansion states (mean age, 49.7; 42.4% women) were included.
 In Medicaid expansion states, 1-year mortality following dialysis initiation declined from 6.9% in the preexpansion period to 6.1% after expansion (change, −0.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −1.1 to −0.5).
 In nonexpansion states, mortality rates were 7.0% before expansion and 6.8% after expansion (change, −0.2 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.5 to 0.2), yielding an adjusted absolute reduction in mortality in expansion states of −0.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to −0.2).
 Expansion was associated with a 10.5-percentage-point (95% CI, 7.7-13.2) increase in Medicaid coverage at dialysis initiation, a −4.2-percentage-point (95% CI, −6.0 to −2.3) decrease in being uninsured, and a 2.3-percentage-point (95% CI, 0.6-4.1) increase in the presence of an arteriovenous fistula or graft.
 Changes in predialysis nephrology care were not significant.Conclusions and Relevance 
  Among patients with ESRD initiating dialysis, living in a state that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act was associated with lower 1-year mortality.
 If this association is causal, further research is needed to understand what factors may have contributed to this finding.
 Introduction
           The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid eligibility to nonelderly citizens and permanent residents with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level in participating states.
 As of September 2018, 33 states and Washington, DC, had adopted Medicaid expansion, while 17 states had not.1 These expansions have been associated with improved coverage, access to care, preventive care, and in some studies, self-rated health.2-5  Research examining Medicaid’s effects on physical health outcomes has yielded conflicting findings.
 A randomized trial of Medicaid coverage in Oregon failed to detect statistically significant 2-year changes in glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, or cholesterol levels,6 while 2 studies reported significant declines in mortality following Medicaid expansions in the early 2000s and Massachusetts health reform in 2006.7,8 Some policy observers have cited uncertainty about the effects of insurance to claim that the ACA could be scaled back without serious health consequences.9 Most studies on the ACA have focused on population-wide changes in health outcomes; however, expanded coverage may disproportionately affect populations with serious chronic illnesses.
 Compared with the general population, persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) experience increased morbidity and mortality, lost productivity, and impaired quality of life.10 Access to effective predialysis care can improve survival, but many patients receive little or no nephrology care before starting dialysis.10,11 Furthermore, although Medicare provides insurance to most patients requiring dialysis, coverage does not typically begin until the fourth month of dialysis.12 Prior to Medicaid expansion, up to one-fifth of nonelderly patients lacked insurance coverage when initiating dialysis.10,13 Being uninsured is associated with inadequate access to recommended predialysis care, underdiagnosis of diabetes and hypertension (the 2 leading causes of ESRD), and undertreatment of cardiovascular disease.13-15  This study examined the association of the ACA Medicaid expansions with mortality, insurance coverage, and predialysis nephrology care for patients with ESRD initiating dialysis.
 Methods
            
         Study Design
           Brown University’s institutional review board and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Privacy Board approved the study protocol and waived the need for informed consent.
 We conducted a difference-in-differences study that examined changes in outcomes among new dialysis patients in states that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA compared with changes among patients in nonexpansion states.
 The study period extended from January 1, 2011, to March 31, 2017.
 We defined the postexpansion period for each state based on its own implementation date (eAppendix in the Supplement).
 Data Sources and Study Population
           We obtained data from the CMS Renal Management Information System (REMIS).
 Incident patients were identified from the ESRD Medical Evidence Form (CMS 2728), which is included in the REMIS data (eAppendix in the Supplement) The CMS 2728 form provides evidence of a diagnosis of ESRD for Medicare eligibility and “demographic and diagnostic information for all new ESRD patients regardless of Medicare entitlement.”16 CMS requires the form to be completed for all newly diagnosed patients with ESRD at the time of receiving the first maintenance dialysis treatment or transplant, including those who do not have current Medicare coverage and those who do not anticipate applying for future Medicare coverage.
 The form is not collected for patients with acute kidney injury who are treated with dialysis.
 Information on timing and cause of death was obtained from the ESRD Death Notification (CMS 2746).
 CMS requires that the dialysis facility last responsible for a patient’s maintenance dialysis submit the form within 2 weeks of the date of death.
 The study population included all US patients aged 19 to 64 years who initiated dialysis (either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) during the study period, with the exception of 69 529 patients with Medicare coverage (without Medicaid), 40 758 patients with dual Medicare-Medicaid coverage, and 4125 patients with Veterans Affairs (VA) coverage without Medicare.
 Sensitivity analyses included those with Medicare and VA coverage.
 Further descriptions of the outcomes and number of patients for secondary outcomes are provided in the eAppendix, eFigure 1, and eTable 1 in the Supplement.
 Measures
           The primary outcome was whether a patient died during a 1-year period beginning with the 91st day following the initiation of dialysis.
 This approach is consistent with that used by the US Renal Data System because deaths among incident patients are not reliably reported within the first 90 days following dialysis initiation.10,16,17  Four secondary outcomes were Medicaid coverage, being uninsured, predialysis receipt of care from a nephrologist, and presence of an arteriovenous fistula or graft (either viable or maturing) during the first outpatient treatment session.
 Analyses of the presence of an arteriovenous fistula or graft were limited to patients starting hemodialysis.
 The dialysis facility collected and reported information on race/ethnicity using fixed categories in the CMS 2728 form.
 Race/ethnicity was included in the study to adjust for changes in the demographic composition of states over time and to conduct stratified analyses of the association of expansion with health outcomes.
 To obtain information on area-level poverty, patients’ residential addresses were geocoded to census tracts using ArcGIS spatial mapping software, version 10.5.1 (ESRI).
 The 2009-2013 American Community Survey provided the poverty rate in each patient’s census tract.
 For 13.2% of patients who could not be geocoded to a census tract but for whom zip codes were available, we used zip code–level poverty as measured in the 2010 US Census.
 Further descriptions of the regression specification and alternative approaches to handling missing data are described in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
 Exploratory subgroup analyses by age, race/ethnicity, and area-level poverty rates tested the significance of 3-way interactions among expansion status, postexpansion time period, and each aforementioned subgroup.
 Similarly, interactions between state and postexpansion time period yielded state-level adjusted changes.
 The number needed to treat (NNT), defined as the absolute change in insurance coverage divided by the absolute change in 1-year mortality, was calculated.
 Sensitivity Analyses
           The following analyses assessed the validity of the difference-in-differences study design and tested the sensitivity of the estimates to alternative study populations and time periods.
 First, an analysis confirmed that pre-ACA outcomes were parallel in expansion and nonexpansion states by testing the significance of an expansion-by-time indicator for the pre-2014 data.
 Second, to examine whether the composition of patients with end-stage renal disease changed differentially after expansion (ie, whether coverage expansion was associated with a change in which patients initiated dialysis, and how far along in their disease trajectory), additional difference-in-differences models estimated the following outcomes: the log of the number of incident patients, prevalence of comorbid conditions, peritoneal dialysis rates,19 and estimated glomerular filtration rate, a measure of kidney function, at dialysis initiation.
 Third, we excluded states that had expanded Medicaid to many nonelderly adults prior to 2014, following previous research.3 Fourth, because deaths among patients initiating dialysis are particularly undercounted in the first 42 days, an analysis of 1-year mortality beginning on the 43rd day after dialysis initiation was conducted.17 Fifth, observations for 15 months before and 6 months after expansion were excluded, treating them as transitional periods.
 Sixth, an analysis examined deaths for conditions amenable and not amenable to health care.7,8 Seventh, we examined changes for nonelderly persons with Medicare, dual Medicare-Medicaid, and VA coverage, who should not have been affected by the ACA Medicaid expansions.
