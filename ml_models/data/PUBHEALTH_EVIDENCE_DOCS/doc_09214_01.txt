Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD)/ACCORD Follow-On Study (ACCORDION) CONSORT Diagram View LargeDownload In the ACCORD study, eligible participants underwent 2 sequential randomizations, the first to intensive vs standard glycemia therapy followed by a second randomization to intensive vs standard blood pressure or lipid treatment in a double 2 × 2 factorial design.
 In the ACCORD lipid trial, participants were randomized to either fenofibrate or placebo on a background of statin therapy.
 Following completion of ACCORD, a total of 4644 surviving Lipid trial participants agreed to extended passive (nontreatment) follow-up in ACCORDION.
 Rates of occurrence of cardiovascular end points during the original study and during extended follow-up were assessed in all study participants with censoring for the last date of follow-up.Figure 2.

  Does fenofibrate reduce cardiovascular disease risk in statin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes?Findings 
  In this posttrial follow-up of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Lipid Study, fenofibrate therapy was associated with reduced cardiovascular disease in study participants with dyslipidemia, defined as triglyceride levels greater than 204 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels less than 34 mg/dL.Meaning 
  Extended follow-up of ACCORD-lipid trial participants confirms the original neutral effect of fenofibrate in the overall study cohort; the continued observation of heterogeneity of treatment response by baseline lipids suggests that fenofibrate therapy may reduce CVD in patients with diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
 Abstract
          Importance 
  Patients with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in part owing to hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
 It is unknown whether adding triglyceride-lowering treatment to statin reduces this risk.Objective 
  To determine whether fenofibrate reduces CVD risk in statin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes.Design, Setting, and Participants 
  Posttrial follow-up of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Study between July 2009 and October 2014; 5 years of follow-up were completed for a total of 9.7 years at general community and academic outpatient research clinics in the United States and Canada.
