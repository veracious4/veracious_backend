 Among those contributors -- Las Vegas mogul Sheldon Adelson.
 The CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, which includes properties such as The Venetian and The Palazzo, contributed $500,000 against the initiative on Oct. 20.
 Adelson could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
 Overall, more than $8.5 million has been spent both for and against Prop.
 205 so far.
 The charts below show how much each side of Prop.
 205 has received so far.
 NOTE -- contributions smaller than $10,000 from September 20 to today have not yet been published, likely making both totals higher.
