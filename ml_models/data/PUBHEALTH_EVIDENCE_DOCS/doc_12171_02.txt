 Just Living!Former Resident14 days agoOverall ExperienceReportI love living here!
 There is a large art community, tons of opportunity for musicians, and plenty of nature to be submerged in.
 The people here are nice compared to where I originally come from.
 There is a large sense of community.
 I also thoroughly enjoy the food - there are so many restaurants, food trucks, and hidden little mom-and-pop shops.
 Austin is home to a huge vegan community, and I really appreciate that as someone who has been vegan for 8 years.
 There is constantly something new to try!
 I appreciate the expressiveness of the community - art is truly everywhere.

 It is calculated using the reported number of students and full-time equivalent teachers.
 The school is lacking in diversity, and though it's working on it, needs to improve diversity in its recruiting.
 The best part of LASA by far is the teachers, who go above and beyond for their students and surpassed by expectations of public school teachers.
 The amenities are sub-par, sports and the arts are not well-funded, and the administration can put up a lot of road blocks for student learning.
 The Fire Academy with LBJ is amazing and one of a kind!
 Most LASA parents are a little over the top, and anybody knows that the PFLASA crowd is crazy.
 It is calculated using the reported number of students and full-time equivalent teachers.
 We get a lot of hate for being an “all white, rich suburban” school, but in my opinion that’s all just white noise and envy about our success.
 The academics are rigorous and challenging.
 Teachers are accessible to the students for tutoring or outside help.
 The campus is always warm and inviting, and the athletics here is a perennial powerhouse!
 The students are very kind and helpful to any new student.
 Everyone is able to find their role here and excel at what they’re best at.
 Finally, college readiness is excellent.
 Even as a sophomore I know I’m going to get into a great college and later a job.
 I love Westlake for all these reasons, people can say what they want!
 It is calculated using the reported number of students and full-time equivalent teachers.
 This school prepared me well for a career in STEM.
 That said, for students who are less academically inclined there are more suitable programs that focus more on the \"typical high school experience\".
 Going to Westwood and the pressure that it puts on students to be the absolute best in everything and be overly competitive is not conducive to a nurturing learning environment.
 To be in the top quarter students need to be in all AP or IB classes, and need to earn mostly high A's in every course.
 For me this included staying up until 2 or 3 in the morning every single night.
 Just be warned in advance!
 Amazing school, but its a big burden and shouldn't be taken lightly.
 It is calculated using the reported number of students and full-time equivalent teachers.
 Students are encouraged to exceed in their studies, and the teachers are very supportive.
 Overall, I have had a great experience at Vandegrift!
 The only complaint I have about the school is the poor quality of food that is provided at the cafeteria, but that is a district-wide issue, not just Vandegrift.

 It is a challenging school academically, but the teachers are also just smart and inspiring people to learn from.
 I feel really lucky that I get to be a part of the SAS community.
 Being a teenager is hard no matter what school you go to, but at our school I feel like its just easier because there is an environment of acceptance and everyone is in it together.
 I have great friends at this school and I do feel like being here will open doors for me later in life both in academics and also with the networking I am doing.
 The campus is very beautiful and I appreciate how much green space there is too.
 It is calculated using the reported number of students and full-time equivalent teachers.
 With wholeheartedly invested teachers, numerous opportunities to shine in interscholastic tournaments like Debate, MIST, and Science Fair, life long relationships with my peers, and an Islamic environment, I can confidently say that APA has given me everything I need and more to succeed.
 This school has taught me how to embrace my Muslim American identity unapologetically.
 Apart from the stellar academics APA students display, they are taught to be equally as compassionate and empathetic as well.
 I will miss the great relationships I’ve built here, but I can’t wait to see APA continue to grow and flourish in the years to come!

 My husband and I have toured over a dozen schools over the years and between our five children have attended 6 different schools.
 We have three children in the elementary school and from the top of admin to volunteers it’s everything I had hoped for.
 My kiddos are thriving and love going to school.
 Recently they had to implement remote learning and it was as if they had it all planned out ahead of time.
 Every child has their own chrome book and the lessons (from what my friends in all other Austin schools tell me) are far superior to what others are receiving.
 The academics are super strong but it wouldn’t be fair not to mention the feeling that HP gives us that we are family.
 It is calculated using the reported number of students and full-time equivalent teachers.
 She truly achieved milestones in her education that I don’t believe she would have achieved in another school setting.
 Small class sizes, elective options that cater to academics, arts and athletics, she was exposed to and received a diverse education in an environment that supports inclusion by all.
 With many school events, socialization is encouraged as well as collaboration with peers through arts showcases and athletic team events.
 The faculty at Griffin truly develop relationships with the students and demonstrate care for student achievements.
 As a mother fully vested in my daughter’s success, I credit Griffin with so much of her growth into a strong and independent minded woman prepared to face the world before her.
 It is calculated using the reported number of students and full-time equivalent teachers.
 I’ve been impressed at how the teachers differentiate instruction and provide extra challenges to students who are ready for them.
 The students are encouraged to dive deep and explore concepts way beyond the surface level.
 Ive been impressed by the focus on leadership and community.
 We have seen the school through some big transitions over the years, and feel confident that the quality of education has only improved.
 The teaching staff is stellar—inspired and inspiring.
 Highly recommended.
 Great people, great schools, great lifestyle (restaurants, parks, shops, grocery, bars, etc), and quick easy commutes to Downtown to South or Domain\u002FAboretum\u002FMLS Stadium and so much more to North.
 Growing the way it should.
 Love it!
 's definition of this crime, use caution when comparing to other locations.
 Through it all, it seems that the culture of team member happiness and customer service has not changed.
 It is still an environment that is conducive to healthy eating, still showcases culinary trends, and still expediting what the customer wants.\n  I've worked numerous roles at Wholefoods Market.
 I've worked in both large and small store formats, in teams of 8, or in teams of 30.
 I've also worked in major cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles.
 I feel that the experiences I've had with wholefoods have entrusted me with a worldview, one that is difficult to learn in a school environment alone.
 The skills I have learned from working in a team-based environment have served me well at school, in group projects, and in communicating with professors.
 All this while working in a culture that supports my educational endeavors, honoring my school schedule through the years.
 All the administrative staff care for you and want you to succeed, and you can definitely feel it.
 Lunch and learns provides an opportunity for you to network, learn about vendor services, and get free lunch!
 Classes are offered everyday to help you understand some things that were not taught during your real estate licensure.
 Productivity coaches are there to help you build your business plan and execute it.
 I assist them bathing, meal prep, cleaning and most important providing a listening ear.
 I love when I can enter their house and bring a smile to their face.
 Many elderly clients dont have family or adequate care and no one to visits and I provide these services with a smile and a hug.
 I would like to see other providers give the love and effort to assist them.
 Providers get into the job for money, but its way more than that.
 They dont understand that one day the will age and need the same professional care they are hired to do.
