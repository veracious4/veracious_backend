 Trump Misleads on H1N1 Swine Flu Testing           July 16, 2020      Deflecting attention from the rise in COVID-19 cases, President Donald Trump has repeatedly said the Obama administration “stopped testing” during the H1N1 pandemic.
 But the two viruses are very different, making the comparison misleading.
 Flu Shot Doesn’t Cause False Positive Results for COVID-19           May 19, 2020      A viral claim on Facebook erroneously tells users that “you will test positive” for COVID-19 if “you’ve gotten flu shots during the past ten years.” Vaccine and infectious disease experts told us that’s false, and the Food and Drug Administration says this hasn’t been observed in any authorized tests.
 Trump’s Flu Shot Reticence           May 15, 2020      President Donald Trump cast doubt on the value of influenza vaccines, saying he only got a flu shot because he was required to as president.
 “I don’t know if I should have.
 Who knows?” But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says each year the vaccine saves thousands of lives and prevents tens of thousands of hospitalizations.
 FactChecking Trump’s Coronavirus Press Conference           February 27, 2020      Facing a declining stock market and criticism from Democrats, President Donald Trump and other officials have minimized the risks of the coronavirus to the U.S. and given inaccurate and misleading information about the new virus.
 Instagram Post Falsely Links Flu Vaccine to Polio           October 18, 2019      A popular Instagram post falsely claims “over 1,100 people died from reactions to the [flu] shot” in 2018, and suggests that the immunization gave some children polio.
 The flu vaccine cannot give anyone polio and there is no evidence to support the 1,100 figure.
 No Evidence New York Legislator Died from Flu Shot           December 7, 2018      A self-described “alternative news” story suggests the flu shot was responsible for the death of a New York state senator.
 The official cause of death is still pending.
 Trump Didn’t Call Flu Shot a ‘Scam’           December 4, 2018      President Donald Trump did not call the flu shot a “scam,” as is being claimed by a number of widely circulated blog articles.
