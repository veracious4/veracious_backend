 Both types of cancer are often diagnosed late and have poor survival rates.Scientists hope detecting the cancers earlier will lead to more effective treatment and help save lives.The test is also expected to reduce the need for unpleasant endoscopy examinations that require a flexible telescope to be inserted into the stomach via the throat.

 For oesophageal cancer, around 8,919 people are diagnosed and 7,790 die.

 "This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications.
 "A breath test could be used as a non-invasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies.
 In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival.
 "The results of the study, presented at the European Cancer Congress meeting in Amsterdam, showed that the test was both good at identifying those patients who had cancer, and unlikely to produce a false diagnosis.Over the next three years, the researchers plan to run a larger trial including patients not yet diagnosed with cancer.The team is also working on breath tests for other types of cancer, such as those affecting the bowel and pancreas.
