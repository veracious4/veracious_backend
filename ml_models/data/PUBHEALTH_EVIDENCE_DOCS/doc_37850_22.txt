“The Ulta Beauty team delivered results for the fourth quarter at the high end of our expectations, and I am proud of how our teams worked together to serve our guests this holiday season,” said Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer.
 “Our enhanced omnichannel capabilities, combined with our merchandise exclusives, cross-category marketing events, and great execution by our store teams, enabled us to expand our market share and deliver a successful quarter.”  For the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2019   Net sales increased 8.5% to $2,305.9 million compared to $2,124.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018;   Comparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) increased 4.0% compared to an increase of 9.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
 The 4.0% comparable sales increase was driven by 1.8% transaction growth and 2.2% growth in average ticket;   Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 35.0% compared to 34.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to improvement in merchandise margins driven by marketing and merchandising strategies, partially offset by investments in salon services;   Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 90 basis points to 22.4% compared to 21.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to investments to support future growth, deleverage in marketing expense, and higher payroll and benefit-related expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense;   Pre-opening expenses increased to $3.6 million compared to $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
 Real estate activity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 included 13 new stores and two relocations, compared to 12 new stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018;   Operating income increased 2.3% to $287.8 million, or 12.5% of net sales, compared to $281.2 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018;   Tax rate was 22.7% compared to 24.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
 The lower effective tax rate is due to federal income tax credits;   Net income increased 3.7% to $222.7 million compared to $214.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018; and   Diluted earnings per share increased 7.8% to $3.89, which included a $0.06 per share benefit due to an increase in federal income tax credits, compared to $3.61 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
 For the Full Year of Fiscal 2019   Net sales increased 10.1% to $7,398.1 million compared to $6,716.6 million in fiscal 2018;   Comparable sales increased 5.0% compared to an increase of 8.1% in fiscal 2018.
 The 5.0% comparable sales increase was driven by 3.3% transaction growth and 1.7% growth in average ticket;   Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points to 36.2% compared to 35.9% in fiscal 2018, primarily due to improvement in merchandise margins driven by marketing and merchandising strategies and leverage of fixed store costs, partially offset by investments in salon services;   SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 90 basis points to 23.8% compared to 22.9% in fiscal 2018, primarily due to investments to support future growth and higher payroll and benefit-related expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and leverage in marketing expense;   Pre-opening expenses decreased to $19.3 million compared to $19.8 million in fiscal 2018.
 Real estate activity in fiscal 2019 included 86 new stores, 12 remodels, and eight relocations, compared to 107 new stores, 13 remodels, and two relocations in fiscal 2018;   Operating income increased 5.5% to $901.1 million, or 12.1% of net sales, compared to $854.1 million, or 12.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2018;   Tax rate decreased to 22.1% compared to 23.3% in fiscal 2018.
 The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to income tax accounting for share-based compensation and federal income tax credits;   Net income increased 7.2% to $705.9 million compared to $658.6 million in fiscal 2018; and   Diluted earnings per share increased 11.1% to $12.15 which included a $0.30 per share benefit primarily due to income tax accounting for share-based compensation and federal income tax credits, compared to $10.94 in fiscal 2018, which included a $0.09 per share benefit due to income tax accounting for share-based compensation.
 Balance Sheet  Merchandise inventories, net at the end of fiscal 2019 totaled $1,293.7 million compared to $1,214.3 million at the end of fiscal 2018, representing an increase of $79.4 million.
 The increase in total inventory was driven by 80 net new stores.
 Average inventory per store was flat compared to fiscal 2018.
 The Company ended fiscal 2019 with $502.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.
 On March 11, 2020, the Company entered into an Amendment No.
 1 to Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, which amended and restated the existing agreement.
 The new loan agreement extends the maturity of the facility to March 11, 2025, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $1.0 billion or a percentage of eligible owned inventory, contains a $50 million sub-facility for letters of credit and allows the Company to increase the revolving facility by an additional $100 million.
 Recent Accounting Pronouncement – Leases  On February 3, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842 using the modified retrospective approach.
 The new standard requires leases to be recorded on the balance sheet as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets.
 Upon adoption, the Company recognized and measured leases without revising comparative period information or disclosures.
 The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recording of operating lease assets and liabilities of $1.46 billion and $1.84 billion, respectively, as of February 3, 2019.
 As part of the adoption, the Company recorded an adjustment to retained earnings of $2.4 million.
 Share Repurchase Program   During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company repurchased 681,458 shares of its common stock at a cost of $174.1 million.
 During fiscal 2019, the Company repurchased 2,320,896 shares of its common stock at a cost of $681.0 million.
 As of February 1, 2020, $214.6 million remained available under the $875.0 million share repurchase program announced in March 2019.
 On March 10, 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.6 billion, which replaces the prior authorization implemented in March 2019.
 Under the new program, as under the previous program, the Company may repurchase outstanding shares of the Company's common stock from time to time through accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 The new program has no expiration date but may be terminated by the Board at any time.
 Since 2014, Ulta Beauty has returned $2.2 billion to shareholders through its share repurchase program, while continuing to make strategic growth investments.
 Store Expansion  During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company opened 13 stores located in Allen, TX; Blaine, MN; Dallas, TX; Gonzalez, LA; Houston, TX; Louisville, KY; Madison, AL; Meridian, MS; Moore, OK; Phoenix, AZ (2); Sioux Falls, SD; and Wentzville, MO.
 The Company ended fiscal 2019 with 1,254 stores and square footage of 13,193,076, representing a 6.9% increase in square footage compared to fiscal 2018.
 Outlook  For fiscal 2020, the Company plans to:   open approximately 75 net new stores, execute approximately 15 remodel or relocation projects, and complete approximately 42 store refreshes;   increase total sales by approximately 7.0% to 8.0%;   achieve comparable sales growth of approximately 3.0% to 4.0%;   deleverage operating income margin rate in the range of 70 to 80 basis points;   deliver diluted earnings per share in the range of $12.55 to $12.75, including the impact of approximately $1.3 billion in share repurchases and assuming an effective tax rate of between 24% and 24.5%;   incur capital expenditures between $280 million and $300 million;   incur depreciation and amortization expense between $310 million and $320 million; and   incur net interest expense of approximately $9.0 million.
