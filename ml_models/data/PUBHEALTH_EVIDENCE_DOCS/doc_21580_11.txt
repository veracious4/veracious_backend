 This preliminary report includes national and state estimates of total deaths and death rates, as well as statistics on life expectancy,
 infant mortality,
 and causes of death. Data are shown for the following race and ethnic groups: white, non-Hispanic white, black, non-Hispanic black, American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), Asian or Pacific Islander (API), and Hispanic populations. Tabulations
 by race and ethnic group are based on the race and ethnic group reported for the decedent. Race and Hispanic origin are reported as separate items on the death certificate. Death rates for AIAN, API, and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic populations are known to be too low because of reporting problems (see ‚‚Race
 and Hispanic origin™™
 in ‚‚Technical
 Notes™™).
 Changes in death rates from 2008 to 2009 were tested for statistical significance. Differences
 in death rates across demographic groups (but occurring in 2009 only) were also tested for statistical significance. Unless otherwise specified, reported differences
 in death rates are statistically significant. Age-adjusted death rates are better indicators than crude death rates for showing changes in the risk of death over time when the age distribution of the population is changing, and for comparing the mortality of population subgroups that have different
 age compositions. All age-adjusted death rates are standardized to the year 2000 lation (see ‚‚Computing
 rates and percentages™™
 in ‚‚Technical
 Notes™™).
 Two
 measures of infant mortality are shown: the infant death rate and the infant mortality rate (see ‚‚Infant
 mortality™™
 in ‚‚Technical
 Notes™™).
 These measures typically are similar,
 although they can differ
 because they have different
 denominators. The denominator of the 2009 infant death rate is the estimated population under age 1 year on the reference date of July 1, 2009 (14). This estimated population includes a combination of infants born in 2008 who had not reached their first birthday by July 1, 2009, and infants born in 2009 before July 1. In contrast, the denominator of the 2009 infant mortality rate is all live births occurring in 2009. The infant mortality rate is a better indicator of the risk of dying during the first year of life than the infant death rate. This report includes data for 30 states and the District of ColumbiaŠArkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
 New Mexico, New York,
 North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas,
 Utah, Vermont,
 Washington,
 and WyomingŠthat
 had implemented the 2003 revision of the U.S. dard Certificate of Death by 2009, and for the remaining 20 states that collected and reported death data in 2009 based on the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death. The 2003 revision is described in detail elsewhere (15,16). In this report, revised data are combined with unrevised but comparable data. More details on cedures used to combine revised with unrevised data on race are given in ‚‚Technical
 Notes.™™
 Because the 2000 U.S. census allowed for selection of multiple races, death certificate data by race (i.e., the numerators for death rates) are not wholly compatible with the population data collected in this census. Data from the census are necessary to produce nators for computing death rates. Multiple-race data were collected in 2009 by the 30 states and the District of Columbia that used the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death in a manner that is consistent with the population data collected in the 2000 census. Four additional statesŠHawaii, Maine, Minnesota, and WisconsinŠthat used the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death also reported multiple-race data. The remaining 16 states did not collect multiple-race data in 2009. In order to produce national death rates for 2008 and 2009 for this report, multiple-race data from death certificates were ‚‚bridged™™
 to be sistent with the 1977 Office
 of Management and Budget (OMB) single-race categories (17); that is, the multiple-race categories were bridged back to single-race categories. In addition, data for Asian and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) persons were reported as the combined category API (18). The populations used to calculate death rates are also bridged to single-race categories. These lations are produced under a collaborative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau and are based on year 2000 census counts. The procedures used to produce the bridged populations are described in separate publications (19,20). As the remaining 16 reporting areas gradually begin to collect data on race according to the 1997 OMB standards (21), use of the bridged populations is expected to be discontinued. Note that the population data used to compile the death rates by race shown in this report are based on special estimation procedures. They are not true counts. The estimation procedures used to develop these populations are subject to error.
 Smaller population groups are affected
 much more than larger populations by this measurement error,
 especially the AIAN population (19). Previous preliminary death reports have compared preliminary data from the current data year with final data from the previous year (1Œ13). Because the final data for 2008 are not yet available, all comparisons in this report are between the 2008 preliminary data (22) and the 2009 preliminary data. Results Trends
 in numbers and rates The preliminary number of deaths in the United States for 2009 was 2,436,682 (Tables
 A and 1). The crude death rate of 793.7 per 100,000 population was 2.4 percent less than the rate of 813.3 per 100,000 in 2008. The estimated age-adjusted death rate, which accounts for changes in the age distribution of the population, reached a record low of 741.0 per 100,000 U.S. standard population, 2.3 percent lower than the 2008 rate of 758.7 (Tables
 A and 1) (22). Figure 1 illustrates the general pattern of decline in both crude and age-adjusted death rates from 1980 through 2009. The age-adjusted death rate decreased from 2008 to 2009 by 2.8 percent for females and 1.4 percent for males. The relative magnitudes of significant changes in age-adjusted death rates by sex, race, and Hispanic origin (Table
 1)are:

Crude and age-adjusted death rates: United States, 1980Œ2007 final and 2008Œ2009 preliminary + Hispanic malesŠ2.6 percent decrease + Hispanic femalesŠ3.3 percent decrease Among the major race and Hispanic origin groups, the lowest mortality was reported for the API, Hispanic, and AIAN populations. Compared with the non-Hispanic white population, preliminary age-adjusted death rates were 44.5 percent lower for the API population, 30.3 percent lower for the Hispanic population, and 19.0 percent lower for the AIAN population. In contrast, the age-adjusted death rate for the non-Hispanic black population was 26.6 percent higher than that for the non-Hispanic white population (Table
 1). It is important to keep in mind, however,
 that mortality for races other than white and black may be seriously understated in some cases due to underreporting for some race groups and Hispanic origin on death certificates (23Œ25). Statistically significant decreases in mortality from 2008 to 2009 were registered for those under age 1 year,
 1Œ4 years, 15Œ24 years, and across age groups ranging from age 55 through 84 years. Other age groups did not experience significant change. The magnitude of the significant changes in mortality by age group is (Table

 shown above is based on a population estimate and is different
 from the infant mortality rate, which is based on live births (see ‚‚Infant
 mortality™™).
 Preliminary life expectancy data shown in this report for the 2008 data year have been updated and may differ
 from those previously published (see ‚‚Life
 Tables™™
 in ‚‚Technical
 Notes™™).
 Life expectancy data shown in this report for data years 2008Œ2009 are based on odology that was revised in 2000. The revised methodology is similar to that developed for the 1999Œ2001 decennial life tables; see ‚‚T
nical Notes.™™
 The preliminary estimate of life expectancy at birth for the total population in 2009 is 78.2 years. This represents an increase in life expectancy of 0.2 year relative to 2008 (Tables
 A and 6). Life expectancy for males increased 0.2 year,
 from 75.5 in 2008 to 75.7 in 2009. Female life expectancy increased from 80.5 to 80.6. The  4 National Vital
 Statistics Reports, Vol.
 59, No. 4, March 16, 2011
 ference between male and female life expectancy at birth has been generally decreasing since its peak of 7.8 years in 1979 (26). The gap between male and female life expectancy was 4.9 years in 2009. The difference
 in life expectancy between the white and black populations in 2009 was 4.3 years, a 0.2-year increase from the 2008 gap between the two races (22). White females have the highest life expectancy (Figure 2), lowed by,
 in order,
 black females, white males, and black males. Figure 2 also shows that this pattern has not changed from 1975 through 2009, even though life expectancy for all groups has generally increased over this time period. By state of residence, Hawaii had the lowest mortality in 2009 with an age-adjusted death rate of 619.8 deaths per 100,000 standard population (Table
 3). Mortality was highest in West
 Virginia,
 with an age-adjusted death rate of 949.6 per 100,000 standard population. Causes of death The 15 leading causes of death in 2009 remained the same as in 2008, with the exception of two causes that exchanged ranks. Intentional self-harm (suicide), the 11th
 leading cause of death in 2008, became the 10th leading cause of death in 2009, whereas Septicemia, the 10th leading cause in 2008, became the 11th
 leading cause of death in 2009. The 15 leading causes of death in 2009 (Table
 B) were: 1. Diseases of heart 2. Malignant neoplasms 3. Chronic lower respiratory diseases 4. Cerebrovascular diseases 5. Accidents (unintentional injuries) 6. Alzheimer™s

 age-adjusted death rate for the leading cause of death, Diseases of heart, decreased by 3.7 percent. The age-adjusted death rate for Malignant neoplasms decreased by 1.1 percent (Tables
 B and 2). Deaths from these two diseases combined accounted for 48 percent of deaths in the United States in 2009. Although heart disease mortality has exhibited a downward trend since 1950, cancer mortality began to decline only in the early 1990s (10,22). The preliminary age-adjusted death rate also decreased significantly for Chronic lower respiratory diseases (4.1 percent) and Cerebrovascular diseases (4.2 percent). Other leading causes of death that showed significant decreases in 2009 relative to 2008 were: Accidents (unintentional injuries) (4.1 percent), Alzheimer™s disease (4.1 percent), Diabetes mellitus (4.1 percent), Influenza and pneumonia (4.7 percent), Septicemia (1.8 percent), and Assault (homicide) (6.8 percent). The observed increase in the age-adjusted death rate for tional self-harm (suicide) was not significant. The age-adjusted death rates for Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis; Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis; Essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease; and Parkinson™s disease remained unchanged from 2008 to 2009. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease was not among the 15 leading causes of death in 2009. The preliminary age-adjusted death rate for HIV disease declined by 9.1 percent from 2008 to 2009 (Table
 2). Following a period of increase from 1987 through 1994, HIV disease mortality reached a plateau in 1995. Subsequently,
 the rate for this disease decreased an average of 33.0 percent per year from 1995 through 1998 (27), and 5.1 percent per year from 1999 through 2008 (22). For all races combined in the age group 15Œ24, HIV disease was the 12th leading cause of death in 2009, decreasing by two positions relative to its rank as 10th leading cause for those aged 15Œ24 in 2008. HIV disease remained the sixth leading cause of death for the age group 25Œ44, unchanged in rank from 2008. Among decedents aged 45Œ64, HIV disease dropped from 12th leading cause in 2008 to 13th leading cause. Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)Ša nantly antibiotic-associated inflammation of the intestines caused by C. difficile, a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacillusŠis of growing concern. The disease is often acquired by long-term patients or residents in hospitals or other health-care facilities and accounted for an increasing number of deaths between 1999 and 2008 (28,29). In 1999, 793 deaths were due to C. difficile compared with 7,483 C. difficile deaths in 2008 (22). In 2009, the number of deaths decreased to 7,285. The age-adjusted death rate for this cause decreased from 2.3 deaths per 100,000 standard population in 2008 to 2.2 deaths per 100,000 standard population in 2009 (4.3 percent). In 2009, C. difficile ranked as the 19th leading cause of death for the population aged 65 and over.
 Approximately 92 percent of deaths from C. difficile occurred to people aged 65 and over (data not shown). The preliminary age-adjusted death rate for drug-induced deaths declined by 1.6 percent, from 12.3 in 2008 to 12.1 in 2009. However,
 the final number of drug-induced deaths in 2008 or 2009 may be substantially higher because information on cause of death in these cases is often delayed pending investigation. Additional information  6 National Vital
 Statistics Reports, Vol.
 59, No. 4, March 16, 2011
 based on toxicology or autopsy reports is often not available in the preliminary file. The age-adjusted death rate for injury at work declined 10.5 percent, from 1.9 to 1.7. The observed decrease in the age-adjusted death rate for alcohol-induced deaths (1.4 percent) was not significant. Mortality from firearm injuries (Table
 2) decreased by 2.9 percent. Infant mortality The preliminary infant mortality rate for 2009 was 6.42 infant deaths per 1,000 live births (Tables
 A and 4). This represents a decrease of 2.6 percent from the preliminary 2008 rate of 6.59. With the exception of 2002 and 2005, the infant mortality rate has statistically remained the same or decreased significantly each successive year from 1958 through 2009 (22,30). The neonatal (i.e., infants aged less than 28 days) mortality rate decreased 1.9 percent from 4.27 per 1,000 live births in 2008 to 4.19 per 1,000 live births in 2009, but the decrease was not significant. The postneonatal (i.e., infants aged 28 daysŒ11
 months) mortality rate decreased by 3.4 percent between 2008 and 2009. The 2009 preliminary infant mortality rate for black infants was 12.71 infant deaths per 1,000 live births compared with 12.68 per 1,000 live births in 2008, but the observed increase was not significant. The infant mortality rate for white infants decreased in 2009 by 4.0 percent, from 5.54 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2008 to 5.32 in 2009. The mortality rate for black infants was 2.4 times the rate for white infants (Tables
 A and 4). Because of inconsistencies in the reporting of race groups on birth and death certificates, especially for races other than white and black and for Hispanic origin, infant mortality rates for these groups are likely to be underestimated (25). The linked birth/infant death data set provides a better source of data for infant deaths and mortality rates by maternal race and ethnicity (31). Although the infant mortality rate is the preferred indicator of the risk of dying during the first year of life, the infant death rate is also shown in this report. While similar,
 these two rates vary based on differences
 in their denominators. The denominator of the 2009 infant death rate is the estimated population under age 1 year as of the reference date, July 1, 2009 (14). This population estimate includes a combination of infants born in 2008 who had not reached their first birthday before July 1, 2009, and infants born in 2009 before July 1, 2009. In contrast, the denominator of the 2009 infant mortality rate is all live births occurring during 2009 (32). For example, the preliminary number of live births for 2009 (n = 4,131,019) is 3.1 percent lower than the midyear infant population in 2009 (n = 4,261,494). Therefore, the infant mortality rate for 2009 (642.1 deaths per 100,000 live births) is higher than the infant death rate for 2009 (622.6 deaths per 100,000 population). For 2009, both the infant mortality rate and the infant death rate decreased significantly from 2008. The 10 leading causes of infant mortality for 2009 were: 1. Congenital malformations,deformations and chromosomal abnormalities 2. Disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified 3. Sudden infant death syndrome 4. Newborn affected
 by maternal complications of pregnancy 5. Accidents (unintentional injuries) 6. Newborn affected
 by complications of placenta, cord and membranes 7. Bacterial sepsis of newborn 8. Respiratory distress of newborn 9. Diseases of the circulatory system 10. Neonatal hemorrhage There were no differences
 in ranking among the leading causes of infant death between 2008 (22) and 2009 (Table
 8). The infant mortality rate decreased for 2 of 10 leading causes of death from 2008 to 2009 (Tables
 5 and 8). The infant mortality rate for Newborn affected
 by maternal complications of pregnancy Šthe fourth leading cause of deathŠdecreased by 7.5 percent (Tables
 5 and 8). The infant mortality rate for Accidents (unintentional injuries)Šthe fifth leading cause of deathŠ decreased by 8.5 percent. Deaths due to SIDS, currently the third leading cause of infant death, have been declining since 1988 (4,22). The observed decrease in SIDS from 53.9 to 52.5 is not statistically significant. Because SIDS deaths often involve lengthy investigations, the mortality rate due to SIDS is typically lower based on preliminary data than that based on the final data. Recent declines in mortality due to SIDS also may reflect primarily a change in the way SIDS is diagnosed and reported by medical examiners and coroners (33).

 1. Deaths and death rates by age, sex, and race and Hispanic origin, and age-adjusted death rates, by sex and race and Hispanic origin: United States, preliminary 2008 and 2009ŠCon. [Data are based on a continuous file of records received from the states. Age-specific rates are per 100,000 population in specified group. Age-adjusted
 rates are per 100,000 U.S. standard population; see ‚‚Technical
 Notes.™™
 Figures are based on weighted data rounded to the nearest individual, so categories may not
 add to totals. Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the death certificate. Data for Hispanic origin and specified races other than white and black should be
 interpreted with caution because of inconsistencies between reporting Hispanic origin and race on death certificates and on censuses and surveys; see ‚‚Technical
 Notes.™™
 Race
 categories are consistent with 1977 Office
 of Management and Budget (OMB) standards. Multiple-race data were reported by 34 states and the District of Columbia in 2009
 and 2008; see ‚‚Technical
 Notes.™™
 The multiple-race data for these states were bridged to the single-race categories of the 1977 OMB standards for comparability with other states; see ‚‚Technical

NOTES: For certain causes of death such as unintentional injuries, homicides, suicides, and respiratory diseases, preliminary and final data differ
 because of the truncated nature of the preliminary file. Data are subject to sampling or random variation. For information regarding the calculation of standard errors and further discussion of variability of the data, see ‚‚Technical

 Although the infant
 mortality rate is the preferred indicator of the risk of dying during the first year of life, another measure of infant mortality,
 the infant death rate, is shown elsewhere in this report. The two measures typically are similar but use different
 denominators. For more information on these measures of risk, see ‚‚Infant

 33 Technical
 Notes Nature and sources of data Preliminary mortality data for 2009 are based on a continuous receipt and processing of statistical records by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention™s
 (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through November 5, 2010. NCHS received the data from the states™ vital registration systems through the Vital
 Statistics Cooperative Program. Demographic information for the United States was available in calendar year 2009 for an estimated 97.4 percent of infant decedents and 98.5 percent of decedents aged 1 year and over.
 Medical information for the United States was available in calendar year 2009 for an estimated 94.3 percent of infant decedents and 96.5 percent of decedents aged 1 year and over.
 In this report, U.S. totals include only events occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data for Puerto Rico, Virgin
 Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Marianas included in tables showing data by state are not included in U.S. totals. Information on reporting for the 2008 preliminary data are available elsewhere (22). For 2009, individual records of infant deaths (deaths under age 1 year) and deaths of persons aged 1 year and over are weighted (when necessary) to independent counts of deaths occurring in each state. These state-specific counts serve as control totals and are the basis for the record weights in the preliminary file. If the number of records in the preliminary file is greater than the count received from the state, the state-specific number of records in the preliminary file is used instead and the weight is set at 1.0. For this report, two separate files are processed. The medical file, or cause-of-death file, contains records that include both demographic and medical information used to generate tables showing cause of death. The demographic file, which includes records from the medical file as well as additional records containing demographic information only,
 is used to generate tables showing mortality by demographic characteristics only.
 A state-specific weight is computed for each file by dividing the state control total by the number of records in the pre˜liminary sample. Each record is assigned two weights, a state-specific weight and a U.S. weight. State weights are used for state-specific tabulations and U.S. weights are used for national tabulations. For the medical file, the state weight makes the death counts comparable with those in the demographic file. The U.S. weight combines two factors: one to make the medical file counts for the individual record™s state comparable with those for the demographic file, and one to compensate for any states not represented in the file. This second factor is equivalent to zero if all states are represented in the file. Thus, when all states are rep˜resented in the preliminary files, the state and U.S. weights are the same. Because there are two separate files, each with two separate sets of weights, slight inconsistencies may occur between the demographic and medical tables in this report. Table
 I shows the percent complete˜ness of the preliminary files by place of occurrence for the United States and each state. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of records in the preliminary files by the control total and multiplying by 100. Although data by place of occurrence are used to compute the weights, all data in this report are tabulated by place of residence. Based on a criterion of at least 75 percent completeness of a state™s demographic file for the 12-month period as a basis for providing state-specific estimates, the demographic mortality files for 2009 contained less than 71.1 percent of their records for Georgia (Table
 I); therefore, data for Georgia are included in the U.S. total but are not shown separately in Table
 3, which shows deaths and death rates by state. Because the preliminary 2009 data for Georgia were incomplete, additional review of the data was included to ensure that the 2009 estimates for the United States were accurate. For selected variables in the mortality files, unknown or not-stated values are imputed. The percentage not stated was less than 1.8 per˜cent for all variables discussed in this report. Detailed information on reporting completeness and imputation procedures may be found in ‚‚Technical

 (34). 2003 revision of U.S. Standard Certificate of Death Between 2008 and 2009, no changes occurred in the number of states implementing the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certifi˜cate of Death. In this report, the 30 states that implemented the 2003 revision along with the District of Columbia are: Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
 New Mexico, New York
 (including New York
 City), North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas,

 (Vermont
 implemented the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death in July 2008, so a portion of that state™s data for 2008 is based on the 1989 revision of the certificate.) The remaining 20 states collected and reported death data in 2009 based on the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death. The 2003 revision is described in detail elsewhere (15,16). Because the items presented in this report appear largely comparable despite changes to item wording and format in the 2003 revision, data from both groups of states are combined. Race and Hispanic origin The 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death allows the reporting of more than one race (multiple races) (15). This change was implemented to reflect the increasing diversity of the population of the United States, to be consistent with the decennial census, and to reflect standards issued in 1997 by the Office
 of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB standards mandate the collection of more than one race for federal data (see ‚‚Population
 denominators™™)
 (21). In addition, the new certificate is compliant with the OMB-mandated minimum set of five races to be reported for federal data. These are white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI). For 2009 mortality data, multiple races were reported on the revised death certificates of Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Dela˜ware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
 New Mexico, New York
 (including New York
 City), North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas,

 35 and Wisconsin. Data from the vital records of the remaining 16 states are based on the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death, which follows the 1977 OMB standards, allowing only a single race to be reported (16,17). In addition, these 16 states report a minimum set of four races as stipulated in the 1977 standards. These are white, black orAfrican
 American, AIAN, andAsian
 or Pacific Islander (API). In order to provide uniformity and comparability of data during the transition period, before all or most of the data becomes available in the new multiple-race format, it is necessary to adjust the data for those states reporting multiple race by ‚‚bridging™™
 the multiple-race informa˜tion reported for decedents to a single race. The bridging procedure used for mortality numerators is similar to the procedure used to bridge multiracial population estimates (see ‚‚Population
 denominators™™)
 (19,20). Multiracial decedents are imputed to a single race (white, black, AIAN, or API) according to the combination of races, Hispanic origin, sex, and age indicated on the death certificate. The imputation pro˜cedure is described in detail at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs
/ Multiple_race_docu_5-10-04.pdf. Because race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the death certificate, data shown by race include persons of Hispanic or non-Hispanic origin, and data for Hispanic origin include persons of any race. In this report, unless otherwise specified, deaths of persons of Hispanic origin are included in the totals for each race groupŠwhite, black, AIAN, and APIŠaccording to the decedent™s race as reported on the death certificate. Data shown for Hispanic persons include all persons of Hispanic origin of any race. Mortality data on the Hispanic origin population are based on deaths in all states. Death rates for Hispanic, AIAN, and API persons should be interpreted with caution because of inconsistencies in reporting race on death certificates compared with such reporting on censuses, surveys, and birth cer˜tificates. Studies have shown underreporting on death certificates of AIAN, API, and Hispanic decedents, as well as undercounts of these groups in censuses (23Œ25). Injury at work Information on deaths attributed to injuries at work is derived from a separate item on the death certificate that asks the medical certifier whether the death resulted from an injury sustained at work. The item is on the death certificate of all states. Number of deaths, crude death rates, and age-adjusted death rates for injury at work for those aged 15 and over,
 excluding age not stated, are shown in Table
 2. Age-adjusted death rates presented in this report for injury at work were computed using age-specific death rates and the U.S. standard population based on the year 2000 standard for ages 15 and over,
 excluding age not stated (Table
 V). If the estimated ‚‚employed™™
 population aged 15 and over had been used instead in the denominator,
 higher death rates would have resulted, especially for population groups with lower employment rates (see ‚‚Computing
 rates and percentages™™).
 Cause-of-death classification Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World
 Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that member nations classify and code causes of death in accordance with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, and Related Health Problems (ICD). The ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury,
 and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on the use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines, which are described in annual issues of part 2a of the ‚‚NCHS
 Instruction Manual™™
 (35). Effective
 with deaths occurring in 1999, the United States began using the Tenth
 Revision of the ICD, or ICDŒ10 (36). In 2004, the Second Edition of ICDŒ10 was adopted (37). During 1979Œ1998, causes of death were coded and classified according to the Ninth Revision (ICDŒ9) (38). The change from ICDŒ9 to ICDŒ10 resulted in discontinuities for selected cause-of-death trends. These discontinui˜ties are measured using comparability ratios derived from a compa˜rability study (39). Beginning with data for 2001, NCHS introduced categories *U01Œ*U03 for classifying and coding deaths due to acts of terrorism. The asterisks before the category codes indicate that they are not part of ICDŒ10. Deaths classified to the terrorism categories are included in the categories Assault (homicide) and Intentional self-harm (suicide) for the 113
 causes-of-death list (Table
 2) and Assault (homicide) in the 130 causes-of-infant death list (Table
 5). Additional information on the new terrorism categories can be found at http://www.cdc
. gov/nchs/icd/terrorism_code.htm. No deaths occurring in 2008 and 2009 were classified to the terrorism categories. Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)ŠDue to growing concerns about the number of deaths from Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile (ICDŒ10 code A04.7), beginning in 2006, C. difficile deaths are included separately as a rankable cause of death in tables showing data for 113
 selected causes of death (Table
 2). The number of deaths due to this cause decreased by 2.6 percent from 7,483 in 2008 to 7,285 in 2009. The age-adjusted death rate for this cause decreased significantly (by 4.3 percent) from 2.3 per 100,000 standard population in 2008 to 2.2 in 2009. Codes for drug-induced deathsŠThe list of codes included in drug-induced causes was expanded in data year 2003 to be more comprehensive. The following 37 ICDŒ10 codes were added to the previous list of drug-induced codes: D52.1, D59.0, D59.2, D61.1, D64.2, E06.4, E16.0, E23.1, E24.2 , E27.3, E66.1, G21.1, G24.0, G25.1, G25.4, G25.6, G44.4, G62.0, G72.0, I95.2, J70.2, J70.3, J70.4, L10.5, L27.0, L27.1, M10.2, M32.0, M80.4, M81.4, M83.5, M87.1, R78.1, R78.2, R78.3, R78.4, and R78.5. In addition to expansion of the list in 2003, ICD codes K85.3 (Drug-induced acute pancreatitis) and R50.2 (Drug-induced fever) were added to the list of drug-induced codes in 2006. Two
 deaths were assigned to K85.3 in 2008; no deaths were classified to these two new codes in 2009. Codes for alcohol-induced deathsŠThe list of codes included in alcohol-induced causes was expanded in data year 2003 to be more comprehensive. Three ICDŒ10 codes were added to the previous list of alcohol-induced codes: E24.4, G72.1, and K86.0. Additionally,
 K85.2 (Alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis) was added to the list in 2006. In 2008, 405 deaths were classified to K85.2; in 2009, 400 deaths were classified to K85.2.  36 National Vital
 Statistics Reports, Vol.
 59, No. 4, March 16, 2011
 Recently added codesŠBeginning with data for 2009, NCHS added five new WHO ICDŒ10 codes: A09.0, Other and unspecified gastroenteritis and colitis of infectious origin; A09.9, Gastroenteritis and colitis of unspecified origin; K52.3, Indeterminate colitis; R26.3, Immo˜bility; and R63.6, Insufficient
 intake of food and water due to self neglect. Deaths classified to codes A09.0 and A09.9 are included in the category Certain other intestinal infections in the list of 113
 selected causes of death (Table
 2) and in the category Diarrhea and gastro˜enteritis of infectious origin in the list of 130 selected causes of infant death (Table
 5). Deaths classified to the code K52.3 are included in the Residual category of the list of 113
 selected causes of death and in the category Gastritis, duodenitis, and noninfective enteritis and colitis in the list of 130 selected causes of infant death. Deaths classified to codes R26.3 and R63.6 are included in the category Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified in both the 113
 and 130 cause lists. Additional information on these new categories is available from: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/
 Part9InstructionManual2009.pdf (39). In 2009, ICDŒ10 code A09 was expanded from a three-digit code to two four-digit codes (A09.0 and A09.9). This expansion allowed for greater specificity,
 resulting in an increase in the number of deaths classified to A09. This directly affected
 the category Certain other intestinal infections in the list of 113
 selected causes of death in Table
 2 (7,883 deaths in 2008 compared with 10,242 deaths in 2009) and the category Diarrhea and gastroenteritis of infectious origin in the list of 130 selected causes of infant death in Table
 5 (no deaths in 2008 compared with 328 deaths in 2009). The effect
 of this change will be examined with final data. In 2009, the title for ICDŒ10 code J09 was changed from Influenza due to identified avian influenza virus to Influenza due to certain identified influenza virus. The reason for this change was to accom˜modate deaths from influenza A (H1N1) virus in code J09 for the 2009 data year.
 In April 2009, the new influenza A (H1N1) virus was deter˜mined to be a cause of influenza illness in the United States (40). In 2009, 1,486 deaths were classified to code J09. Nonsampling error Causes of death in this report are subject to nonsampling error because the preliminary file is processed before a full year™s worth of data is available. The file is thus subject to the seasonality of certain causes of death that may not be equally distributed throughout the year.
 It is known, for example, that external causes such as unintentional injuries occur disproportionately during the summer months and that fatal respiratory conditions are more prevalent during the winter months. Accordingly,
 the truncated nature of the prelimi˜nary file may systematically overemphasize or underemphasize causes with pronounced seasonality,
 particularly when these deaths cluster at the end of the year.
 However,
 in years where the preliminary file completeness is more than 90 percent, it is unlikely that seasonality is a major factor.
 Furthermore, for some deaths, especially those subject to medi˜colegal investigation such as unintentional injuries, homicides, suicides, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the final cause may not be available at the time the preliminary file is processed. In those cases, the causes of death may be reported in the preliminary file as unknown or pending investigation and coded to the category Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality (ICDŒ10 code R99), a subcategory of Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified (ICDŒ10 codes R00ŒR99). In the final data, some of the deaths of unknown cause in the preliminary file will be reassigned to specific causes if further,
 more specific cause-of-death information is provided. A quantitative assessment of the degree of the nonsampling error can be made by comparing final data and preliminary data for the same year.
 A comparison of such data for the selected 113
 causes of death for the total U.S. population for 2005Œ2007 indicates that preliminary estimates for some causes of death are sometimes underestimated and sometimes overestimated in the preliminary file (Table
 II). Thus, the number of deaths for unintentional injuries was underestimated in the preliminary file by 2.5 percent in 2005, 3.2 percent in 2006, and 5.4 per˜cent in 2007. Similar undercounts occurred for suicide with preliminary underestimates of 2.7 percent in 2005, 3.3 percent in 2006, and 4.1 percent in 2007; and for homicide, which showed a 2.4 percent underestimate in the preliminary file in 2005, 2.9 percent in 2006, and 4.6 percent in 2007. Comparisons showing nonsampling error in preliminary estimates for causes of infant death are shown in Table
 III, where Disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified (P07) was underestimated by 0.1 percent in 2005, overestimated by 0.1 percent in 2006, and underestimated by 3.6 percent in 2007. Unin˜tentional injuries (V01ŒX59) and SIDS (R95) were underestimated in the preliminary data for each of the three years from 2005 through 2007, with unintentional injuries being underestimated between 1.3 percent and 3.7 percent, and SIDS between 5.5 percent and 13.7 percent (Table
 III). Tabulation
 lists and cause-of-death ranking Tabulation
 lists for ICDŒ10 are published in the ‚‚NCHS
 Instruc˜tion Manual, Part 9, ICDŒ10 Cause-of-Death Lists for Tabulating
 Mortality Statistics, Updated March 2009™™
 (41). For this report, two tabulation lists are used: the List of 113
 Selected Causes of Death used for deaths of all ages, and the List of 130 Selected Causes of Infant Death used for infants. Modifications in the lists reflecting changes in ICD codes are footnoted in the report tables. These lists are also used to rank leading causes of death for the two population groups (42). For the List of 113
 Selected Causes of Death, the group titles Major cardiovascular diseases (ICDŒ10 codes I00ŒI78) and Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified (ICDŒ10 codes R00ŒR99) are not ranked. In addition, category titles that begin with the words ‚‚Other™™
 and ‚‚All
 other™™
 are not ranked to determine the leading causes of death. When one of the titles that represents a subtotal is ranked [for example, Tuberculosis
 (ICDŒ10 codes A16ŒA19)], its component parts are not ranked [in this case, Respiratory tuberculosis (ICDŒ10 code A16) and Other tuberculosis (ICDŒ10 codes A17ŒA19)]. For the List of 130 Selected Causes of Infant Death, the same ranking procedures are used, except that the category Major cardiovascular diseases is not on the list. Infant mortality The infant mortality rate is the most commonly used index for measuring the risk of dying during the first year of life. The rates  Table

 presented in this report are calculated by dividing the preliminary number of infant deaths that occurred during 2009 by the number of live births for the same period and are presented as rates per 1,000 or per 100,000 live births. For preliminary birth figures used in the denominator for infant mortality rates, see ‚‚Births:
 Preliminary Data for 2009™™
 (32). In contrast to infant mortality rates based on live births, infant death rates are based on the estimated population under age 1 year (Table
 1). Infant death rates that appear in tabulations of age-specific death rates in this report are calculated by dividing the number of infant deaths in 2009 by the estimated population of persons under age 1 on July 1, 2009, and are presented as rates per 100,000 population in this age group. Because of differences
 in their denominators, infant death rates may differ
 from infant mortality rates. Information on infant deaths can also be obtained from a file where the infant™s death certificate is linked to the birth certificate. The linked birth/infant death data set (linked file) is a better source of data for infant deaths and mortality rates by race and ethnicity because the race of the mother as reported by the mother on the birth certificate is used in both the numerator and denominator of the infant mortality rate. In contrast, for infant deaths and mortality rates in this report, race information for the denominator is the race of the mother as reported on the birth certificate, but the race information for the numerator is the race of the infant decedent as reported on the death certificate. Race information reported on the birth certificate is considered to be more accurate than that on the death certificate, because the race of each parent is usually reported on the birth certificate by the mother at the time of delivery,
 whereas on the death certificate, the race of the deceased infant is reported by the funeral director based on information provided by an informant or by observation. This difference
 in the method of reporting race data has a larger impact for races other than white and black and can lead to differences
 in race-specific infant mortality rates between the two data sources (31). Life tables The period life table provides a measure of the effect
 of current mortality on life expectancy.
 It is composed of sets of values showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime to the age-specific death rates of a particular time period, usually a given year.
 Beginning with final data reported for 1997, the life table methodology was changed from previous annual reports. Previously,
 U.S. life tables were abridged and constructed by reference to a standard table (43). In addition, the age range for these life tables was limited to 5-year age groups ending with the age group 85 and over.
 For 1997Œ1999 mortality data, a revised life table methodology was used to construct complete life tables by single years of age that extend to age 100 (44) using a methodology similar to that of the decennial life tables (45). The advantages of the new methodology over the previous methodology are its comparability with decennial life table methodology,
 greater accuracy,
 and greater age detail. A comparison of the two methods shows small differences
 in resulting values for life expectancy (44). Although the new method produces complete life tables, that is, life tables by single years of age, life table data shown in this report are summarized in 5-year age groupings. To
 calculate the probability of dying at each age, the revised methodology uses vital statistics death rates for ages under 85 and mortality data from the Medicare program for ages 85 and over.
 Medicare data were used to model the probability of dying at ages 85 and over because the data on decedents™ age are shown to be significantly more reliable than vital statistics data at the oldest ages (46). The methodology for constructing life tables was revised once more starting with mortality data for the year 2000. Life table data shown in this report for 2008 and 2009 (Table
 6) are based on this revised methodology.
 Complete life tables by single years of age that extend to age 100 were constructed using a methodology similar to that developed for the 1999Œ2001 decennial life tables (47). To
 calculate the probability of dying at each age, two major changes were made to the methodology: 1) Probabilities for ages 66Œ100 were based on blended vital statistics and Medicare probabilities of dying (probabilities of death for ages 65 and under were based on vital statistics data as before); and 2) Smoothing and extrapolation of death rates for ages 66Œ100 was performed using a mathematical model (47). In the previous method, Medicare probabilities were modeled for ages 85 and over; no blending or smoothing was done. The newly revised methodology,
 along with a more comprehensive description of the methodology,
 was published in ‚‚United
 States Life Tables,
 2005™™
 (48). The life expectancy data shown in this report for the 2008 data year have been updated and may differ
 from those published in ‚‚Deaths:
 Preliminary Data for 2008™™
 (22). The data were updated due to an error found in the original population data during tabulation of the life tables for the 2008 report. Population denominators The rates in this report use population estimates based on the 2000 census and are estimated as of July 1, 2008, and July 1, 2009. These population estimates are available on the NCHS website (14,49). The population estimates have been produced under a collab˜orative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau and are based on the 2000 census counts. Reflecting the new standards issued in 1997 by OMB, the 2000 census included an option for persons to report more than one race as appropriate for themselves and household members (21). In addition, the 1997 OMB standards called for reporting of Asian persons separately from NHOPI. In the 1977 OMB standards, data for API persons were collected as a single group (17). Death certificates for 16 states currently collect only one race in the same categories as specified in the 1977 OMB standards (see ‚‚2003
 revision of U.S. Standard Certificate of Death™™).
 In addition, those death certificate data do not report Asians separately from NHOPI. Thus, for nearly one-third of the states, the death certificate data by race (numerators for death rates) are incompatible with population data collected in the 2000 census (denominators for the rates). In order to produce national death rates for 2008 and 2009, the reported population data for multiple-race persons had to be ‚‚bridged™™
 back to single-race categories. In addition, the census counts were modified to be consistent with the 1977 OMB racial categories, that is, to report the data for Asian persons and NHOPI as one combined category,
 API, and to reflect age as of the census reference date. The procedures used to produce the bridged populations are described in separate publications (19,20). Bridged data are anticipated to be used over the next few years for computing population-based rates. As more states collect data on race according to the 1997 OMB standards (21), use of the bridged populations is expected to be discontinued.  PsiR = RiPs i OComputing rates and percentages Death rates are on an annual basis per 100,000 estimated population residing in the specified area. Infant mortality rates are per 1,000 or per 100,000 live births. Age-adjusted death rates (R) are used to compare relative mor˜tality risks among groups and over time. However,
 they should be viewed as relative indexes rather than as actual measures of mortality risk. They were computed by the direct method, that is, by applying age-specific death rates (Ri) to the U.S. standard population (relative age distribution of year 2000 projected population of the United States); see the following formula for age-adjusted death rate, and the table of U.S. standard population (Table
 IV). Table

 VI. Effective
 with 1999 data, the standard population was changed from 1940 to the year 2000 population in accordance with the new statistical policy promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in August 1998 (50). The new population standard affects
 levels of mortality and, to some extent, trends and group comparisons. Of particular note are the effects
 on race comparison of mortality; see ‚‚Age
 Standardization of Death Rates: Implementation of the Year
 2000 Standard™™
 (50). Beginning with 2003 data, the traditional standard million population along with corresponding standard weights to six decimal places were replaced by the projected year 2000 population age distribution. The effect
 of the change is negligible and does not significantly affect
 comparability with age-adjusted rates calculated using the previous method. Death rates for the Hispanic population are based only on events to persons reported as Hispanic. Rates for non-Hispanic white persons are based on the sum of all events to white decedents reported as non-Hispanic and white decedents with origin not stated. Similarly,
 rates for non-Hispanic black persons are based on the sum of all events to black decedents reported as non-Hispanic and black decedents with origin not stated. Hispanic origin is not imputed if it is not reported. For calculating death rates, deaths with age not stated are not distributed. The number of deaths with age not stated in 2009 was 315, approxi˜mately 0.01 percent of all deaths. For statistics shown in tables throughout this report, an asterisk (*) indicates that the figure does not meet standards of reliability or precision. In this report two sets of criteria determine whether a figure meets these standards: +Reporting for any particular variable is at least 80 percent com˜plete. In this report, no data were suppressed based on this criterion. +A rate or percentage is based on at least 20 deaths. Rates based on fewer than 20 deaths have a relative standard error (RSE) of about 23 percent or more and, therefore, are considered highly variable. For age-adjusted death rates, this criterion is applied to the sum of the age-specific deaths. However,
 some death rates (based on data files that are less than 100 percent complete and on 20Œ31 deaths) may have RSEs of 23 percent or more but are still shown instead of asterisks. As a result, caution should be exercised in analyzing rates based on 20Œ31 events. Additional  Œ1 (1 Œ f)(NŒ X)1. RSE=100

 information on random variation in numbers of events, rates, ratios, and percentages may be found in ‚‚Reliability
 of estimates.™™
 Reliability of estimates Because the preliminary estimates of deaths in this report are based on files that may not be complete, they are subject to sampling variability.
 This concept is reflected in the fact that record weights are used to adjust record counts to independent control totals. The lack of completeness of the vital statistics files is due to delays in receiving and processing the death records. Although the proportion of records making up the preliminary file does not constitute a veritable random sample, for the sake of convenience the variability associated with this error (sampling variability) is treated as if it were from a random sample. Even where the number of vital events in this report is 100 percent complete and not subject to sampling variability,
 it might be affected
 by random variation. Thus, when the number of events is small and the probability of such an event is small, considerable caution must be observed in interpreting the data. Such infrequent events may be assumed to follow a Poisson probability distribution. The first column of Table
 VII shows the estimated RSEs of a file that is nearly 100 per˜cent complete. Data in a file that is less than 100 percent complete are affected
 by sampling variation as well as by random variation. The estimated RSEs in columns 2Œ6 of Table
 VII for various levels of file completeness are measures of the sampling errors and the random errors of the estimates. They do not include nonsampling error.
 The estimated RSEs in Table
 VII were computed using this formula: where f =˛= sampling fraction or percent of file completeness/100 from Table
 I. For mortality data based on deaths under age 1 year,
 use f for ‚‚infant
 deaths™™
 for either the demographic or medical file as appropriate. For mortality data based on all ages combined or any age group that is 1 year and over,
 use f for ‚‚deaths
 1 year of age and over™™
 for either the demographic or medical files as appropriate. X =˛ estimated number of infant deaths or deaths. N =˛ total count of infant deaths or deaths for the United States or any state. (NOTE: RSEs shown in Table
 VII are based on N = 4,000,000. If N is smaller,
 RSEs may be slightly smaller than those shown.) Table

 number of deaths. For rates based on population estimates in the denominator,

 for 85 years and over.
 Ri = age-specific rate for the ith age group. wi = ith age-specific U.S. standard population such that wi = 1.000000 (see ‚‚Computing
 rates and percentages™™).
 Xi = estimated number of deaths for the ith age group. Ni = total count of deaths from Table
 I for each ith age group (for infant deaths, use the count of records as shown; for all age groups 1Œ4 through 85 years and over,
 use the count of records as shown for deaths at ages 1 year and over). fi = percentage of file completeness/100 from Table
 I (for infant deaths, use the percent completeness for the demographic or medical file as appropriate for deaths under age 1 year; for all age groups 1Œ4 through 85 years and over,
 use the percent completeness for the demographic or medical file as appropriate for deaths at ages 1 year and over). For testing the equality of two rates, R1 and R2, the following z-test may be used to define a significance test statistic: RŒ R9ŒThe two-tailed 0.95 critical value for a z statistic is 1.96. Therefore, if ?z?  1.96, the difference
 is significant at the 0.05 level. If ?z? < 1.96, then the difference
 would be considered not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. As a hypothetical example, assume R1 is the same as the above example for the current 12-month period and that R2, 15.0, is based on 50 deaths occurring in the prior 12-month period (which implies that the file is approximately 100 percent complete for R2). The z-test may be determined as: 20.0 Œ15.0 z = =1.46

100 100 Because ?z? < 1.96, there is not a statistically significant difference
 between the two rates at the 0.05 level of significance. For rates or percentages based on denominators having random variation only or random and sampling variation, the RSE must take into account the variation in both the numerator and denominator.
 For example, for a rate, R3, based on the number of live births in the denominator,
 the RSE is computed as: Œwhere 
RSE(D) = RSE of the number of deaths, D  RSE(R3) 11.

 To
 compare the equality of two infant mortality rates or two percentages that have variation in the numerator and denominator,
 the above-mentioned z-test may be used.  National Vital
