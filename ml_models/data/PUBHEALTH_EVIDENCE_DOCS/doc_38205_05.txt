 The Truth: False reports that Bill Clinton has suffered a health crisis are based on unsourced reports appearing on an untrustworthy website known for publishing false reports.
 The story appeared at USA Politics Today on April 25, 2017, under the headline, “Bill Clinton Health Crisis — Family Gathering In Little Rock.” The story, which quickly made its way around social media and was re-reported in a video posted on YouTube, begins:Sources say Bill Clinton is in rough shape.
 .
 Sources close to the Clinton family say that Slick Willy, 40th President of the United States and perpetual cheater, will be lucky to make it through the end of the week.
 The Clinton family, including extended relatives and members of the Rodham clan, have been filing into Little Rock all week where Bill is reportedly bedridden at the residence attached to his presidential library.
 The fact that they’re booking rooms and sticking around most likely means they’re expecting to have to stay for a funeral.
 The Clintons have said that they would refuse any state burial or national ceremony if anything were to happen to them during the Trump administration as they are afraid of what he may say during the service.USA Politics Today published slew of fictional news stories during the 2016 presidential election — including this (false) claim that we looked into about Green Party candidate Jill Stein endorsing President Trump.
 The Bill Clinton health crisis story appears to be yet another fictional report.
 The first problem with the Bill Clinton health crisis report is that Clinton was not, as reported, bed-ridden in the 24-hour period before the report surfaced.
 Clinton posted a joke on his verified Twitter account making a joke about the Clinton Center being bugged while standing next to a giant bug statue on April 23rd: BREAKING: We just learned that the @ClintonCenter has been bugged.

 Clinton was still scheduled to attend the Emory University School of Law’s Centennial Event on April 29, making it very unlikely that the former president had suffered life-threatening health crisis.
