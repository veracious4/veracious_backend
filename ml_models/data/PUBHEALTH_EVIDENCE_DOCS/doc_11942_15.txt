 It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).The human body can’t get rid of HIV and no effective HIV cure exists.
 So, once you have HIV, you have it for life.However, by taking HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART), people with HIV can live long and healthy lives and prevent transmitting HIV to their sexual partners.
 In addition, there are effective methods to prevent getting HIV through sex or drug use, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).First identified in 1981, HIV is the cause of one of humanity’s deadliest and most persistent epidemics.What Is AIDS?AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the body’s immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.In the U.S., most people with HIV do not develop AIDS because taking HIV medicine every day as prescribed stops the progression of the disease.A person with HIV is considered to have progressed to AIDS when:the number of their CD4 cells falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood (200 cells/mm3).
 (In someone with a healthy immune system, CD4 counts are between 500 and 1,600 cells/mm3.)
 ORthey develop one or more opportunistic infections regardless of their CD4 count.Without HIV medicine, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years.
 Once someone has a dangerous opportunistic illness, life expectancy without treatment falls to about 1 year.
 HIV medicine can still help people at this stage of HIV infection, and it can even be lifesaving.
 But people who start ART soon after they get HIV experience more benefits—that’s why HIV testing is so important.How Do I Know If I Have HIV?The only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested.
 Testing is relatively simple.
 You can ask your health care provider for an HIV test.
 Many medical clinics, substance abuse programs, community health centers, and hospitals offer them too.
 You can also buy a home testing kit at a pharmacy or online.To find an HIV testing location near you, use the HIV Services Locator.HIV self-testing is also an option.
 Self-testing allows people to take an HIV test and find out their result in their own home or other private location.
 You can buy a self-test kit at a pharmacy or online.
 Some health departments or community-based organizations also provide self-test kits for free.Read the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) fact sheet on the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test, the only FDA-approved in-home HIV test.The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made it more difficult for some people to access traditional places where HIV testing is provided.
 Self-testing allows people to get tested for HIV while still following stay-at-home orders and social distancing practices.
 Ask your local health department or HIV service organization if they offer self-testing kits.
