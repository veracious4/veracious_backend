 On Passage of the Bill in the House.
 This was a vote to pass S. 397 (109th) in the House.
 The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) is a United States law which protects firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable when crimes have been committed with their products.
 However, both manufacturers and dealers can still be held liable for damages resulting from defective products, breach of contract, criminal misconduct, and other actions for which they are directly responsible in much the same manner that any U.S.-based manufacturer of consumer products is held responsible.
 They may also be held liable for negligent entrustment when they have reason to know a gun is intended for use in a crime.
 The PLCAA is codified at 15 U.S.C.
 §§ 7901-7903.

 The Speaker of the House is not required to vote in “ordinary legislative proceedings, except when such vote would be decisive.” In practice, this means the Speaker of the House rarely votes and only does so when it is politically useful.
 When the Speaker declines to vote, he or she is simply omitted from the roll call by the House Clerk.
 (See House Rules, Rule I(7).)
 “Aye” or “Yea”?
 “Aye” and “Yea” mean the same thing, and so do “No” and “Nay”.
 Congress uses different words in different sorts of votes.
 The U.S. Constitution says that bills should be decided on by the “yeas and nays” (Article I, Section 7).
 Congress takes this literally and uses “yea” and “nay” when voting on the final passage of bills.
 All Senate votes use these words.
 But the House of Representatives uses “Aye” and “No” in other sorts of votes.

 All Votes        Study Guide   How well do you understand this vote?
 Use this study guide to find out.
 You can find answers to most of the questions below here on the vote page.
 For a guide to understanding the bill this vote was about, see here.
 What was the procedure for this vote?
 What was this vote on?
 Not all votes are meant to pass legislation.
 In the Senate some votes are not about legislation at all, since the Senate must vote to confirm presidential nominations to certain federal positions.
 This vote is related to a bill.
 However, that doesn’t necessarily tell you what it is about.
 Congress makes many decisions in the process of passing legislation, such as on the procedures for debating the bill, whether to change the bill before voting on passage, and even whether to vote on passage at all.
 If you aren’t sure what the House was voting on, try seeing if it’s on this list.
 What is the next step after this vote?
 Take a look at where this bill is in the legislative process.
 What might come next?
 Keep in mind what this specific vote was on, and the context of the bill.
 Will there be amendments?
 Will the other chamber of Congress vote on it, or let it die?
 For this question it may help to briefly examine the bill itself.
 What is your analysis of this vote?
 What trends do you see in this vote?
 Members of Congress side together for many reasons beside being in the same political party, especially so for less prominent legislation or legislation specific to a certain region.
 What might have determined how the roll call came out in this case?
 Does it look like Members of Congress voted based on party, geography, or some other reason?
 How did your representative vote?
 There is one vote here that should be more important to you than all the others.
 These are the votes cast by your representative, which is meant to represent you and your community.
 Do you agree with how your representative voted?
 Why do you think they voted the way they did?
 If you don’t already know who your Members of Congress are you can find them by entering your address here.
 Each vote’s study guide is a little different — we automatically choose which questions to include based on the information we have available about the vote.
