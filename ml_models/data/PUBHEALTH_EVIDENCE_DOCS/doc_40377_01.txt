 Summary of eRumor:This appears to be a CNN 		Breaking News alert that says that “Mitt Romney is almost President” and 		that “more than 60 percent of votes will be in favor of Mitt Romney.”  The Truth:This is a  fake CNN alert 		that could lead computer users to a “Blackhole malware attack”, according 		to an October 11 ,2012 article by Naked Security-Sophos.
 The 		article said that the links in the email are designed to reroute web 		browsers to a site on the Internet that will infect the computer with a 		virus.
 The easiest way to check questionable emails is to hover the mouse 		(without clicking any buttons) over the links in the suspected emails.
 Looking at the bottom border of the email window, an Internet location 		in the form of a URL to the website can be seen.
 If that link does not 		appear to be from the company sending the email it is a very good 		indication that it is a redirecting scam.
 It is a good practice 		to never click links in unsolicited emails until the computer user is 		certain that the links are safe.
