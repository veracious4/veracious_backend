 Methods:           The authors collected data on sexual assault victimization by using a cross-sectional, Web-based survey, and they conducted analyses assessing the role of substance use.
 The authors also compared victimizations before and during college, and across years of study.
 Results:           Findings indicate that almost 20% of undergraduate women experienced some type of completed sexual assault since entering college.
 Most sexual assaults occurred after women voluntarily consumed alcohol, whereas few occurred after women had been given a drug without their knowledge or consent.
 Conclusions:           The authors discuss implications for campus sexual assault prevention programs, including the need for integrated substance use and sexual victimization prevention programming.
