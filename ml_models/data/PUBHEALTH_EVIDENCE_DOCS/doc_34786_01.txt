 Also know that God has provided the hope for us to see Christopher again through the acceptance of God's grace and salvation.
 Regina L Cook   July 10, 2015 Although we never met I have followed Christopher's progress for over 2.5 years.
 As you may remember we were joined by a common thread, TBI.
 Although our outcome was not to be the same fates as Christopher's the journey is still a long road to travel.
 I often wonder why so many are taken, so many are spared and then I realize it's not up to me to question what God's plans are.
 Nothing I can say will give you the comfort you need but trust in GOD and believe in him and he will give you the comfort that you are looking for.
 I will miss seeing your daily updates on Christopher but I know in my heart he is free from pain and now he is watching over you.
 many, many hugs!

 Battistella Family   July 7, 2015 Our deepest sympathies.
 Bless your family and bless your Christopher.
 What a strong courageous boy you had.
 Teresa Pratt   July 7, 2015 Christopher was so blessed to be part of the Hamrick family.
 A family that stayed strong and supportive for so long in the face of such unimaginable tragedy.
 Tena, Christopher's mother is an example of what lengths a loving mother would go to for her child.And the world left a better place because of Christopher's short life.
 His resolve to say "mom", to lift his arm, to live, when many other's would have given up shines as a beacon of what one can do when he is surrounded by love.Christopher, you brought almost 7,000 people together on facebook.
 7,000 strangers who turned into friends and an extended family.
 7,000 people who prayed day and night for God to heal you, and to give your family strength.How I wish I could be there to say goodbye.
 But I'll be here in Pennsylvania, releasing green balloons for you.
 And I'll be praying for your mom and the rest of your family.
 May they find peace and strength.
 God bless you Christopher, you are loved by many.
 Goodbye little guy.
 Steve &amp; Dawn Phares   July 7, 2015 No bond is as great as that between a parent and child.
 Our deepest condolences are with you as you grieve.
