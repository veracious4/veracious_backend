 Efforts are ongoing to repeal the Affordable Care Act which would exacerbate health-care inequities.
 By contrast, a universal system, such as that proposed in the Medicare for All Act, has the potential to transform the availability and efficiency of American health-care services.
 Taking into account both the costs of coverage expansion and the savings that would be achieved through the Medicare for All Act, we calculate that a single-payer, universal health-care system is likely to lead to a 13% savings in national health-care expenditure, equivalent to more than US$450 billion annually (based on the value of the US$ in 2017).
 The entire system could be funded with less financial outlay than is incurred by employers and households paying for health-care premiums combined with existing government allocations.
 This shift to single-payer health care would provide the greatest relief to lower-income households.
 Furthermore, we estimate that ensuring health-care access for all Americans would save more than 68 000 lives and 1·73 million life-years every year compared with the status quo.IntroductionMore than 78 million Americans do not have adequate health insurance,1Collins SR Gunja MZ Doty MM How well does health coverage protect consumers from costs?

 We find that the expected savings from a universal single-payer system would more than compensate for the increased expenditure associated with universal health-care coverage.
 Moreover, universal health care would save lives while simultaneously improving the quality and productivity of those lives, as detailed here.
 Specifically, we calculate that the Medicare for All Act would reduce national health-care expenditure by more than US$458 billion, corresponding to 13·1% of health-care expenditure in 2017.
 We also project that the Medicare for All Act would save more than 68 500 lives every year, compared with the status quo.
 If the Affordable Care Act were to be repealed, we would expect an additional annual loss of more than 38 500 lives.
 Compared with health-care access before the Affordable Care Act, the legislation proposed by Senator Sanders, would save 107 000 lives annually.
 To inform policy makers' ongoing deliberations, we also introduce an interactive online tool through which users can explore how input assumptions influence spending projections and tailor a plan to finance the predicted expenditure.13The Center for Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis Yale School of Public HealthSingle-payer healthcare interactive financing tool.http://shift.cidma.usDate: Feb 26, 2017Date accessed: February 21, 2019Google ScholarBudgetary projections for single-payer universal health careSingle-payer universal health care has long been perceived as politically and economically impractical in the USA.

 Accordingly, we develop the Single-payer Healthcare Interactive Financing Tool (SHIFT) in which these parameters can be adjusted (figure 1).
 SHIFT similarly enables the customisation of a national financing plan in which insurance premiums paid by employers and individuals would be replaced with other options, such as a payroll tax.
 Projections from SHIFT indicate that the Medicare for All Act would yield net savings for the health-care system across a wide range of assumptions regarding insurance expansion, service improvements, administrative efficiency, and pharmaceutical pricing (figure 2; panel).Figure 1Single-payer Healthcare Interactive Financing Tool (SHIFT) interfaceShow full captionThis tool allows users to adjust input parameters and assumptions, including expansion in health-care service use, to determine the health-care budget.
 Revenue generation options to cover the projected budget can also be selected.
 Here, we provide a modified static image of the tool, displaying all adjustable parameters set to their default values.
 (A) Reducing physician and clinical fees (base case: 7·38%; range: 0–19·23%) and hospital fees (5·54%; 0–18·74%).
 (B) Reducing fraud (4%; 0–10%) and overheads (2·2%; 2·2–12·4%).
 (C) Pharmaceutical price reduction (40%; 0–60%) and projected health care use by people who are uninsured upon becoming insured, compared with those who are already adequately insured (50·1%; 50·1–100%).
 For example, if hospital and clinical fees are each reduced by 5% the total budget becomes US$3054 billion.
 Furthermore, the total budget becomes $3144 billion if an overhead rate of 2·2% and a fraud reduction of 0% are enacted.
 If pharmaceutical costs are reduced by 40% and health-care service use by people who were previously uninsured is maintained at 50% of those who are adequately insured, then the total budget would be $2887 billion.View Large            Image           Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res            image           Download (PPT)PanelParameter defaults and bounds for the Single-payer Healthcare Interactive Financing Tool (SHIFT)The following parameters are adjustable within our user-friendly tool, SHIFT.

 Moreover, the additional provider time will be in demand following the expected increase in service use.Recognising the benefits to providers and patients, National Nurses United and Physicians for a National Health Program are both advocates of the Medicare for All Act.
 By contrast, the American Hospital Association is opposed to the act.
 The American Hospital Association has argued that it relies on private patients to subsidise the care of patients covered by the Medicare and Medicaid schemes.
 However, the lower Medicaid fees will be replaced by the higher Medicare reimbursements, and the burden of unpaid bills will be eliminated.
 This adjustment would particularly ameliorate the financial struggles of hospitals serving low-income communities.
 Likewise, the financial relief from reduced administrative tasks and eliminated unpaid bills might not yet be routinely considered by stakeholders.Unified system for billing and administrationAdministrative overhead costs associated with providing health insurance comprise 12·4% of spending for insurance companies compared with 2·2% for the Medicare scheme.26Woolhandler S Himmelstein DU Single-payer reform: the only way to fulfill the President's pledge of more coverage, better benefits, and lower costs.Ann Intern Med.
 2017; 166: 587-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar Although an inherent risk exists that such overhead efficiency would not remain after the scheme had been scaled up, expanding Medicare to a larger population could facilitate improved efficiency.
 Therefore, applying the current overhead rate, we calculate that a further $219 billion could be saved annually by consolidating all insurance schemes into the Medicare framework.
 Components of this reduction in overheads include the elimination of redundant corporate functions and the truncation of the top-heavy salary architecture of health insurance corporations.

 The imperative for price control is rivalled by the political power of pharmaceutical corporations, emboldened by the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that lifted restrictions on corporate political expenditures.
 By contrast, the negotiating authority (which can control medication and medical equipment prices) is a fundamental component of the Medicare for All Act.
 Through representation of the entire US market, the US Department of Health and Human Services would have considerable negotiating power.
 The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has the capacity to negotiate prices that align with the therapeutic value of pharmaceutical drugs and could be a potential model for the federal single-payer health-care system.

 Conversely, savings would increase beyond our base case if our model overestimates the unfulfilled demand in people who do not have insurance or are underinsured.
 Given that $2261 billion is already allocated to health care by existing governmental and philanthropic sources (appendix p 5), a further $773 billion must be collected by the government to fully fund the Medicare for All Act.Figure 3Overview of Single-payer Healthcare Interactive Financing Tool (SHIFT) calculationsShow full captionArrows indicate changes in total national health-care expenditure upon implementation of each step.

 Although taxes are usually associated with deadweight loss, as higher prices can dampen transactions within a market, the replacement of the legal obligation to provide health care with a tax that does so at a reduced cost is likely to act as an economic stimulus for employers.59US Census BureauAmerica's families and living arrangements: 2017, Average number of people (AVG table series).

 We estimated that on an annual basis, universal coverage would save 68 531 lives in the USA.
 These are predominantly the lives of young people, given that most individuals older than 64 years are already covered under Medicare.
 Adults aged 25–35 years are disproportionately represented, accounting for more than 9 million of the uninsured.
 Based on the age distribution of these premature deaths that would be averted and their corresponding age-specific life expectancies, we calculated that universal coverage would save 1·73 million life-years annually.

 Our calculation of the life-saving potential of the Medicare for All Act is highly conservative in a number of aspects.
 Additional lives would likely be saved through the improvements in continuity of care facilitated by a single-payer system.
 Moreover, this calculation does not incorporate the improvements in survival from fully insuring the 41 million people who are underinsured, and therefore currently forego necessary care.1Collins SR Gunja MZ Doty MM How well does health coverage protect consumers from costs?

 2017; 12CD003054PubMed Google Scholar Given that a single-payer system would be financially responsible for health care throughout the lifespan of all Americans, it becomes efficient to incur a small cost in the present with the purpose of avoiding more serious and costly health conditions in the future.
 By contrast, private insurance companies, within which patients are most often transiently enrolled, maximise profit by minimising short-term costs.
 This practice reflects the fiduciary responsibility of health insurance corporations to their shareholders; it also inherently disincentivises the prioritisation of long-term health.
 Shortsighted cost-cutting can catalyse a cascade of longer-term health and financial repercussions over the lifespan of a patient.
 The single payer health-care system in Canada spends more per capita on prevention (6·2%), allocating more than double the funding to prevention as a share of total national health expenditure than the USA (2·8%).73Gmeinder M Morgan D Mueller M How much do OECD countries spend on prevention?.OECD Health Working Papers.

 For example, despite the unprecedented epidemic of opioid dependence in the USA, many insurance companies continue to refuse reimbursement for less addictive, but more expensive medications, and for physical therapy alternatives.75Thomas K Ornstein C Amid opioid crisis, insurers restrict pricey, less addictive painkillers.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/health/opioid-painkillers-insurance-companies.htmlDate: Sept 17, 2017Date accessed: December 1, 2019Google Scholar Over a patient's lifetime, the higher prices of alternative medications for chronic pain are likely to be dwarfed by the benefits to health and quality of life that stem from averting addiction and the downstream costs of substance abuse treatment.

 This restructuring erases in-network and out-of-network distinctions and the issue of health-care providers declining to accept individuals based on their insurance status.
 Patient choice will be dramatically expanded if a universal health-care system is adopted.
 With the uncoupling of employment status from insurance plans, a single-payer system would also resolve system fragmentation that arises during employment transition (eg, a patient's former doctor is considered out-of-network under a new employer's insurance plan).
 This fragmentation decreases the efficacy of chronic disease management and delays care for acute conditions.
 Universal single-payer coverage eliminates the danger of losing health care when it is needed most.
 For many Americans, a serious illness precipitates the simultaneous losses of income and employment-based health insurance.

 By removing cost barriers for patients and by consolidating mental health practitioners into a single network, the Medicare for All Act would help close the perpetually widening gap between mental health needs and access to services.Time to actAs public support for health-care reform mounts in the USA, legislators are poised to transform the health-care system and save thousands of lives every year.
 Single-payer universal health care has the potential to improve the quality, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility of medical services.
 Our projections indicate that implementing the Medicare for All Act specifically would generate net savings across a wide range of possible expenditure and financing options.
 Objections to the Medicare for All Act based on the expectation of rising costs are mistaken.
 Some Americans express concern about the federal government controlling this large sector of the economy, or about violating capitalist principles.
 However, the health-care sector is already highly regulated in many aspects, and deviates from capitalist ideals through opaque and often monopolistic pricing.
 Strong opposition should be expected from powerful vested interests, including the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries.
 Counterbalancing these concerns is the moral imperative to provide health care as a human right, not dependent on employment or affluence.
 The medical community should seize this opportunity to promote wellbeing, enhance prosperity, and establish a more equitable health-care system for all Americans.ContributorsAPG conceived of the study.
