 ET | Register Now &gt;&gt;NewsHomeWhite House 'Nearly Certain' Iran Will Still Fund TerrorismOfficials told a Senate panel that the economic windfall accompanying sanctions relief was less of a threat than a nuclear-armed Iran.By Teresa Welsh, Staff Writer Aug. 5, 2015By Teresa Welsh, Staff Writer Aug. 5, 2015, at 3:21 p.m. MoreWhite House 'Nearly Certain' Iran Will Still Fund TerrorismMoreState Department Undersecretary For Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, pictured at a July 29 hearing on Capitol Hill, was among Obama administration officials who told a Senate panel Wednesday that Iran would likely continue to fund terrorism when economic sanctions are lifted.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesSenior Obama administration officials told a Senate panel Wednesday that it is “nearly certain” Iran will continue funding terrorism with the tens of billions of dollars it stands to gain if Congress approves a nuclear deal that would lift economic sanctions on the country.Testifying on the economic aspects of the agreement negotiated between the Islamic republic and six world powers, administration officials acknowledged Tehran’s longstanding role supporting terror but said reaching a deal to limit the country’s nuclear ambitions was of paramount importance.Kerry Denies Seeing Iran Deal's Side Agreements "I expect we’ll continue to see that," Adam Szubin, acting undersecretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence told the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.
 "We’ve decided that we need to address the nuclear threat and then turn to the terrorism.”The remarks echoed what prominent administration officials have been saying in recent weeks, with even Obama himself admitting as much during a lengthy address Wednesday defending the agreement.
 Szubin's comments were prompted by questions from Sen. Bob Corker, who noted that the release of what some have estimated to be as much as $100 billion frozen by sanctions would amount to about a quarter of the Iranian economy.Szubin estimated the amount of money Iran would see as a result of the lifting of international sanctions would be about half what Corker thought, at about $50 billion, and fell back on another administration line when saying the danger of a nuclear-armed Iran far eclipsed the threat posed by the additional money in their coffers.
 He also suggested that, in the event the U.S. walks away from the deal, foreign banks holding frozen Iranian assets might not be willing to keep them.Netanyahu Appeals to American Jews on Iran Deal“I can’t guarantee you that they will,” he said.And while the administration officials noted that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had a mandate to fund the country’s urgent domestic spending needs – which now approach $500 billion in things like infrastructure and oil-sector improvements as well as military pensions – they said they share concerns about Iran’s capabilities after it is let loose from the crippling financial constraints.
 “As for Iran’s behavior, the United States is under no illusions,” Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman said.
 “This agreement was never based on the expectations that it would transform the Iranian regime or cause Tehran to cease contributing to sectarian violence and terrorism in the Middle East.
 That’s why we’ve made clear that we will continue our unprecedented levels of security cooperation with Israel.”Several senators at the hearing notably rejected politicization of congressional review of the deal, saying decisions on such an important national security matter should be based on examination of the agreement rather than party affiliation or politics, with Corker insisting it was important for lawmakers to understand the ramifications of their vote on the nuclear agreement.“This should not be a partisan effort,” said Corker, who is also chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
 “I can say to every one of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, regardless of how people vote on this, you’re not going to hear me making comments either way.
 I think this is a very important vote.”Corker has not officially announced he’ll be opposing the deal, but has been deeply skeptical of the administration’s arguments that it sufficiently blocks Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon.
 In a hearing two weeks ago, he told Kerry he believed the secretary of state had been “fleeced” by the Iranians because Kerry thought Iranian compliance with the agreement could be properly verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the international community.Sen.
 Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, who is next in line to be the Senate’s Democratic leader, said he’d not yet made a decision whether he will support the deal.
 Schumer is heavily supported by powerful Jewish groups that oppose the agreement and called his upcoming vote one of the most consequential of his career.“I’m carefully analyzing the proposed deal because it’s implications are profound and far reaching.
 I’ve had many questions answered.
 I’ve not yet reached a conclusion.
 This is one of the most important votes I’ve had to take – any of us have had to take – in our legislative career,” Schumer said.
 “I owe it to my constituents to make an informed decision.
 I won’t let party, pressure, or politics interfere with what I think is right.
 I want to judge the deal on the merits and the merits alone.”Corker to Kerry: 'You've Been Fleeced' on Iran DealRanking Banking Committee Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said he was “so disappointed” in the politicized nature of the debate.“This one of the most significant national security issues Congress will face in a generation,” Brown said.“This should not be subject to partisan attacks and political ad wars, even though it has been.
 Congress should give this agreement the serious debate that it deserves.”Under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, Congress has the ability to either approve the agreement, disapprove it, or do nothing.
 Corker is expected to introduce a companion bill to that introduced by his counterpart in the House, Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., earlier this week disapproving the deal, and votes are expected in September.
 Obama has said he will veto a vote of disapproval, and Senate Republicans would need at least 13 Democrats to override that presidential action.So far, 12 Senate Democrats have publicly come out in support of the deal, while 24 Republicans have come out in opposition.
 Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who opposes the agreement, questioned Sherman on the contents of two side agreements to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that were negotiated by Iran and the IAEA.
 As a matter of course, such safeguards agreements between IAEA and other countries are not publicly released.Sherman said she had seen the documents but could not provide them to Congress despite provisions of the Iran Nuclear Review Agreement Act that requires the administration to turn over the nuclear deal and all related annexes to Congress.“We must give you every document that we have,” Sherman said.
 “We have given you every document that we have.”Sherman said she made clear to negotiating partners that, under U.S. law, she would be required to share details of the side agreements with Congress.
 She said she would do so in a classified briefing with the entire Senate later Wednesday.Teresa Welsh, Staff WriterTeresa Welsh is a foreign affairs reporter at U.S. News &amp; World Report.
