State College of Florida records show that Beruff was absent for nine of 19 board of trustees meetings from August 2014 through April of this year.
 Just since October, he has missed six of seven meetings of the volunteer board.Beruff insists that half of those absences are a paperwork glitch.
 He said he submitted his resignation to Gov.
 Rick Scott's office in February, but the State College of Florida kept marking him absent.
 State College of Florida trustees met twice in February, for a workshop and a regular monthly meeting, and Beruff was absent both times.\"The State College of Florida has an issue,\" Beruff said during an interview Wednesday in Lutz.
 \"They can't keep up with the paperwork.\"But records from the governor's office show Beruff's letter of resignation was dated March 18 and not received by Scott's office until March 22, the day Beruff missed his third consecutive meeting.
 Beruff was marked absent again for an April 26 meeting, and on May 31 he was not included in the roll call.Beruff has never held elective office, but in 2009, then-Gov.
 Charlie Crist appointed the college dropout to three public boards, including making him a trustee for the State College of Florida.Beruff's attendance record for the other unpaid boards has been nearly spotless.
 On the board of the Southwest Florida Water Management District, Beruff did not miss a single meeting during his final year, from September 2014 to August 2015.
 On the board of the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport Authority, where Beruff is still an active board member, he has missed just one of nine meetings since the start of 2015, according to official minutes kept by the agency.

 The move comes after a Texas law restricting abortions was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Monday.

 Property taxes should drop along with a reduction in local millage rates, and a three-day sales tax holiday Aug. 5-7 should help back-to-school shoppers.

 He did not respond to requests for comment Friday, but told internal affairs investigators he was shocked when Reddick interrupted the April 7 meeting to accuse him of making the gesture.
 In it, he alleged that Gericitano violated a Police Department rule that requires employees, whether on or off duty, to \"conduct themselves in a manner which does not compromise their professionalism, ethics and objectives\" or impair their ability to do their jobs.
 No witness could say they saw Gericitano make the gesture that Reddick said he saw.
 But she did say Gericitano had mentioned the chairman's election to her before the meeting.
 \"And I said to him, 'You don't have to worry about anything, because I plan on nominating Harry Cohen.'
 But none of those rounds of voting produced the necessary four out of seven votes for any one of three candidates: Cohen, Reddick or Mike Suarez.
 Eventually, the council decided to elect a vice chairman first, and Cohen was chosen, which took him out of the running for the chairmanship.
 That set up a two-way choice between Reddick and Suarez, who won.
 This year, however, more drama was expected because the council chairman would move into the mayor's office if Mayor Bob Buckhorn resigned early either to run for governor or to take a job in a Hillary Clinton presidential administration.
 While he stands by his claim, he said he doesn't feel the need to pursue the matter further.
