Damn them!&#8221; Photo courtesy of the Office of the Attorney General \n Virginia Attorney General Ken &#8220;The Cooch&#8221; Cuccinelli certainly has made a name for himself in recent years.
 \n The Tea Party favorite and likely successor to Gov.
 Bob McDonnell moved to impose stricter regulations on abortion clinics , censored the commonwealth&#8217;s seal on lapel pins for his office, insinuated the President Obama isn&#8217;t a U.S. citizen , told Virginians that they can legally take their guns to church , covertly tried to allow state universities to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and led the charge against President Obama&#8217;s health care overhaul ( he failed ).
 \n More recently, though, The Cooch waded into a local debate.
 \n In a call to conservative radio show The Morning Majority (WMAL 105.9 FM) on Tuesday, Cuccinelli offered his opinion on recent news that rats have been spotted at the Occupy D.C. encampment at McPherson Square.
 (The station stole our picture for their post on the news, but hey, that&#8217;s for another day.)
 Said The Cooch : \n Cuccinelli: Well, I saw the same rat story about D.C. that y&#8217;all have been talking about.
 What you may not know is that last year, in its finite wisdom, the D.C. City Council passed a new law, or a triumph of animal rights over human health, where those pest control people you suggested they bring in aren&#8217;t allowed to kill the rats.
 They have to relocate the rats and not only that &#8212; that&#8217;s actually not the worst part &#8212; they cannot break up the families of the rats.
 Now, as actual experts in pest control will tell you, if you don&#8217;t move an animal at least 25 miles, it&#8217;ll come back.
 And so what&#8217;s the solution to that?
 Well, cross a river.
 \n Host: Send &#8217;em over to Virginia, that&#8217;s right.
 \n Cuccinelli: Guess why I care about that sort of thing?
 \n Other host: I bet.
 \n Cuccinelli: Anyway, it is worse than our immigration policy &#8212; you can&#8217;t break up families.
 Or raccoons or all the rest and you can&#8217;t even kill them.
 Unbelievable.
 \n \n Not to impeach your expert testimony here, counselor, but a few asides are necessary.
 \n First, the law you&#8217;re referring to &#8212; the Wildlife Protection Act of 2010, sponsored by Councilmember Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) &#8212; explicitly exempts rats and mice from its provisions.
 So yes, while a family of raccoons might have to be relocated, rats are fair game for pest control experts.
 (And before you jump on us over the wisdom of the law, note that a Northern Virginia-based pest control expert testified on behalf of the bill.
 Just sayin&#8217;.)
 \n Second, well, we&#8217;re not really sure how to respond to the accusation that D.C. pest control teams are sneaking rats into Virginia under cover of darkness.
 It&#8217;s so villainous!
 So unethical!
 So untrue .
 But hey, if you want to station Virginia State Troopers on the Key Bridge, Memorial Bridge, Chain Bridge, 14th Street Bridge and along the shores of the Potomac, feel free.
 We&#8217;ll find a way to get our rats into the commonwealth, whether we have to air-drop them in over Richmond with little parachutes.
 Occupy Virginia indeed.
 \n Finally, we&#8217;re not really sure if that little snipe about immigration policy means that you think that immigrants should be killed.
 Just for that, we&#8217;re sending a few hundred extra rats over tonight.
 \n Arlington, Alexandria &#8212; it was in 1847 that you guys were given back to the commonwealth after having been part of the original land set aside for the creation of our fair city.
 If you want to re-retrocede yourselves back to D.C. once The Cooch is elected governor, we and our rats will happily take you.

 \n \u201cI am relieved that there is a sense of normalcy, humility and just humanitarian compassion back in the White House,\u201d said Malcolm Sherod, a 26-year-old lobbyist, after taking a celebratory swill of champagne straight from the bottle in Black Lives Matter Plaza.
 \u201cI feel like every day I\u2018ve been holding my breath in the worst nightmare of my life.
 I am so happy that day is over.\u201d \n The ever-growing crowd danced to the iconic riffs of Kool &amp; The Gang\u2019s \u201cCelebration,\u201d making good on the lyrics: \u201cThere&#8217;s a party goin&#8217; on right here.\u201d \n Across the rest of the city, drivers honked their horns, residents clanged all manner of pots and pans, and people cheered out of their windows on a bright, unseasonably warm November afternoon.
 \n On a sidewalk in Columbia Heights, a group of 20-somethings drank champagne out of paper cups, while a couple danced salsa in the walkway to their home.
 Going up 15th Street in Northwest, women sang \u201cF*ck Donald Trump\u201d repeatedly out their car windows as they rode in their vehicles.
 Down by Farragut Square, a convertible headed across K street with a cardboard cutout of Joe Biden standing up in the backseat.
 A number of Metrobus drivers changed one of their digital signs on the front of the bus to read \u201cJoe.\u201d \n Biden surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed with an AP call for his win in Pennsylvania at 11:25 a.m. A bit more than an hour later, the wire service also called Nevada in his favor.
 That puts the electoral vote total at 290 for President-elect Biden and 214 for President Trump.
 (Alaska, Georgia, and North Carolina remain to be called.)
 \n Minutes later, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton spoke to the crowd gathered near McPherson Square.
 \n &#8220;The American people are ready to see Donald Trump going, going, gone,&#8221; she said.
 \n A small, but excited crowd also gathered on the grounds of Howard University, where student groups danced around the quad and alumni of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in support of member and now Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
 \n \u201cIt\u2019s just a historic day.
 A day of joy and relief for us all, and I couldn\u2019t think of any better place to come,\u201d said Tralonne Shorter, who came over from Arlington with her young son to celebrate at her alma mater.
 \u201cAt a time in our country when there have been so many challenges and barriers to equal justice and for people of color and our reckoning, for someone to be in the White House at this time, coming from historically black colleges, really sort of underscores the value of Black Lives Matter.
 And so Howard is significant.\u201d \n Howard student Ashley Gray came to the campus on Saturday \u2014 three days after completing her dissertation on Black women in leadership \u2014 to celebrate Harris\u2019 achievement.
 A history-making win three times over, Harris will be the first female, the first South Asian-American, and the first Black vice president.
 \n \u201cThere\u2019s symbolic history in us being here, and her having gotten her foundation here, so this is a great place to be today,\u201d Gray said.
 \n Still, the nucleus of the city\u2019s jubilation is in the jam-packed blocks around the White House, where cars are stuck in the most exuberant kind of gridlock and thousands of people are dancing in the streets.
 \n A mainstay of protests this summer, the Long Live Go-Go truck blasted the \u201cY.M.C.A,\u201d reclaiming it after a year of the song playing at Donald Trump rallies .
 At least two couples getting married today celebrated in Black Lives Matter Plaza.\u00a0An overflowing trash can was surrounded by champagne bottles .
 \n Indeed, Imperial Wine and Spirits near Farragut Square did brisk business on Saturday.
 \n Manager Channa Desilva said he sold more than 100 bottles of champagne in just a few hours, pointing to five empty shelves.
 Business had been slow during the pandemic, and the store was boarded up ahead of the election.
 But the tide had turned.
 \n \u201cPeople are celebrating, I\u2019m telling you,\u201d said Desilva, a Sri Lankan immigrant who lives in Silver Spring.
 \n He decided to keep the store open past its normal closing time of 6 p.m. \n Howard University alumni Tralonne Shorter and Megan Weaver, members of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, came to campus to celebrate the success of their fellow alumnus and sister, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris Rachel Kurzius \/ DCist\/WAMU  D.C. resident Malcolm Sherod takes a swig of champange while celebrating Biden's victory in Black Lives Matter Plaza Daniella Cheslow \/ DCist\/WAMU  D.C. resident Kareem Primo celebrates in Black Lives Matter Plaza.

 Dominique Maria Bonessi \/ DCist\/WAMU \n D.C. resident Rob Sassor was at home when he heard honking and the clatter of pots and pans, and knew he wanted to head to BLM Plaza.
 \n \u201cWe knew that this was coming, it was just a matter of time,\u201d Sassor said.
 \u201cBut it\u2019s good to finally have it culminate.\u201d \n While the celebration of Biden\u2019s win in BLM Plaza was marked with dancing, singing, and an inflatable Trump-as-rat float , some noted that the work doesn\u2019t end when Trump leaves office.
 Among those gathered downtown, several highlighted issues they\u2019d want Biden to prioritize as president.
 D.C. resident Hope Puiton said that Democrats now need to work to hold Biden accountable on his campaign promises, like addressing racial injustice and climate change.
 \n \u201cIt\u2019s a tall order,\u201d Puiton said of Biden\u2019s now-expected deliverables.
 \u201cDems need to keep pushing, keep organizing.
 This is clearly just the beginning.\u201d \n Others seemed less enthusiastic about the Biden victory, but relieved nonetheless about the soon-to-be end of Trump\u2019s stay in the White House.
 Beyond BLM Plaza, cars drove down Columbia Pike in Arlington, honking their horns as people milled about a popular taco truck.
 \n \u201cI don\u2019t think Joe Biden is the answer nor is Harris,\u201d said resident Nicole Green who gathered with the group.
 \u201cBut I\u2019m just happy that we don\u2019t have a complete narcissist in the White House anymore.\u201d \n Biden issued a statement on Saturday after the race was called, saying he was \u201chonored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me.\u201d \n \u201cIn the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted.
 Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America,\u201d Biden said in the brief statement.
 He is expected to address the nation at 8 p.m. \n In a city where Trump got a mere 5% of the vote, residents and elected officials alike responded with glee.
 \n \u201cAs the nation\u2019s capital, Washington, DC has a special interest in who becomes our most famous neighbor, and we could not be prouder to have President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris join our city,\u201d Bowser said in a statement.
 \u201cThey will not only bring dignity back to the White House, but a real commitment to the shared values we uphold and fight for every day in our city \u2014 the values embodied by Black Lives Matter Plaza leading right up to their front door.\u201d \n The mayor followed up with a tweet : \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting to exhale for four years.\u201d Other local leaders also shared their excitement on social media.
 Ward 5 D.C. Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie tweeted his congratulations , as did Ward 6\u2019s Charles Allen (he also made a pitch to mobilize support in a Georgia Senate race run-off with D.C. statehood in mind).
 Two of the council\u2019s newest members, Christina Henderson and Janeese Lewis George, are Harris\u2019 Alpha Kappa Alpha sisters.
 \n For much of the day, Trump was out golfing in Virginia.
 He returned around 3 p.m., passing crowds of people alternatively cheering or giving the middle finger to his motorcade.
 \n The Trump campaign is still contesting the process in several states, including Pennsylvania.
 The president and his team have made a number of false accusations, baselessly claiming that the election is being stolen from him as legitimate ballots continue to be counted.
 In Pennsylvania and other places, mail-in ballots that are taking longer to count have broken heavily toward Biden and eaten into significant leads by the president in votes cast on Election Day.
 States will certify results in the coming weeks.
 \n About 50 Trump supporters gathered around the base of the Washington Monument on Saturday afternoon, singing the Star Spangled Banner, praying, and, at one point, facing off a larger group of Biden supporters and chanting \u201cNo more years.\u201d \n But at a stoplight on 16th Street on Saturday afternoon, a woman stood up through the sunroof of her car, beaming and waving a Biden-Harris banner.
 It was pointed straight down the road, at the White House.
 \n Rachel Kurzius, Daniella Cheslow, Matt Blitz, and Dominique Maria Bonessi contributed reporting.\u00a0 \n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":" Scenes of glee and jubilation are playing out in different forms across the city.
 \n Both D.C. locals and out-of-state travellers marched near Black Lives Matter Plaza and McPherson Square \u2014 the hubs of activity over the past three days of the election \u2014 demanding that every vote be counted.
 There was go-go music (a staple of protests over the past several months in the city), chanting, dancing, and a massive Trump-as-rat inflatable float.\u00a0 \n Thais Carrero, head of Pennsylvania\u2019s CASA chapter, an advocacy organization for Latino and immigrant residents, brought a group of around 50 people to D.C. for the demonstrations on Friday.
 She said they were there both to celebrate the record voter turnout amongst Latinos this election and demand that all their votes be counted.
 \n \u201cWe want change.
 We want our voices to be heard,\u201d Carrero says.
 \u201cLatinos came out in record numbers and that shows that we&#8217;re willing to step up and that we showed up.
 And now it&#8217;s time for Washington to show up for us.\u201d \n Early Friday morning, Biden pulled ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania \u2014 a key state that could secure Biden\u2019s victory.
 He now holds a lead in Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania with thousands of votes still to be counted (although Trump\u2019s supporters have led \u201cstop the vote\u201d protests in jurisdictions where votes that came in after Election Day favored Biden.)
 \n For Carrero, who moved to Pennsylvania from Puerto Rico five years ago, it\u2019s important to highlight the work of Latino voters in the state, she says \u2014 and to recognize that after the election, the fight still won\u2019t be over.
 \n \u201cWhat I see, and what came out to the polls \u2014 in terms of people who look like me, people of color, immigrants, boricuas\u2014 what we see is the very foundation of the many changes that we need,\u201d Carrero says.
 \u201cWe know that this is not a complete celebration because our struggle continues\u2026we envision a future where we can start reversing all that damage that has been done for the past four years.\u201d \n This Trump balloon marched down K Street with protesters on Friday.

 Friday marked the fourth day of protests in D.C. after days of uncertainty about the outcome of the presidential election.
 While the city had prepared for possible civil unrest, demonstrations throughout the week remained peaceful.
 And on Friday, the crowd in BLM Plaza held out hope for a peaceful end to \u201celection week.\u201d \n Dan, a Bethesda resident who declined to give his last name due to employment concerns, biked to BLM Plaza in a jersey printed with the U.S. Constitution.
 While he says the election\u2019s \u201cnot over til\u2019 it\u2019s over,\u201d he has faith in democracy and that the voting process will result in a fair election by the American people.
 \n \u201cI&#8217;m very proud of our country, and that the people can take back the country from where it&#8217;s been, and we can show the world what a democracy really is about and that not one person will control it,\u201d Dan says.
 \u201cSo, today is a celebration to me of the Constitution.\u201d \n Aniyah Vines, a Howard University student and president of the schools\u2019 NAACP organization, led the \u201cCount Every Vote\u201d march through BLM Plaza on Friday.
 While she\u2019s hoping for an end to Trump\u2019s presidency, she says a Biden victory won\u2019t bring an end to frequent protests in her community.
 \n \u201cRegardless of who takes on the presidency, we have to continue to make sure that that person stays accountable,\u201d says Vines, who regularly attends protests in D.C. \u201cMaking sure that we understand that there&#8217;s not going to be immediate change in the Black and Brown community, we have to continue to apply pressure.\u201d \n Vines echoed a point made by local demonstrators earlier in the week, when an election night demonstration ended in a protest against police brutality at the 4D police station: protests will continue to be a mainstay.
 \n \u201cI always like to tell people that they thought that after the first weekend of June, it was going to be done, they thought that the murder of George Floyd and the uproar was going to just be a trend,\u201d Vines says.
 \u201cThat&#8217;s definitely not the case.

 (1\/2) pic.twitter.com\/BlUvfVSbmA \n &mdash; Jeff McKay (@JeffreyCMcKay) November 6, 2020 \n \n The markers and artifacts removed include a monument honoring the first Confederate soldier to be killed by a Union soldier, a historical marker commemorating a June 1, 1861 battle, and two Dahlgren howitzers .
 \n These artifacts will be kept in a county warehouse pending\u00a0 donation to other historical organizations and sites .
 The monument will go to the Stuart Mosby Historical Society in Centreville, per a 9 to 1 Fairfax Board of Supervisors vote last month .
 The heavy Dahlgren howitzers are going to a Manassas Battlefield, and the historical marker will be given to the state of Virginia.
 \n The removal of the artifacts was estimated to cost about $20,000, according to board minutes from October 20.
 \n \u201cI\u2019m glad we were able to move forward and remove these Confederate monuments,&#8221; McKay writes in a statement to DCist\/WAMU.
 &#8220;We need to ensure that in our courthouse &#8211; our place of fair justice &#8211; we are intentionally ensuring that symbols matter, reflect our values, and chart a more positive course forward.&#8221; \n This is the most recent Confederate statue-removal that takes advantage of a relatively new Virginia law allowing local jurisdictions to decide what to do with Confederate monuments in their communities.
 Prior, localities were not allowed to remove, modify or add historical context to markers or memorials without approval from Virginia\u2019s General Assembly .
 \n Virginia had the second-most Confederate memorials of any state in the country (behind only Georgia) as of February 2019, according to the \u00a0Southern Poverty Law Center .
 Many of the statues were erected in the late 1800s and early 1900s during a time of heightened public interest in Civil War commemoration.
