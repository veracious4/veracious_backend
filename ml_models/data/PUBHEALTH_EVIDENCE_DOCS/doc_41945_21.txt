 On June 12, 2016, just after 2 a.m., an Orlando Police Officer working extra duty at the Pulse Nightclub, located at 1912 S. Orange Ave., responded to shots fired.
 Our officer engaged in a gun battle with that suspect and the suspect went deeper into the club where more shots were fired.
 The incident then turned into a hostage situation.
 The suspect – later identified as 29-year-old Omar Mir Seddique Mateen of Fort Pierce, Florida – continued shooting inside the club.
 At 5 a.m., the decision was made to breach the club and rescue the hostages, OPD Chief John Mina said.
 Officers were able to rescue 30 hostages and lead them to safety.
 Our SWAT Officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect, killing him.
 The gunman, an American citizen living in Florida, legally purchased the firearms within the last week, said Trevor Velinor, Asst.
 Special Agent In Charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Tampa Field Office.
 The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will conduct the Officer Involved Shooting investigation.
 The 11 OPD officers  involved are relieved of duty, as is standard in any officer involved shooting.
 A total of 50 people were killed in the shooting; an additional 53 were injured.
 Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said Sunday afternoon: “This is probably the most difficult day in the history of Orlando.”   The FBI is the lead Federal Law  Enforcement agency and is answering questions through its Main National Press Office at 202-324-3691.
