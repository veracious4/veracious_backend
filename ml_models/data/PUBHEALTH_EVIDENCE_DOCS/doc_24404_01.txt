.—The individual responsibility 23requirement provided for in this section (in this sub-24section referred to as the ‘‘requirement’’) is commer-25 321 O:\BAI\BAI09M01.xml [file 1 of 9] S.L.C. 
cial and economic in nature, and substantially af-1fects interstate commerce, as a result of the effects 2described in paragraph (2). 3(2) EFFECTSONTHENATIONALECONOMYAND
 4INTERSTATECOMMERCE
.—The effects described in 5this paragraph are the following: 6(A) The requirement regulates activity that 7is commercial and economic in nature: economic 8and financial decisions about how and when 9health care is paid for, and when health insur-10ance is purchased. 11(B) Health insurance and health care serv-12ices are a significant part of the national econ-13omy. National health spending is projected to 14increase from $2,500,000,000,000, or 17.6 per-15cent of the economy, in 2009 to 16$4,700,000,000,000 in 2019. Private health in-17surance spending is projected to be 18$854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for med-19ical supplies, drugs, and equipment that are 20shipped in interstate commerce. Since most 21health insurance is sold by national or regional 22health insurance companies, health insurance is 23sold in interstate commerce and claims pay-24ments flow through interstate commerce. 25 322 O:\BAI\BAI09M01.xml [file 1 of 9] S.L.C. 
(C) The requirement, together with the 1other provisions of this Act, will add millions of 2new consumers to the health insurance market, 3increasing the supply of, and demand for, 4health care services. According to the Congres-5sional Budget Office, the requirement will in-6crease the number and share of Americans who 7are insured. 8(D) The requirement achieves near-uni-9versal coverage by building upon and strength-10ening the private employer-based health insur-11ance system, which covers 176,000,000 Ameri-12cans nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar re-13quirement has strengthened private employer- 14based coverage: despite the economic downturn, 15the number of workers offered employer-based 16coverage has actually increased. 17(E) Half of all personal bankruptcies are 18caused in part by medical expenses. By signifi-19cantly increasing health insurance coverage, the 20requirement, together with the other provisions 21of this Act, will improve financial security for 22families. 23(F) Under the Employee Retirement In-24come Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et 25 323 O:\BAI\BAI09M01.xml [file 1 of 9] S.L.C. 
seq.), the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.), and this Act, the Federal Govern-2ment has a significant role in regulating health 3insurance which is in interstate commerce. 4(G) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the 5Public Health Service Act (as added by section 61201 of this Act), if there were no requirement, 7many individuals would wait to purchase health 8insurance until they needed care. By signifi-9cantly increasing health insurance coverage, the 10requirement, together with the other provisions 11of this Act, will minimize this adverse selection 12and broaden the health insurance risk pool to 13include healthy individuals, which will lower 14health insurance premiums. The requirement is 15essential to creating effective health insurance 16markets in which improved health insurance 17products that are guaranteed issue and do not 18exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can 19be sold. 20(H) Administrative costs for private health 21insurance, which were $90,000,000,000 in 222006, are 26 to 30 percent of premiums in the 23current individual and small group markets. By 24significantly increasing health insurance cov-25 324 O:\BAI\BAI09M01.xml [file 1 of 9] S.L.C. 
erage and the size of purchasing pools, which 1will increase economies of scale, the require-2ment, together with the other provisions of this 3Act, will significantly reduce administrative 4costs and lower health insurance premiums. 5The requirement is essential to creating effec-6tive health insurance markets that do not re-7quire underwriting and eliminate its associated 8administrative costs. 9(3) SUPREMECOURTRULING
.—In United 10States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association 11(322 U.S. 533 (1944)), the Supreme Court of the 12United States ruled that insurance is interstate com-13merce subject to Federal regulation. 14(b) INGENERAL.—Subtitle D of the Internal Rev-15enue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the 16following new chapter: 17‚‚CHAPTER 48ŠMAINTENANCE OF 18MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE 19‘‘Sec.5000A.Requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LONG-TERM 
18CARE. 19(a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the following 20findings: 21(1) Nearly 2 decades have passed since Con-22gress seriously considered long-term care reform. 23The United States Bipartisan Commission on Com-24prehensive Health Care, also know as the ‘‘Pepper 25 491 O:\ERN\ERN09C11.xml [file 2 of 9] S.L.C. 
Commission’’, released its ‘‘Call for Action’’ blue-1print for health reform in September 1990. In the 220 years since those recommendations were made, 3Congress has never acted on the report. 4(2) In 1999, under the United States Supreme 5Court’s decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 6(1999), individuals with disabilities have the right to 7choose to receive their long-term services and sup-8ports in the community, rather than in an institu-9tional setting. 10(3) Despite the Pepper Commission and 11Olmstead decision, the long-term care provided to 12our Nation‘s elderly and disabled has not improved. 13In fact, for many, it has gotten far worse. 14(4) In 2007, 69 percent of Medicaid long-term 15care spending for elderly individuals and adults with 16physical disabilities paid for institutional services. 17Only 6 states spent 50 percent or more of their 18Medicaid long-term care dollars on home and com-19munity-based services for elderly individuals and 20adults with physical disabilities while 1⁄2of the 21States spent less than 25 percent. This disparity 22continues even though, on average, it is estimated 23that Medicaid dollars can support nearly 3 elderly 24individuals and adults with physical disabilities in 25 492 O:\ERN\ERN09C11.xml [file 2 of 9] S.L.C. 
home and community-based services for every indi-1vidual in a nursing home. Although every State has 2chosen to provide certain services under home and 3community-based waivers, these services are un-4evenly available within and across States, and reach 5a small percentage of eligible individuals. 6(b) SENSEOFTHE
SENATE.—It is the sense of the 7Senate that— 8(1) during the 111th session of Congress, Con-9gress should address long-term services and supports 10in a comprehensive way that guarantees elderly and 11disabled individuals the care they need; and 12(2) long term services and supports should be 13made available in the community in addition to in 14institutions. 15Subtitle FŠMedicaid Prescription 16Drug Coverage 17SEC. 2501.
