 iExecutive Summary
Since 2004, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) has conducted the Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS). The EAVS asks all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 

and four U.S. territoriesŠAmerican Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin IslandsŠto 
provide data about the way in which Americans voted in each Federal election. The EAVS is the 
preeminent source of state and local jurisdiction-level election administration data collected 

after each Federal election. It provides policymakers and the public with key information about 

how their democracy functioned in the election. In 2016, only 30 of the 6,467 jurisdictions in the survey did not provide any response.
Turnout: 
Data reported to the EAVS show a total of 140,114,502 citizens who voted in the 
2016 General Election, representing a national turnout rate of 63 percent of the Citizen Voting 
Age Population.Voter Registration:
 Between the close of voter registration for the 2014 election and the 
close of voter registration for the 2016 election, more than 77.5 million voter registration 

applications were received by states. State motor vehicle of˜ces remain the most common 

place where individuals register to vote (32.7 percent of all registrations) but online 

registration (17.4 percent of the total) has increased dramatically over the past four years as a 

source of registrations.
Pre-Election Voting:
 Voting before Election DayŠeither absentee by mail or using in-person 
early votingŠcontinues to be a very popular way to vote. Nationally, 41 percent of all votes 
cast in the 2016 election were cast before Election Day.   
Absentee Voting:
 Absentee voting rates vary dramatically across states, depending on the 
ease with which individuals can cast an absentee ballot in a state. Nationally, 80.1 percent of 

absentee ballots transmitted to voters were returned, and most states reported that over 90 

percent of absentee ballots ﬁreturned and submitted for countingﬂ were ultimately counted in 
the 2016 General Election.  Military and Overseas Voting:
 Members of the uniformed services and their dependents, as 
well as civilians living overseas, receive special protections voting under the Uniformed and 

Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). In 2016, 930,156 UOCAVA ballots were 

transmitted and 68.1 percent of these ballots were returned. 
Precinct and Polling Places:
 Administration of the November 8, 2016, General Election was a massive undertaking. Nationwide, there were 178,217 individual precincts (geographic voting 

areas to which individuals are assigned and that determine the ballot type that voters receive) 
and 116,990 physical polling places (the locations where people can vote on Election Day). In 
addition, jurisdictions operated more than 8,500 early voting locations in the days leading up 

to the election.   iiPoll Workers:
 Recruiting poll workers continues to be a challenge for many jurisdictions: nearly 
half reported that they had a somewhat dif˜cult or very dif˜cult time recruiting poll workers. 

The poll worker population remains skewed toward older Americans, with 24 percent of poll 
workers ages 71 and older and another 32 percent ages 61Œ70.  
Provisional Voting:
 There were 2.5 million provisional ballots cast in 2016, with nearly half of 
those ballots cast in California. Of the provisional ballots cast, 71 percent were counted either 

partially or in full.

  3Introduction Since 2004, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) has conducted the Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS). The EAVS asks all 50 states, the District of Columbia 

and U.S. four territoriesŠAmerican Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin IslandsŠto 
provide data about the way in which Americans voted in each Federal election, and includes 
questions regarding voter registration, absentee voting, voting by individuals covered by the 

Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), provisional voting, election 

technology, poll workers, polling places, and total turnout.
1 The EAVS satis˜es the EAC™s 
requirements under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) to serve as a clearinghouse of election 

data. The sections of the EAVS related to voter registration and UOCAVA voting allow states 

to satisfy their data reporting requirements established by the National Voter Registration Act 
(NVRA) and under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA).
In 2016, 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, 
and the Virgin Islands) submitted and certi˜ed EAVS data. These states and territories are 

comprised of 6,467 jurisdictions, of which 6,437 (99 percent) are included in the 2016 

EAVS data. It is important to note that state and national totals include all jurisdictions for 

which data were available on a given item. Response rates for each section of the survey 
are available in the methodological appendix at the end of this report.
2  Efforts were made 
to maximize the completeness and accuracy of the data reported here. Where possible, 
information missing for a state or jurisdiction was competed using responses to other survey 
items. All such corrections and adjustments are described in the table notes that follow each 
data table.Since 2008, the EAC has also administered the Statutory Overview survey, which asks 
states to report on their election laws, de˜nitions, and procedures. Information from the 

Statutory Overview is included throughout this report to provide context for the quantitative 

administrative data reported in the EAVS. 
Election Administration in the United States
Although the speci˜c procedures and practices of election administration are constantly 

evolving, elections in the United States follow a standard process. As shown in Figure 1, 

elections can be viewed as a cycle: eligible citizens are registered to vote; polling places are 
selected; poll workers are hired; and voting systems are chosen.
In 2016, for about 40 percent of the population, voting started weeks before Election Day, 
as voters either cast absentee ballots by mail or voted early in person. U.S. citizens living 

overseas and members of the uniformed services and their eligible family, whose voting rights 

are protected by UOCAVA, voted early or absentee by mail. On Election Day, registered voters 

cast ballots in polling places from coast to coast. On election night and the days after, ballots 

were tabulated, provisional ballots were adjudicated, post-election audits occurred, the ˜nal 
canvas of votes was conducted, and the election was certi˜ed. 
(Endnotes)1  The Northern Mariana Islands is not included in the EAVS because it did not have representation in Congress at the time HAVA was enacted.
2  Item-level response rates are dif˜cult to calculate because zero, missing, data not available, and not applicable cannot easily be interpreted. Response rates for each survey section include jurisdictions providing valid, non-zero responses to any questions within a section. 
 4Figure 1: The U.S. Election Process
Election administration outcomes and experiences are then used to evaluate the laws and 
procedures used in elections. Often, the successful innovations implemented in one state 
during an election are adopted by other states in subsequent elections. For example, in 2016, 

Utah saw a marked increase in votes cast by absentee ballot because the state adopted laws 

and procedures that encouraged counties to administer their election using all by-mail voting, 

as had been done previously by other states. 
 5Overall Turnout in 2016
When assessing election administration, one primary outcome of interest is turnout. In this 
report, two different approaches are used to measure voter turnout. The ˜rst method is 

to compare the number of Americans who voted as a percentage of the civilian voting age 
population (CVAP). According to the EAVS, 140,114,502 Americans voted in the 2016 General 
Election. This number represents 63 percent of the CVAP nationally. The data in Figure 2 show 

that approximately half of all states had turnout rates between 60 and 70 percent of CVAP. 

Five statesŠOregon, Maine, New Hampshire, Minnesota, and ColoradoŠhad CVAP turnout 

rates of more than 70 percent.
Figure 2. Turnout as Percentage of CVAP, 2016
 6Registering to Vote
Beginning in the 1800s, most states have required individuals to register to vote before they 
can participate in an election. Today, every state except North Dakota has voter registration. 

In most states, the deadline for registering to vote is within a few weeks of Election Day. 
However, 15 states allow individuals to register to vote at the polls on Election Day: Colorado, 
Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, 

New Hampshire, North Carolina, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Seven additional states 

reported allowing some form of Same Day Registration (SDR).
3In almost all states, the processes for maintaining voter registration rolls and the standard 

ways by which individuals can register to vote are governed by the NVRA
4, which created 
uniform requirements for the locations where individuals should be able to register to vote. It 

also established the process by which states maintain their voter registration rolls. 
There are 38 states that differentiate their registered voters as ﬁactiveﬂ and ﬁinactiveﬂ voters.
 An inactive voter is typically a person who appears to have moved outside of the jurisdiction 
but has not responded to a con˜rmation of address notice. With proper noti˜cation, a state 
can remove a person from the voter registration rolls if the registrant dies, requests to be 

removed, or moves outside of the jurisdiction where he or she was registered. Individuals 

who do not respond to a con˜rmation of address notice and then do not vote in two or more 

consecutive Federal general elections can also be removed from the rolls. If state law allows, 
individuals can be removed based on a ˜nding of mental incapacity, or upon a criminal 
conviction. Detailed information about state laws and registration processes can be found in 

the Statutory Overview report and the NVRA report.
5How Americans Register to Vote
The EAVS asks states to report the number of registration forms that they received and the 

source of these registrations. Several speci˜c methods for voter registration are examined:
1. In-Person Registration. This mode of registration occurs at different places, including 

the state motor vehicle agencies, public assistance and disability of˜ces, armed forces 

recruitment of˜ces, other state-funded agencies, and agencies mandated by state law 
but not explicitly listed in the NVRA.2. Mail, Email, or Fax. These methods allow individuals to use either a federal or state registration formŠa printed copy or a version downloaded from the InternetŠand 

return it to their state or local election of˜ces to be processed.
3. Online Voter Registration
. There are differences on the process used for this type of 

registration across states but, in general, this method allows voters to complete a 

form online and submit it electronically to be evaluated by election of˜cials. An online 
registrant typically has to have a valid driver™s license from the state in which they want 
to register online; the driver™s license is used as part of the process of verifying the 

person™s identity. 
 74. Same Day Voter Registration.
 This option allows a person to register to vote and cast a 
ballot on the same day. SDR is governed by state laws and is allowed statewide in 15 

states. Alaska and Rhode Island only allow SDR in Presidential elections.
5. Automatic Registration: The state of Oregon approved a law to implement a new 

motor voter act starting on January 1, 2016. Unlike registration in other states and 

territories, Oregon™s registration program uses an opt-out instead of opt-in. This opt-in 
rule means that, when Oregonians who meet eligibility criteria for registering to vote 
use the services of designated state of˜ces (e.g., motor vehicle department), they are 

automatically registered to vote without the need of completing an application.
Figure 3 shows the percentage of voter registration applications for the 2016 General Election 

that came from various sources. The most common source of registrations across the country 

was from departments of motor vehicles (DMV), representing more than 25 million new 

registration applications received. Online registration continued to grow in popularity, with 13.5 
million new applications received in 2016; mail, email, and fax combined accounted for 13.4 
million new applications over this same period. Online registration has grown at a fast pace: 

it accounted for 17.4 percent of new registrations for the 2016 election, compared to 6.5 

percent in 2014 and 5.3 percent in 2012.
Figure 3. Source of New Voter Registration Forms, 2016
Poll Book Technology
When voters go into polling places, their identity is checked against the voter registration rolls 
to ensure that they are registered to vote and did not already vote during in-person early voting 

or by-mail absentee voting.6 Most jurisdictions across the United States (81.8 percent) use 
preprinted paper registration lists to check in voters at the polls. In 89 percent of jurisdictions 

that only use paper lists, the local jurisdiction prints the poll books.
7 8From 2012 to 2016, there was a 75 percent increase nationally in the use of electronic poll 
books in elections. In 2012, 645 jurisdictionsŠ7.9 percent of all jurisdictions nationallyŠ

reported using e-poll books to sign in voters. By 2016, 1,146 jurisdictionsŠ17.7 percent of 
all jurisdictionsŠused e-poll books and 1,109 jurisdictions used them to sign in voters at 
the polls. Some of these jurisdictions used e-poll books to update voter history and to locate 

polling places. Figure 4 illustrates how jurisdictions with e-poll books use them to facilitate 

management of the electoral process.
Figure 4. Electronic Poll Book Uses by Jurisdictions, 2016
8Pre-Election Voting 
Over the past 20 years, the number of voters casting ballots using by-mail absentee and in-
person early voting has increased dramatically. More states have adopted these modes of 

voting in an effort to make voting more convenient, and voters are taking advantage of these 
new options for voting. By-mail absentee voting allows individuals to receive their ballot in the 
mail before the election and then mark their ballot at their leisure. The voter typically puts 

his or her marked ballot in an envelope and then mails it to his or her local election of˜ce or 

places it in an absentee ballot drop-off box. In-person early votingŠwhich some states refer 

to as in-person absentee votingŠallows a person to have the same experience voting as 
they would if they voted on Election Day. The voter typically votes on the same type of voting 

equipment as they would on Election Day, but does so during the weeks leading up to Election 

Day.
In 2016, 41.3 percent of all ballots were cast before Election Day. Of the total turnout, 17.2 
percent of ballots were cast using in-person early voting and 23.7 percent were cast using by-

mail absentee voting.9  9Absentee Voting 
By-mail absentee voting was developed to allow individuals who would be away from their 
polling place on Election Day to receive and return a ballot early, so they could still participate 

in the election. Originally, voters usually had to provide a valid reason why they would not be 
present on Election Day (e.g., they would be away on travel or be physically unable to get to the 
polls). Today, there are generally ˜ve types of absentee voter pro˜les in the United States. 
1. Excuse-Required
: These states require voters to provide the reason for why they cannot 

vote in person on Election Day (e.g., will be absent from the county, have an illness, or 

have a physical disability).2. No Excuse: This is the most common form of absentee voting. In these states, 

registered voters can vote absentee after they request an absentee ballot.
3. Permanent Absentee
: Some states have a permanent absentee voter list. Voters who 

request to be a permanent absentee voter receive a ballot by mail for every election, 

without the need to request one for each election.
4. All Vote-by-Mail
: In these states, every voter receives a ballot by mail before the 

election. However, all three of the states that currently have vote-by-mail systems 

(Colorado, Oregon, and Washington) also provide voters the option to cast a ballot in 
person.5. UOCAVA
: Members of the uniformed services, their family, and overseas citizens voting 
from abroad can vote absentee using special procedures outlined in the UOCAVA 

statute and its amendments. As seen in Figure 5, a greater percentage of by-mail absentee ballots are cast in the western 
United States. Colorado, Oregon, and Washington have the highest rates of by-mail voting 
because of their all vote-by-mail election systems. Colorado, which is the most recent state to 

transition to all vote-by-mail, provides more in-person options than does Oregon, which adopted 

vote-by-mail more than 20 years ago. In 2016, Utah began a move to the model used by 

Colorado and the policy change led to a dramatic increase in the number of ballots cast either 

early or as absentee. California also continues to be a national leader in by-mail voting, with 
absentee ballots representing more than 50 percent of the total ballots cast there. 
 10Figure 5. Absentee Voting Rate, 2016
10Nationally, by-mail voting constituted 23.7 percent of all votes cast in the 2016 election. 
Approximately 80.1 percent of absentee ballots that were transmitted to voters were returned 
and processed, with 1.4 percent of transmitted ballots returned as undeliverable and 2 

percent reported as spoiled (e.g., the voter returned the ballot and asked for a replacement). 
Ninety-nine percent of absentee ballots categorized as ﬁreturned and submitted for countingﬂ 
were ultimately counted in the 2016 election. Table 1 provides information about the reasons 
for rejecting a ballot as reported by the states and territories. The most common reasons 

for rejection in 2016 were missing the deadline, the signature on the ballot not matching the 

signature on the state™s records, and the ballot not having a signature. Some of the categories 

include several reasons for ballot rejection. For example, the category ﬁproblem with return 
envelopeﬂ covers reasons such as the envelope was returned but was missing the ballot or 
multiple ballots were returned in one envelope. The category labeled as ﬁOtherﬂ encompasses 

additional reasons not listed in the EAVS questionnaire, and included responses such as the 

ballot was not properly notarized, the voter had already cast an absentee ballot, or there was 

incomplete information on the ballot envelope. In 2016, there were seven states that did not 

report the reasons why absentee ballots are rejected, which leaves an incomplete picture of 
why those ballots were not counted.

1.1%UOCAVA Voting 
Convenience votingŠby-mail absentee voting and in-person early votingŠwas originally developed to facilitate voting by individuals in the military.
11 The special needs of members of the uniformed services and overseas citizens remain an area of critical concern in election 

administration. These individuals are given special voting protections under the UOCAVA and its 
amendments.12  UOCAVA voters are able to vote absentee and are given special considerations 
as to when their ballots are sent to them and how blank ballots can be transmitted to them.
13In 2016, states reported transmitting 930,156 UOCAVA ballots. Six statesŠCalifornia, 
Florida, Texas, Washington, New York, and ColoradoŠaccounted for nearly half of all UOCAVA 

ballots transmitted in the United States. As seen in Figure 6, the number of UOCAVA ballots 
transmitted to voters was similar in 2012 and 2016, but there was a shift between the two 
elections in the percentage of requests coming from uniformed services voters and overseas 
citizens. In 2012, there were 63,842 more ballots transmitted to members of the uniformed 
services than to overseas civilians. In 2016, 109,951 more ballots were transmitted to 

overseas citizens than to uniformed services voters.
 12Figure 6. UOCAVA Ballots Transmitted to Voters, 2016
Once a ballot is marked by a voter, it must be returned to the appropriate election of˜ce 
before the state deadline for receiving UOCAVA
 ballots. This action can be a challenge for some voters, depending on when they receive their ballot, how they are able to return their 

ballot, and the location from which they are casting their ballot. In the 2016 election, 633,592 
UOCAVA ballots were returned. A majority of ballots returned were state ballots that had been 
transmitted to the voter by the election of˜ce.14 Of the UOCAVA ballots returned by voters, 
512,696 (80.9 percent) were counted.  
Early Voting
The EAC considers early voting to be any in-person voting that occurs prior to Election Day at 
a physical polling location or vote center. This early voting 
includes in-person absentee voting. 
In the 2016 election, early voting made up more than 60 percent of the total votes cast in 
Arizona, Florida, Montana, North Carolina, Nevada, Oregon, and Texas. 
The rates of early voting vary greatly across states because some states do not allow for 
in-person early voting and, in states with early voting, local jurisdictions within states may 

differ in number of early voting locations they establish. For the 2016 Federal election, there 

were, on average, 6.1 early voting sites per 100,000 voters; however, the number of early 

voting locations per voter may vary based on the size of the jurisdiction and whether multiple 

locations are warranted based on past voting patterns. 
 13Election Day Voting 
Conducting an election is a complex undertaking. In the United States, Federal elections must 
be held on the ˜rst Tuesday after the ˜rst Monday in November in every even-numbered year. 

Election administrators must select polling locations and voting systems for Election Day, and 
then hire and train poll workers to manage the process. In spite of the increasing popularity 
of pre-Election Day voting methods, Election Day voting still remains the most popular voting 

method for citizens of the United States.Precincts and Polling Places
For an election, each voter is assigned to a precinct, which is a bounded geographic area 

where all individuals are eligible to vote for the same candidates and issues on a ballot. Voters 

are typically also assigned to a polling place, which is the physical location where voting takes 
place. There can be multiple precincts in a polling place. Among states providing information 
about Election Day activities in 2016, there were 178,217 precincts and 116,990 physical 

polling places. Of these polling places, 7.1 percent were election of˜ces and 92.9 percent 

were other locations, such as schools, community centers, and libraries. For early voting, 

states reported that election of˜ces were the primary location used; 5,069 election of˜ces 

were open for early voting compared to 3,547 satellite locations.
Poll Workers
Election Day voting activities are carried out largely by election poll workers who are trained 

to work on a single day and are tasked with coordinating an array of activities. The term ﬁpoll 

workerﬂ encompasses many different names across the United States. Poll workers may be 
referred to as election judges, booth workers, wardens, commissioners, or other similar terms. 
As de˜ned in this report, ﬁpoll workerﬂ refers to the person or persons who do any of the 

following:verify the identity of a voter; assist the voter with signing the register, af˜davits, or other documents required to cast 

a ballot; assist the voter by providing a ballot or setting up the voting machine; or 
serve other functions as dictated by state law. 
Staf˜ng the nation™s polling places continues to be a challenge for many jurisdictions: 46.9 
percent of responding jurisdictions reported having a somewhat dif˜cult or very dif˜cult time 
recruiting poll workers, compared with 22.7 percent that reported having a somewhat easy or 
very easy time. States and territories reported deploying an average of 7.8 poll workers per 

polling place for Election Day 2016.15 This average was similar to that of the last Presidential 
election in 2012, when jurisdictions reported having 7.4 workers per polling site. 
 14Figure 7. Distribution of Poll Worker Ages
Jurisdictions were asked to report the age of their poll workers across six age categories. As 
shown in Figure 7, most poll workers are over age 40, with more than half over age 60 and 
24 percent aged 71 or older. Young poll workers are relatively rare: only 17.8 percent of poll 

workers were 40 years old or younger in the 2016 election. A similar age distribution was 
observed in 2012.
Voting Technology
Since the 1960s or early 1970s, most ballots in the United States have been counted using 
computerized tabulators. Direct recording electronic (DRE) voting machinesŠwhich often have 

touchscreensŠhave been used since the late 1980s. Voting technology continues to advance 
in the United States. With the enactment of HAVA, Congress appropriated more than $3.1 
billion for EAC to distribute to states to make election administration improvements, including 

the purchase of voting systems. Now the EAC works to ensure standards are met by certifying 

election equipment to protect the integrity and security of elections.
Voting technology is a dif˜cult topic to measure in the EAVS because many jurisdictions use 
multiple systems. For example, a county may employ a scanner for absentee ballots but DRE 
machines for in-person voting. Polling places may have more than one type of voting system 
technology in use on Election Day. For this reason, the EAVS survey measures the breadth 
of voting technology being used across the country, and the wealth of local-level data is of 

substantial value to researchers.
 15The 2016 survey collected data on the different voting systems used. The primary three 
systems used in the states are:
1. DRE Voting Machines
: A voting system (push-button or touchscreen) that records votes 

by means of a ballot display provided with mechanical or electro-optical components 

activated by the voter and in which voting data are stored in a removable memory 
component. Many DREs also record voting data on a paper document that the voter can 
review before of˜cially casting his or her ballot.
2. Optical Scan: These systems count paper ballots by recording the marks in the 

response ˜elds on the ballot cards using an optical scanner or similar sensor. 
3. Hybrid Voting Machines
: A hybrid system combines aspects of DREs and optical scan 
voting. The voting interface for selecting votes is similar to that of a DRE: the voter 

uses buttons or a touchscreen to select choices, and then the choices are printed on 
a paper ballot and scanned using an optical scanner. No voting data are stored in the 
system. Table 2 shows the number of jurisdictions that reported using various types of voting systems 

in 2016.Table 2. Types of Voting Machines Used, 2016

Optical Scan2,74542.5%Hybrid1,41921.9%DRE1,34520.8%Other99215.3%Casting and Counting Provisional Ballots
One key provision of HAVA is provisional voting. When an individual declares that he or she 

is a registered voter in the jurisdiction and is eligible to vote in an election for Federal of˜ce, 

but either (1) the individual™s name does not appear on the of˜cial list of eligible voters for 
the polling place, or (2) an election of˜cial asserts that the individual is not eligible to vote, 
the voter can cast a provisional ballot. A provisional ballot is used to record the vote of a 
provisional voter. Once voted, provisional ballots are kept separate from other ballots and are 

not tabulated until the eligibility of the voter is con˜rmed.
When HAVA was enacted, six statesŠIdaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, 
Wisconsin, and WyomingŠwere exempt from provisional voting requirements. In 2016, two 

of these statesŠWisconsin and WyomingŠdid have provisional voters because the voter 
did not have correct identi˜cation (Wisconsin) or was challenged (Wyoming). The primary way 
 16that states vary in regard to provisional voting is whether they allow a provisional ballot to be 
counted if the voter casts a ballot in the correct local jurisdiction but not in the voting precinct 

associated with his or her residence.
In 2016, 2,460,421 provisional ballots were cast nationally and 71.1 percent of these ballots 
were counted in full or in part.
17 Four statesŠArizona, California, New York, and OhioŠeach 
reported that more than 100,000 provisional ballots were cast in the 2016 election; California 
had just over 1.3 million provisional ballots cast, more than all other states combined. All 
four of these states also allowed a ballot that was cast by a voter in the wrong precinct to 
be counted, either partially or in full.
18 In similar large states that do not allow provisional 
ballots to be counted if the voter is not casting it in the correct precinctŠsuch as Florida, 

Illinois, and TexasŠa comparatively smaller number of provisional ballots were cast and a 
higher percentage of provisional ballots were rejected. In addition to the four states that do 
not provide for provisional voting, 12 states and territories reported having fewer than 1,000 

provisional ballots cast in 2016.

applicable cannot easily be interpreted. Response rates for each survey section include jurisdictions providing 
valid, non-zero responses to any questions within a section. 
3  Arizona reported that its same day registrants were likely UOCAVA registrants. Texas reported that its 
same day registrants were either the result of misreporting or of localities implementing certain policies 

inappropriately.
4  The NVRA was fully implemented after the 1994 election in all states. Several states are not covered by 
the NVRA. North Dakota is exempt because it does not have voter registration. U.S. territories are also not 

subject to the NVRA, and the states of Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Wyoming are 

exempt because they had SDR in 1994 and continue to do so.5  The Impact of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 on the Administration of Elections for Federal 
Of˜ce, 2015Œ2016, is available on EAC™s website (https://www.eac.gov/voters/national-voter-registration-act-

studies/).6  North Dakota does not require voters to register but rather keeps a registry of citizens who voted in the past 
and in that election.7  The printing of poll books was completed by the state shipped to local jurisdictions 6.8 percent of the time 
and 1.5 percent of jurisdictions reported that they used a mix of the two methods; 2.7 percent of jurisdictions 

reported that information was unavailable.
8  There is some overlap in the number of Electronic Poll Books used for each of the reported categories, as 
some jurisdictions use the same Electronic Poll Book for several purposes.
9  The percentages are based on data reported by 50 states and territories. Alabama, Iowa, Utah, and 
Vermont did not provide information about the number of citizens casting absentee ballots or voting at an 

early voting center.
10  The absentee voting rate includes all UOCAVA ballots, domestic civilian absentee ballots, and vote-by-mail 
ballots, as reported in questions F1c, F1d and F1g, respectively.
11  See, for example, R. Michael Alvarez, Thad E. Hall, and Brian F. Roberts. (2007). Military voting and the 
law: procedural and technological solutions to the ballot transit problem. 
Fordham Urban Law Journal,
 34, 935. 12  Since 2004, EAC has gathered data on UOCAVA ballots and voters, pursuant to the statutory reporting 
obligations in UOCAVA and HAVA. In the 2016 survey, 18 questions sought to gather detailed information on 

overseas voting. What is presented in this section is explained in more detail in the 2016 Uniformed and 

Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act Survey Observations Report, available at EAC™s website, 
www.eac.gov
. Improved data collection of UOCAVA-related information resulted in high response rates in 2016 and more 

jurisdictions responding overall to this portion of the survey than in previous years. Although gaps remain, 

better data are gradually becoming available on UOCAVA voting.
13  The uniformed services are the armed forcesŠArmy, Navy, Marine Corps and Air ForceŠas well as the 
Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 

and the U.S. Merchant Marine. Uniformed service members, their spouses, and their dependents are, 

together, referred to as uniformed services voters. Overseas citizens are U.S. citizens living outside of the 

United States who are not uniformed services voters and are also protected by UOCAVA.
 1814  UOCAVA voters can also cast a Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot (FWAB). Information about those ballots is 
discussed in some detail in the UOCAVA EAVS report.
15  Only Oregon and Massachusetts did not provide information about number of poll workers, and Iowa did not 
report number of physical polling places for the 2016 Presidential Election.
16  Some jurisdictions may have used more than one voting system, thus, the percentages may have some 
degree of overlap between jurisdictions.
17  Of the 1,748,883 provisional ballots that were counted, 87.7% of them were counted in full.  
18  Ballots are typically counted for all races for which the voter would have been eligible.

General comment: negative numbers in the column ﬁOtherﬂ, mean that the sum of counted and rejected absentee ballots account for more than the total number 
of returned absentee ballots reported by the state.
Connecticut: misinterpreted the item ﬁReturned for countingﬂ (C1b) and added only those ballots that were counted (item C4a). Item C1b was re-recorded using the 
sum of counted and rejected absentee ballots (C4a and C4b)
Hawaii: Hawaii County did not report the number of absentee ballots returned by voters (item C1b). This was re-recorded using the sum of counted and rejected 
absentee ballots by that county (items C4a to C4d).Texas:
 Hidalgo County and Dallas County either not reported or reported a very small number that did not match the expected number of absentee ballots returned 
by voters (item C1b). This was re-recorded using the sum of counted and rejected absentee ballots by those counties (items C4a to C4d).
Vermont:
 did not provide data about absentee ballots returned.

West Virginia:
 all jurisdictions reported more absentee ballots counted (item C4a) than received back (item C1b).

  37IntroductionVoter registration is perhaps the most complex aspect of election administration. Once the 
rules have been established regarding who is eligible to voteŠin the United States, this 

is typically all citizens who are ages 18 and older who are not convicted felons or currently 
incarceratedŠthere has to be a process for ensuring that only eligible individuals vote and that 
each person only votes once. Voter registration is the process by which a person™s eligibility 

to vote is con˜rmed and his or her place of residence is established. Voter registration also 

serves to assign each voter to a precinctŠa geographic area where all individuals are eligible 
to vote for the same candidates and issues on a ballotŠso that he or she receives the correct 
ballot in the election. The voter registration system tracks each voter™s electoral participation 
so that an individual can be given credit for voting in an election, which ensures each person 
casts only one ballot per election.Figure 1: The Registration Process

Registration Act (NVRA). In the NVRA, Congress provides a clear statement regarding the 

importance of voter registration. Speci˜cally, Congress ˜nds that:
(1) the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right; 
(2) it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local governments to promote the exercise 
of that right; and (3) discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can have a direct 
and damaging effect on voter participation in elections for Federal of˜ce and 

disproportionately harm voter participation by various groups, including racial 

minorities.1The primary purposes of the NVRA are: 
(1) to establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who 

register to vote in elections for Federal of˜ce; 
(2) to make it possible for Federal, State, and local governments to implement [the 
NVRA] in a manner that enhances the participation of eligible citizens as voters in 
elections for Federal of˜ce; (3) to protect the integrity of the electoral process; and 

(4) to ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.
The NVRA was fully implemented after the 1994 election in all states. Several states are not covered by the NVRA. North Dakota is exempt because it does not have voter 

registration. U.S. territories are also not subject to the NVRA, and the states of Idaho, 

Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Wyoming are exempt because they had Same 

Day Registration (SDR) in 1994 and continue to make this option available.The Registration Process The NVRA™s ˜rst purpose is to expand opportunities for voters to register by creating more 
uniform processes for voter registration and designating more places as voter registration 

agencies. The NVRA requires states and territories to allow people to register to vote through 
four venues: (1) at the state department of motor vehicles (DMV) when a person obtains or 
renews his or her driver™s license, (2) through the mail, using a standard registration form, (3) 

at all of˜ces for state public assistance agencies, and (4) at all of˜ces or agencies that provide 

services to people with disabilities. In addition, states can, at their discretion, designate other 

of˜cesŠlibraries, public schools and universitiesŠas voter registration agencies.
 39When a person registers to vote, the state checks the registration form to ensure that the 
individual is eligible to vote. This process typically involves requiring the person to demonstrate 

proof of identity and proof of residency. Once the person proves his or her eligibility, he or she 
is added to the voter registration rolls. 
Every person with a valid registration is considered an active, registered voter. However, at 
times, a question arises as to whether a person is still living at the residence where he or she 

is registered to vote. When such situations arise, the state or local election of˜ce will send 

the registrant a con˜rmation of address notice. In many states, if the person fails to return the 

form or the form is returned undeliverable, he or she is placed on a list of inactive voters.
Inactive voters are still part of the voter registration rolls and they are allowed to vote in most 
jurisdictions.2 However, before they can vote, inactive voters are typically required to show 
approved documentation of their eligibility, most commonly proof that they still reside at the 

address where they registered to vote. In some cases, inactive voters may have to cast a 
provisional ballot when their eligibility cannot be established at the polls on Election Day.  
The NVRA also requires list maintenance. For example, if a registrant fails to return the 
con˜rmation notice and does not vote in two subsequent Federal elections, he or she might be 

removed from the registration rolls of a particular jurisdiction. In addition, registrants can be 

removed for other reasons like death, request by the registrant to be removed from registration 

rolls, or due to criminal conviction or mental incompetence as provided by a state™s laws. 
Registration Rates
The NVRA requires each state and territory to report its number of ﬁregistered and eligibleﬂ 

voters, as well as the total active and inactive voters, to the EAC. The way in which the number 

of registered voters is reported differs by state. Most states report the number of ﬁregistered 
and eligibleﬂ voters as the sum of active and inactive voters. Some states consider only active 
voters as registered but may separately provide information about voters on the inactive list. 

In some states, local jurisdictions within a state differ in how they report registration. These 

distinctions are important to recognize when interpreting EAVS data on voter registration.  
For the 2016 Presidential election, states reported that 214,109,360 citizens were registered 
to vote.3 This represents a 10.6 percent increase in registered voters compared with the 2012 
Presidential election. Nationally, 86.7 percent of all registrants are considered active voters, 

and 8.7 percent are on an inactive voter registration list.
4 40Figure 2. Percentage of Active and Inactive Voters per State
5 41Sources of RegistrationsBetween 2014 and 2016, U.S. states and territories reported receiving a total of 77,516,592 
registration applications.
6 NVRA requires states to provide several options for registering to 
vote. As reported in Table 1, the DMV was the most common source of registration for the 

2016 Presidential election. The four major sources of registrationŠDMV, mail, in person, and 
onlineŠaccounted for nearly 80 percent of registrations. The remaining applications were from 
sources such as registration drives by political parties (3.4 percent), agencies designated by 

each particular state (2.1 percent), and Armed Forces recruiting of˜ces (0.1 percent), among 
others.Table 1. Registrations Received by Source of Registration

election with those used in previous election years, a few differences stand out. First, 

internet applications constituted only 6.5 percent total registrations in the 2014 election, 
but accounted for 17.4 percent of registrations in the 2016 Presidential election. Since its 
inception, the act of registering to vote online has grown in popularity as it has been adopted 

by more states. The DMV still receives the most registration applications (32.7 percent), but 

other registration methods, like mail and in person registration, have declined in use since the 

2012 Presidential election. Figure 3 shows the percentage of registration forms from various 

sources for the previous three Federal election cycles.
A good example of a state whose registration numbers track the national registration trend is 
Kansas (NVRA Table 2a). The largest percentages of registration forms came from the DMV 
(39.2 percent), mail (14 percent), in person (11.6 percent), and the internet (19.9 percent, 

nearly double the previous Presidential election).

Although Kansas is an example of a typical state when it comes to voter registration, several 
states have very different patterns of registration. For example, Mississippi reported receiving 

most of its registrations in person (44.7 percent) and by mail (32.5 percent), with DMV 
applications representing just 11.1 percent of the total (less than half the national average). In 
Nevada (24.3 percent) and Colorado (12.6 percent), the rate of registrations coming from voter 

registration drives and political parties was more than three times higher than the national 

average (3.4 percent). The data in these two states suggest that political parties and other 

organizations are more active in collecting registration applications from citizens, reducing 

the percentage of registrations coming from other popular application methods, like mail or in 
person registration.
Voter Registration Forms Processed
There are several reasons why citizens decide to complete the registration process, such as 
registering for the ˜rst time in a jurisdiction, change of address, change of name, or change 

of party af˜liation. States and territories were asked to report on the types of applications 
they processed from each of the available sources during the 2016 election cycle (Figure 4). 
These data show that only 37.3 percent of voter registration forms processed nationally were 

new, valid registrations. Most valid registrations that are processed are changes to existing 

registrations; for example, changes of address within a jurisdiction (39.7 percent). In 2016, 

cross-jurisdiction changes of address accounted for 5.9 percent of applications. Some states 

also allowed citizens who turned 18 years old before or on Election Day to pre-register so 
that they could vote in the general election, but these pre-registrations only accounted for 
0.5 percent of registrations in the 33 states and territories that reported having this type of 
 43registration. Combined, duplicate and invalid registrations constituted 10.3 percent of the total 
applications received.
Figure 4. Percentage of Applications by Outcome
Valid, Rejected, and Duplicate Registration Forms 
Although millions of registration forms are received each year, not all of them are accepted. 
Once the registration applications are received, the election of˜cials from the corresponding 

jurisdiction examine the application and decide whether or not the citizen meets eligibility requirements. States and territories reported processing 77,516,596 applications, 83.4 
percent of which were accepted by election of˜cials.
7Almost 8 million registration applications for the 2016 Presidential election were not 

accepted as valid (10.3 percent of the total registrations received).
8 This is a decrease of 
about 700,000 compared to the 2012 Presidential election, when 13.9 percent of the total 

registration applications were not valid. The reasons to categorize a registration as not 
valid were that either (1) the registration was a duplicate (registrant already submitted an 
application or was registered in the jurisdiction), or (2) the registration was rejected by the 

election of˜cials for not complying with eligibility rules.
9Figure 5 shows the registration sources that accounted for the most rejected and duplicate 

registrations in 2016. Motor vehicle of˜ces were responsible for 32.1 percent of all new valid 

registrations and only 14.9 percent of invalid registrations. However, one-third of all duplicate 
registrations originate from a DMV. The high percentage of duplicate registrations originating 
from a DMV suggests that many are not able to see in real time if a person is already 

registered to vote at a given address and are processing applications for individuals who are 

already registered in a jurisdiction.

Online voter registration also has a low percentage of invalid registrations (8.2 percent) 
compared to its percentage of valid registrations (15 percent). However, as is the case with 

state DMVs, many online voter registration systems do not seem to inform registered voters 
that they already have a valid registration. In person and mail registrations show similar 
rates between valid, invalid, and duplicate registration processed. Sources of registration 

categorized as ﬁOtherﬂ accounted for about 10 percent of the total new valid registrations and 

for one-quarter of the invalid registrations in 2016. However, ﬁOtherﬂ encompassed several 

sources and modes of registration, which showed differing rates of invalid registrations (see 

NVRA Table 2d). 
It is important to note that each state has its own particularities related to voter registration 
rejection and duplicate rates, making it dif˜cult to assess national-level rates by registration 

source. In some cases, a state did not use a certain mode of registration (e.g., online 

registration) in 2016. In other cases, a state did not classify the source of duplicate and 

rejected applications, making it dif˜cult to track trends in invalid or duplicate registration 

applications.10  45Figure 6. Percentage of Rejected and Duplicate Registrations
Figure 6 provides information about the percentage of rejected and duplicate registrations in 
each state. It shows that South Dakota (29.9 percent) and Kentucky (32 percent) reported the 

highest percentages of duplicate and rejected registrations. Less than one percent of voter 
registrations in Missouri and Maryland were rejected or had duplicates, and Arkansas and New 
Hampshire reported that less than 0.2 percent of the registrations processed were duplicates. 
List MaintenanceOne of the NVRA™s goals is to ensure that voter registration lists are accurate and current. 

In order to facilitate this maintenance, NVRA requires that any change of address submitted 

to a motor vehicle driver™s license agency serve as noti˜cation of a change of address 
for voter registration, unless the individual indicates that the change is not for voter 
registration purposes.
11 The law also requires states and territories to conduct a uniform and 
nondiscriminatory general program to remove the names of ineligible voters.
12 However, states 
and territories have considerable freedom to choose when, where, and how these functions 

are performed. 
 46According to Section 8 of the NVRA, States can only remove registrants from rolls for the 
following reasons:
upon the death of the registrant;
upon the registrant™s written con˜rmation that his or her address has changed to a 

location outside the registrar™s jurisdiction;
on the registrant™s failure to respond to certain con˜rmation mailings along with 

failure to appear to vote in two consecutive Federal general elections subsequent to 

the mailing;on the request of the registrant;
for mental incapacity of the registrant, as provided for in state law; and
on criminal conviction of the registrant, as provided for in state law.

A central part of voter registration list maintenance is the use of con˜rmation notices. When a 
state or territory has evidence that a registrant has moved outside the registrar™s jurisdiction, 

the state or local election of˜ce is required to start a process of address con˜rmation. This 
process begins by sending a con˜rmation notice by mail to the individual, which contains a 
postage-prepaid and pre-addressed return card so that the registrant can con˜rm his or her 

current address. If the registrant fails to return the completed con˜rmation notice before the 

registration deadline, the person can be asked to provide proof of address when attempting 

to vote in a Federal election. If the registrant does not to vote in either of the two Federal 

elections after failing to return the con˜rmation notice, this person can be removed from the 
registration rolls.
The 47 states and territories that responded to this section of the EAVS survey reported 
sending a total of 19,058,066 con˜rmation notices to registrants during the 2016 election 

cycle (NVRA Table 4a).
13 This represents a 1.5 million increase compared to the number of 
con˜rmation notices sent in the period leading to the 2012 Presidential election. However, only 

41 states reported data about this matter in 2012.
The response rate by registrants to con˜rmation notices nationwide was 12.8 percent. 
Alabama and Maryland reported response rates of only 0.7 percent and 1.2 percent, 
respectively, whereas Connecticut and South Carolina reported receiving more than 70 percent 

of con˜rmation notices back from registrants (see NVRA Table 4a).
 47
More than 3 million con˜rmation notices were either returned as undeliverable or the response 
to the con˜rmation notice was deemed invalid by election of˜cials. However, most con˜rmation 
notices were categorized as ﬁstatus unknownﬂ (47 percent, indicating that notices were neither 

returned as undeliverable nor received back from the registrant [Figure 7]). Some states like 
Arizona (48.2 percent) and South Dakota (57.1 percent) reported having more con˜rmation 
notices returned back as undeliverable than they did in the status unknown category. A total of 

18 states and territories did not report the status of con˜rmation notices.
14Removal from Voter Rolls
With the implementation of the NVRA in 1994, states are required to have evidence that a 

citizen is no longer living in the jurisdiction where they were registered before removing him 

or her from the registration rolls. From 2014 to 2016, 16,696,470 citizens (8.8 percent of 
all registrants) were removed from state voter registration rolls (NVRA Table 4b). The number 
of registrants removed from rolls between 2014 and 2016 was 1.9 million greater than in 

the same period leading to the 2014 Federal election (i.e., 2012Œ2014), a 12.8-percent 

increase.
15Most states and territories that provided information about the number of citizens 
removed from registration rolls reported removing between 5 and 10 percent of their 

registered voters. At one end of the spectrum was Indiana, which removed 22.4 percent of its 
registered voters, and at the other extreme was New Mexico, which reported removing only 0.2 
percent of its registered voters.
 48Figure 8. Percentage of Voters Removed from Registration Rolls
The most common reason for a registrant™s removal from the rolls was cross-jurisdiction 
change of address (31.1 percent), followed by the NVRA process of failing to respond to 
a con˜rmation notice and not voting in the following two Federal elections (26.1 percent). 

These two reasons accounted for 9,546,871registrant removals. Although the total number of 
registrants removed from the rolls increased, the reasons for removing voters were similar in 
2016 to what was reported in the 2012 Presidential election. Overall, 4,110,047 registrants 

(24.6 percent) were removed due to death. Felony convictionŠa disquali˜er in most states 

and territoriesŠ was the reason that 334,253 registrants were removed from the rolls during 

the past election cycle, representing only 2 percent of removals. At the state level, however, 

we ˜nd cases like that of New Mexico, which reported that the main reason for removing 
voters from rolls was felony, accounting for 48.5 percent of the 2,993 removals in that state. 
Other reasons for removing voters from the rolls included requests by voters and mental 

incompetence, which accounted for a combined 1.9 percent for the removals at the national 

level.Delaware removed registrants from its registration rolls at a rate similar to the national 
average. It reported that the main reason for removal was cross-jurisdiction change of address 
(38.8 percent) followed by failure to vote and return a certi˜cation notice (30.1 percent) and 
death of the registrant (27 percent). In general, felony and mental incompetency represented 

a small portion of the reason for voter removal in this state (3.7 percent) and at the national 

level (2.1 percent).
 49Figure 9. Reason for Removal from Registration Rolls
State Registration Policies 
Same Day Registration (SDR)
EAC asked states and territories to provide information on voters who register to vote and 
cast their ballots on the same day. Same Day Registration (SDR) depends on local laws and, 

thus, is only allowed in some states and territories. Moreover, those states and territories 
that allow SDR vary widely in the application of this measure. For example, states like Idaho, 
Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Wyoming allow SDR for all citizens of age meeting 

the requirements to register. On the other hand, some states allow SDR only for particular 

elections (e.g., Rhode Island only allows SDR for President and Vice President), or particular 

subsets of the population (e.g., UOCAVA voters, recently discharged from the military). Table 5 

in the Appendix shows the distribution of SDR categories across U.S. states and territories for 
the 2016 Presidential election.
It is also important to note that SDR is de˜ned here as the ability to register to vote on a day 
when it is also possible to cast a ballot. In most cases, Election Day is not the only day that 

citizens are allowed to vote. Many states (e.g., Illinois and Iowa) have an overlap between the 

date when registration closes and the date when early voting starts, so that there are days 

when citizens can both register and cast a ballot.
For the 2016 Presidential election, a total of 1,289,578 voters registered to vote on a day 
when casting a ballot was allowed (1.7 percent of the total registrations were SDR). Twenty-two 
states and territories reported having such voters; however, the number of registrations using 

this method varied widely across states. For example, Idaho reported registering 131,455 

citizens on a voting day (14 percent of the state™s total registrations). Nebraska, which allows 

citizens to register to vote and vote early on the same day during the period between the 

opening of early voting and the close of in-person voter registration, had only 1,237 voters use 
 50SDR (0.1 percent of the state™s total). Among those states that allowed SDR to all citizens, 
those that do not follow the NVRA and have maintained this registration option for decades 

(Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) were among the states that 
reported the highest rates of SDR (Figure 10.)
Figure 10. Percentage of Same Day Registrations (SDR) in non-NVRA States
Internet Registration 
As of January 27, 2017,
 35 states offered online registration; four other states had enacted 
legislation to create online voter registration systems, but had not yet implemented them. 
Online voter registration systems are intended to supplement the traditional paper-based 

process. In general, instead of ˜lling out a paper application, the voter uses a website or 
phone app to complete a form that is then submitted electronically to election of˜cials. 
The review process for those applications completed online follows a series of steps. First, the 
application is reviewed electronically and, if it is valid, the person is added to the state™s voter 

registration list. Typically, the validation process compares the data from the online registration 

form with driver™s license records (or state-issued identi˜cation card records). The driver™s 

license signature becomes the signature on record for voting. If the information does not 

match, the application is reviewed for further action.
16There was a notable increase in the number of online registrations received in the 2016 

election cycle. A total of 13,485,127 registrations was received electronically (17.4 percent 
of the total registrations), a marked growth over the rate in 2012 (5.3 percent). Online 

applications were also rejected at a lower rate, as online applications only accounted for 8.3 
percent of the total registrations deemed invalid. 
 51When looking at the total results for internet registrations received for the 2016 Presidential 
election, Arizona is one of the states where internet registrations account for a large portion 

of the total registrations processed. Arizona reported that 40.5 percent of the registration 
applications they received were from the internet. This report is not surprising considering that 
Arizona was the ˜rst state to implement internet registration in 2002.
Automatic Registration
On January 1, 2016, Oregon became the ˜rst state to implement a program of automatic 

registration. The main difference of this program compared to those in place in the rest of 

states and territories is that Oregon™s registration program now uses an opt-out instead of 
opt-in method. This opt-out rule means that when Oregonians who meet eligibility criteria 
for registering to vote use the services of designated state of˜ces (e.g., motor vehicle 

department),s they are automatically registered to vote without the need to complete an 

application. Once the automatic registration occurs, the Oregon Election Division sends a letter 

to the citizen offering three options:
1. do nothing and remain registered as a non-af˜liated voter;
2. choose a political party by ˜lling and returning an enclosed postcard; or
3. choose to opt out and decline to register to vote by returning an enclosed postcard.
If the voter does not return the enclosed post card to opt out within 21 days, he or she is 

considered as registered to vote. But, if an individual is already registered to vote, no action is 

taken.Since Oregon™s DMV requires proof of legal status in order to issue a driver™s license or ID 
card, the DMV can distinguish between those persons who are U.S. citizens and those who 
provide the information to the Elections Division to add them to the system and send them a 

voter registration mailing.
During the two years leading to the 2016 Presidential election, Oregon has seen a 14-percent 
increase in the number of citizens registered to vote compared to the past two Federal 

elections. The number of citizens registered in the 2012 and 2014 Federal elections was 

about 2.2 million, and it increased to more than 2.5 million for the 2016 Presidential election. 
Data SharingThe Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) is a non-pro˜t corporation governed by 

a board of directors drawn from its 21 member states (including the District of Columbia). 

The goal of ERIC is to assist states in identifying inaccurate or out-of-date voter registration 
records, as well as reach out to eligible but unregistered residents. Members of ERIC submit 
their voter registration and motor vehicle license data, which include names, addresses, date 

of birth, and the last four digits of their social security number. Before personally identi˜able 
 52information (PII) are transmitted to ERIC, these data are anonymized by states in a way in 
which privacy is maintained but which can still be used in the ERIC data-matching process. 
At the end of this matching process, states are provided several reports, including (1) of voters 
who have potentially moved, (2) of voters who have potentially died, and (3) of voters who are 
potentially eligible to vote but are unregistered. States can then begin the process of updating 
problematic voter registrations or encouraging eligible individuals to register to vote. A number 

of states also participate in the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck, which is used to 

identify possible double registrations and double votes.
 53Endnotes
1  52 U.S.C. §205012  Jurisdictions in some states (e.g., Wyoming) do not include inactive voters as ﬁthose people registered and 
eligible to vote.ﬂ3  The states and territories that did not provide information are North Dakota (does not require voters to 
register) and American Samoa (did not complete the EAVS).
4  Not all jurisdictions reported the number of active and inactive voters. Thus, the total number of active and 
inactive voters does not add up to the total registered voters.
5  The sum of active (item A3a) and inactive (item a3b) voters did not equal the total registrants (item A1a) 
reported by AL, LA, and TX. Also, SC reported a number of inactive voters (275,292) even though the state 
does not consider inactive voters as registered and report the same number for active and registered voters 

(3,157,027).6  This number includes both valid and invalid registration applications.
7  Only those registrations in the categories ﬁnew valid registration,ﬂ ﬁchange of addressﬂ (within jurisdiction 
and cross jurisdiction), and ﬁpre-registrationsﬂ are included as valid in this case, as the category ﬁotherﬂ 

contains cases of both valid and invalid registrations.
8  Some jurisdictions did not report if the registration applications they received were valid or not. Thus, the 
sum of valid and not valid applications does not add up the total number of registrations received (about 6 

percent of registrations were not categorized.)
9  The survey did not ask states and territories to provide the reasons for these rejections.
10  The states of KS, NH, and OR did not report the source of invalid registrations, whereas GU, MS, UT, WI, 
and WV did not report the source of duplicate registrations, and CT, ID, PR, RI, SC, VI, and WY did not report 

the source of either duplicated or invalid registrations (ND does not use voter registration).
11  52 U.S.C. §2050112  52 U.S.C. §2050713  There was no information about con˜rmation notice™s use from AS, DC, IN, KY, PR, RI, WI or ND (does not 
have voter registration).
14  DC, IA, ID, IN, KY, LA, MA, MN, MS, NC, NJ, OR, PR, RI, VT, WI, and WY did not provide the status of the 
con˜rmation notices sent. ND does not use con˜rmation notices as they do not require a voter™s registration.
15  Fifty states provided data about voters™ removal from rolls in the 2014Œ2016 period compared to the 48 
states that provided the data for the 2012Œ2014 stretch, thus, accounting for some of the increase in this 

topic. However, the increase was much larger than what could be expected for the addition of the data for two 

states.16  Information retrieved from the National Council of State Legislatures (NCSL),

(1) Year is the election year.
(2) CVAP Total is the estimate Citizen Voting Age Population for the state, taken from the U.S. Census Bureau. 

(3) Reported Registration uses question A1a. 

(4) Reported Registration % of CVAP is calculated using question A1a divided by the state CVAP estimate.

(5) Ranking of % of CVAP ranks states according to the proportion of their CVAP that is registered.

(6) Total Active + Inactive Registrations uses questions A3a and A3b.

(7) Active Registrations (total) uses question A3a.
(8) Active Registrations (% of total) uses question A3a divided by A1a.
(9) Inactive Registrations (total) uses question A3b.
(10) Inactive Registrations (% of total) uses question A3b divided by A1a.NVRA Table 1 Data Notes
General notes: CVAP and calculations using CVAP are not available for U.S. territories. CVAP was taken from U.S. Census Bureau. CVAP is an estimate of the voting 
age population. Thus, percentages higher than 100% in the column ﬁReported registration % of CVAPﬂ mean that the estimate is smaller than the actual number 

of registered citizens. The column ﬁRanking of % of CVAPﬂ reports how each state compares with the rest in terms of percentage of registered citizens compared 

with their CVAP. Those states that did not report registrations or CVAP are not included in the ranking. The U.S. total is calculated by adding the information from 

each state and territory reporting information. Percentages of Active and Inactive registrations may not add up to 100% as they were calculated based on total 

registration reported by each state.
American Samoa, District of Columbia, Florida, Guam, Idaho, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Puerto Rico, 
U.S. Virgin Islands, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming:
 did not provide information about inactive voters at some point between 2008 and 2016. In many 

cases, because the state considers as registered only active voters.
Iowa: reported that:  ﬁA1a [registered voters], A3a [active voters] numbers are of November 1, 2016, and does not include election day registrations.ﬂ This was 
addressed by adding up Same Day Registration data (A4a) to total active voters (A3a) and total registered voters (A1a).
Nebraska: this state reported: ﬁNebraska does not have ﬁinactiveﬂ voters. The numbers in line a3b re˚ect the number of voters who were sent a section 8(d)(2) 
notice and have not responded.ﬂ
North Dakota:
 does not have voter registration.

Pennsylvania: this state reported: ﬁat this time, we cannot differentiate between active and inactive from our point in time snapshot of the voter registration 
numbers.ﬂ 68NVRA Table 2a: Application Sources Œ Total Forms Received

General note: negative numbers in the ﬁNot Categorizedﬂ column mean that the sum of the registrations from each source (items A6a to A6o) add up to more 
registrations than the total applications reported by the state (item A5a). 
Connecticut and Guam: both reported receiving 100% of the registration applications via mail. However, they also broke down the registrations received into the 
other categories, so that the sum of the registrations reported per source accounts for 200% of the total registrations in the state/territory.
Idaho: this state reported that: ﬁThe Idaho statewide voter registration system does not track how the registration forms are received by the county clerks. Also, 
Idaho code did not allow for registration cards to be submitted via the internet or email.
Indiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Minnesota, Montana, Vermont, Virginia and New Jersey:
 reported FPCA applications or by mail NVRA codes as ﬁOtherﬂ (items A6i Œ
A6o). These were re-recorded as ﬁMailﬂ (itemA6a).
Iowa: this state offers online voter registration through the Department of Transportation (DOT)

Kentucky, Maryland and Missouri:
 classi˜ed High Schools or Department of Labor as ﬁOtherﬂ (items A6i ŒA6o). These were re-recorded as ﬁOther state agencies 
non-mandated by NVRAﬂ (itemA6h).Minnesota: recorded ﬁUOCAVA/FPCA online registrationﬂ as ﬁOtherﬂ (item A6m). This was re-recorded as ﬁOnline registrationﬂ (item A6c).

New Mexico: the data for the total registrations and the registrations per channel come from different sources and do not completely match.

North Dakota:
 does not have voter registration.

South Carolina:
 this state reports: ﬁtotal forms received by source include additions and changes that are processed.  System does not allow capture of data on 
duplicates and incomplete formsﬂ
Utah: did not report the source of the registrations received.

West Virginia:
 the data reported for ﬁtotal registrationsﬂ per source is well below the expected and is almost the same as that reported for ﬁnew valid 
registrationsﬂ (NVRA Table 2b)
Wisconsin:
 this state reports: only military voters were able to register by fax, email or internet in Wisconsin during the reporting period.  Wisconsin is exempt from 
NVRA and does not receive registrations from NVRA agencies.
Wyoming:
 forms from voter registration drives were classi˜ed as ﬁOtherﬂ (item A6j). This item was re-recorded as ﬁRegistrations from drivesﬂ (item A6i)

General note: negative numbers in the ﬁNot Categorizedﬂ column mean that the sum of the registrations from each source (items A7a to A7o) add up to more 
registrations than the total valid applications reported by the state (item A5b). 
Connecticut and Guam: both reported receiving about 100% of their new valid registration applications via mail. However, they also broke down the registrations 
received into the other categories, so that the sum of the registrations reported per source accounts for about 200% of the total new registrations in the state/

territory.
Nebraska, Minnesota, Montana, Vermont, Virginia and some jurisdictions in Texas:
 reported FPCA applications as ﬁOtherﬂ (items A7i ŒA7o). These were re-
recorded as ﬁMailﬂ (itemA7a).
Idaho: this state reported that: ﬁThe Idaho statewide voter registration system does not track how the registration forms are received by the county clerks. Also, 
Idaho code did not allow for registration cards to be submitted via the internet or email.
Illinois, New York and Utah:
 these states did not report the registration source for new valid registrations.

Kentucky and Maryland:
 classi˜ed High Schools as ﬁOtherﬂ (items A7i ŒA7o). These were re-recorded as ﬁOther state agencies non-mandated by NVRAﬂ (itemA7h).

Minnesota: recorded ﬁUOCAVA/FPCA online registrationﬂ as ﬁOtherﬂ (item A7m). This was re-recorded as ﬁOnline registrationﬂ (item A7c).

New Mexico: the data for the total new valid registrations and data for the new valid registrations per channel come from different sources and do not completely 
match. For seven jurisdictions, the total number of registrations (item A5a) was ˜lled with the sum of items A5b to A5l. 
North Dakota:
 does not have voter registration.

South Dakota: only a few jurisdictions reported information about source of new valid registrations.

Wisconsin:
 this state reported: ﬁWe cannot pull both the registration type and the registration sourceﬂ

Wyoming:
 forms from voter registration drives were classi˜ed as ﬁOtherﬂ (item A7j). This item was re-recorded as ﬁRegistrations from drivesﬂ (item A7i)

General note: negative numbers in the ﬁNot Categorizedﬂ column mean that the sum of the duplicate registrations from each source (items A8a to A8o) add up to 
more registrations than the total duplicate registrations reported by the state (item A5d).
Connecticut, Guam, Idaho, Mississippi, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, U.S. Virgin Islands, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin:
 did not report any 
duplicate registrations.
Illinois, Kansas and Kentucky: did not break down duplicate registrations per source of registration.

Indiana, Nebraska, Minnesota and Montana: reported FPCA duplicate applications as ﬁOtherﬂ (items A8i ŒA8o). These were re-recorded as ﬁMailﬂ (itemA8a).

Maryland:
 classi˜ed duplicate registrations from High Schools as ﬁOtherﬂ (items A8l). These were re-recorded as ﬁOther state agencies non-mandated by NVRAﬂ 
(itemA8h).Minnesota: recorded ﬁUOCAVA/FPCA online registrationﬂ duplicate registrations as ﬁOtherﬂ (item A8m). This was re-recorded as ﬁOnline registrationﬂ (item A8c).

North Dakota:

New Jersey: this state reported: ﬁ07/2015 system started recording duplicate transactions.ﬂ

ABSENTEE VOTING ACT (UOCAVA)
SURVEY FINDINGS
  107IntroductionThe Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, or UOCAVA, was enacted to improve 
the voting process for the more than 1.3 million members of the uniformed services stationed 

away from home; their 700,000 eligible family members; and the 5.7 million U.S. citizens 
living, studying, and working overseas.1 The voting process for overseas civilians and military 
members stationed away from their voting residence is different from the regular absentee 
voting process. Voters covered under UOCAVA face unique voting obstacles due to their 
mobility and the time required to transmit and return ballots. 
The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) partners with the Federal Voting Assistance 
Program (FVAP) to collect and evaluate data on the voting experiences of citizens covered 

under UOCAVA, and some of that data is presented in this report. Before 2014, the EAC asked 

states about UOCAVA voting as a part of the Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS), 

and FVAP asked local jurisdictions about UOCAVA voting as a part of its biennial Post-Election 

Survey of Local Election Of˜cials. In 2014, FVAP and the EAC entered into a memorandum 
of understanding under which FVAP and the EAC combined their survey efforts. FVAP added 
certain questions to the EAVS, and the EAC agreed to provide FVAP with all data associated 

with UOCAVA voting after the EAVS had been administered. This collaboration reduced the data 

collection burden on local election of˜cials while still allowing both the EAC and FVAP to ful˜ll 

their congressionally mandated requirements to study UOCAVA voters.
Figure 1 provides an overview of the UOCAVA voting process, which can be divided into six 
basic steps: (1) a voter registers to vote and requests a ballot; (2) the election of˜ce receives 
the request and accepts or rejects it; (3) a ballot is transmitted from the election of˜ce to the 
voter; (3) the ballot is marked by the voter and returned to the election of˜ce; (5) the election 

of˜ce receives the ballot; and (6) the ballot is accepted and counted, or it is rejected.
  108 Figure 1: The UOCAVA Voting Process
Uniformed Service and Overseas Citizen Voting
The UOCAVA section of the EAVS captures information regarding UOCAVA registrations, ballots 
that are transmitted from and received by state and local election of˜ces, and the outcomes 
for the transmitted and received ballots. This includes:
registration and ballot requests by UOCAVA voters;
ballots transmitted to voters by election of˜ces;ballots returned by voters to election of˜ces; 
ballots accepted and counted, and ballots rejected; and
Federal Write-In Absentee Ballots (FWAB) returned by UOCAVA voters.
 109Many of the questions in the UOCAVA section of the EAVS ask for totals at each step in the 
UOCAVA
 voting process to be divided into categories based on the type of voterŠmembers 

of the uniformed services or overseas citizens. Other questions ask for data to be reported 
based on whether the ballot is a transmitted ballotŠa ballot sent from the election of˜ce to 
the voterŠor a FWAB.
2 Additionally, the survey collects information on speci˜c forms used by 
UOCAVA voters, including the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA), which is a registration and 

ballot request form for UOCAVA voters.
The uniformed services
 are the Armed ForcesŠAir Force, Army, 
Marine Corps, and NavyŠthe commissioned corps of the Public Health 
Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 

and the U.S. Merchant Marine. 
Uniformed service members
, their 
spouses, and their dependents are referred to together as uniformed 

services voters. 
Overseas citizens
 are U.S. citizens living outside 

of the United States who are not uniformed service voters but are 

protected by UOCAVA. 
Changes to the UOCAVA Section for the 2016 Survey 
In 2014, the UOCAVA section of the EAVS was expanded to include questions from FVAP™s 
Post-Election Quantitative Survey of Local Election Of˜cials. The goal of combining the surveys 

was to reduce the survey burden on election of˜cials by asking them to answer a single set of 
questions about UOCAVA voting. Although the questions from the two surveys were phrased 
differently and asked for different levels of speci˜city, they captured many of the same data 

points. For example, both surveys asked questions pertaining to ballots transmitted, ballots 

returned, and ballots rejected. After combining the surveys, the new EAVS UOCAVA section 

contained questions that were redundant and, in places, the question language was not clear 

and concise. In order to streamline and improve the 2016 EAVS UOCAVA section, FVAP worked 
with the Council of State Governments™ Overseas Voting Initiative to create a working group 
consisting of state and local election of˜cials. This group identi˜ed the redundant questions in 

the UOCAVA section and the wording issues associated with several questions. 
No changes were made to the survey instrument itself between 2014 and 2016, but additions 
and edits were made to the Supplemental Instruction Manual (SIM) to re˚ect the suggestions 

of the Section B Working Group. Nine questions were identi˜ed as being redundant, and four 
questions contained subitems that asked for data that most states do not record.
3  The SIM instructed states to skip these 13 questions and their 62 subitems, and the items were 
grayed out in the data templates. Table 1 in Appendix B lists the questions that were to be 
skipped and explains what items in the survey replace the skipped items.
 110Improvements to the language that was used in the SIM were also made according to 
recommendations from the working group. The improvements addressed four issues: 
De˜ning UOCAVA status more clearly
: The 2014 survey referred to uniformed services 

voters and overseas citizens without providing a detailed explanation of the meaning 
of each term. This issue was addressed by including the FPCA™s language for the 
de˜nition of UOCAVA
 voters.Clarifying what ﬁtransmitﬂ means when discussing ﬁtransmitted ballotsﬂ: The survey 
refers to transmitted ballots as a way of differentiating between ballots that are sent 
to UOCAVA voters by state or local election of˜ces and FWABs that are not transmitted 

by election of˜ces. The SIM was updated to differentiate between where the ballot 

originates. A transmitted ballot originates in an election of˜ce and is sent via postal 
mail, email, fax, or other mode, and a FWAB originates with the UOCAVA voter. 
Clarifying the meaning of ﬁreturned and submitted for countingﬂ
: The phrase ﬁreturned 
and submitted for countingﬂ suggests that a ballot has to meet two criteria to be 
included in this category. First, the ballot has to be returned by the voter, and second, 

the ballot has to meet the criteria for being counted. Many states and localities 

excluded ballots that were received from voters but had obvious problems, such as 
not being signed by the voter, in this total. Because the EAC and FVAP want the total 
number of ballots returned, regardless of whether the ballot was subsequently counted 

or rejected, the SIM was updated to clarify that questions with this phrasing should 

include all ballots returned by voters, regardless of whether the ballot was counted or 

rejected.
Improving the usability of the SIM
: Previously, the SIM did not provide de˜nitions for all 
items in the survey. Additionally, the information was not presented in an easy-to-use 
format. In the revised SIM, de˜nitions of election terms were added to each item, and 
the SIM was reformatted for greater clarity using plain language principles. 
UOCAVA
 Ballots Transmitted 
Election of˜ces in each jurisdiction are responsible for transmitting blank ballots, either 

through the mail or electronically, to all registered UOCAVA voters who request them. State 

election policies can affect the difference between the number of registered UOCAVA voters 
and the number of ballots transmitted to voters. For example, in some states where UOCAVA 
voters are permanently registered, UOCAVA voters can be designated as ﬁinactiveﬂ.  
  111In 2016, the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories reported 
transmitting 930,156 ballots. The UOCAVA population is distributed unevenly across the 

states. Together, California, Florida, Washington, Texas, New York, and Colorado accounted for 
almost half of all UOCAVA ballots transmitted to voters.  
States and Transmitted UOCAVA Ballots
States with high numbers of UOCAVA ballots transmitted:
 California transmitted 119,740 UOCAVA ballots to voters.
 Florida transmitted 116,674 UOCAVA ballots to voters.
 Washington transmitted 100,994 UOCAVA ballots to voters.
The 2016 EAVS found that nearly all states were able to provide data concerning the UOCAVA 
ballots transmitted by the type of voter. In 2016, 51.4 percent of UOCAVA ballots transmitted 

nationally were sent to U.S. civilians living overseas, 39.6 percent were sent to members 
of the uniformed services and their families, 9 percent of transmitted ballots were not 
differentiated by the type of voter. The proportion of ballots sent to overseas civilians or 

uniformed services members varied by state. In Virginia, for example, UOCAVA ballots were 

split about evenly between uniformed services and overseas civilian voters; in Massachusetts, 

91.6 percent of UOCAVA ballots were transmitted to overseas civilians. In three-˜fths of all 

states, a larger number of ballots were transmitted to uniformed services members.  
A similar number of ballots were transmitted to UOCAVA
 voters in 2012 and 2016. However, 
as seen in Figure 2, the percentage of ballots transmitted to overseas citizens and uniformed 
services voters changed substantially between 2012 and 2016. The number of ballots sent 

to members of the uniformed services decreased by 18.6 percent nationally from 2012 to 

2016. By contrast, there was a 23 percent increase in the number of ballots sent to overseas 

citizens from 2012 to 2016.  
 112Figure 2. Number of Ballots Transmitted to UOCAVA Voters, 2012 and 2016
The change in the distribution of transmitted ballots across voter types was driven by several 
factors. First, 39 states reported transmitting fewer ballots to uniformed services members in 
2016 than in 2012. California alone reported transmitting 35,960 fewer ballots to uniformed 

services members in 2016 than were reported in 2012. However, this is likely due, at least in 
part, to the large number of jurisdictions in California that did not categorize their transmitted 
ballots by voter type; 43 of California™s 58 jurisdictions did not report transmitted ballots 

according to voter type in 2016 compared to only one jurisdiction that did not provide this 

information in 2012. In addition to the changes in the reported numbers of ballots transmitted 

to uniformed services members, 46 states reported transmitting a larger number of ballots to 

overseas civilians in 2016 than in 2012. Illinois, New Jersey, and Massachusetts accounted 
for almost 50 percent of the increase in ballots transmitted to overseas civilians.

22,297 35,230+58.0% 113Transmitted Ballot Statuses
The EAVS tracks a variety of outcomes of ballots that are transmitted to UOCAVA voters. Of all 
the ballots transmitted in 2016, 70.5 percent were returned by voters. Another 19.4 percent 

of ballots were reported to have an unknown status, which may include ballots not received or 
returned. Other ballot dispositions included spoiled or replaced ballots (3.1 percent), ballots 
returned as undeliverable (0.8 percent), other dispositions (0.8 percent), and those unable to 

be categorized by their disposition (5.5 percent). Most states provided the number of ballots 

submitted for counting, but fewer states were able to provide counts of ballots returned as 

undeliverable and spoiled or replaced ballots.
UOCAVA
 Ballots Returned
Once a ballot is marked by the voter, it must be returned to the election of˜ce in the voter™s 

jurisdiction before their state™s deadline for receiving UOCAVA
 ballots. This can be a challenge 
for some voters, depending on when they receive their ballot, how they are able to return their 
ballot, and the location from where they are casting their ballot. For example, voters living in 
another country who must return their ballots by mail may have more dif˜culty submitting a 

ballot before their state™s deadline compared to a voter who can return their ballot by email, 

especially if they do not receive their ballots until shortly before Election Day. To resolve 

the issues presented by mailing times, a few states have adopted online ballot submission 

systems. However, due to security and privacy concerns associated with voted ballots, online 
ballot submission from voters is much less common than online transmission of ballots to 
voters. All UOCAVA voters have the option to use the FWAB in case their regular absentee 

ballot does not arrive in time to vote.
The Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB)
The FWAB
 is a special type of UOCAVA ballot that may be used by 
UOCAVA voters in the event that the voter™s regular UOCAVA ballot does 
not arrive in time to vote. In order to use a FWAB, a voter must have 

registered and requested a ballot.
A total of 633,613 ballots were returned by UOCAVA voters during the 2016 general election.
4 Consistent with previous election cycles, a large majority of the ballots submitted by UOCAVA 
voters during the 2016 general election were transmitted ballots rather than FWABs. States 
reported that 96.3 percent of the ballots submitted in 2016 were regular UOCAVA absentee 
ballots issued by the voters™ jurisdiction. Figure 3 compares the number of ballots transmitted 

by each state to the number of ballots returned by voters. Although California transmitted the 

largest number of ballots to UOCAVA voters, Florida had the largest number of ballots returned. 
 114Figure 3. UOCAVA
 Ballots Transmitted and Returned, 2016
5 115Of the 368,516 ballots transmitted by election of˜ces to uniformed services members, 65.8 
percent were returned. Overseas civilians returned transmitted ballots at a higher rate of 73.7 

percent. Overall, 18 states reported more uniformed services ballots submitted than overseas 
civilian ballots, whereas 29 states had more overseas civilian ballots than uniformed services 
ballots submitted. The remaining seven states did not provide data categorizing the ballots by 

voter type.Federal Write-In Absentee Ballots (FWABs) Received
6 Section 103 of UOCAVA provides a mechanism for uniformed services and overseas civilian 

voters to cast a FWAB (see 52 U.S.C.§ 20303). These ballots are available to uniformed 

aervices voters and voters living outside the United States who requested but did not receive 
the regular absentee ballots after having submitted a timely application for the ballot. The 
FWAB allows all UOCAVA voters to cast a ballot for Federal of˜ces (President/Vice President as 

applicable, U.S. Senator, U.S. Representative, Delegate or Resident Commissioner), and some 

states allow these ballots to be used for elections other than Federal elections.

If a regular absentee ballot does not arrive in time for the individual to vote, the FWAB 

functions as a back-up ballot. The FWAB is available through voting assistance of˜cers at 
military installations, at U.S. embassies or consulates, and on the FVAP website. An absentee 
uniformed services voter typically must:
be absent from his or her voting residence;
have applied for a regular ballot early enough so that the request is received by the 
appropriate local election of˜cer not later than the state deadline or the date that is 30 
days before the general election, unless the state grants additional permission; and
not have received the requested regular absentee ballot from the state, unless the state 
grants additional permission.
A citizen outside the United States typically must:be located outside the United States (including those located at APO/FPO addresses);
have applied for a regular ballot early enough so that the request is received by the 
appropriate local election of˜cer not later than the state deadline or the date that is 30 

days before the general election, 
unless the state grants additional permission
; andnot have received the requested regular absentee ballot from the state, 
unless the state grants additional permission
 (52 U.S.C. § 20301).States reported that 23,391 FWABs were submitted in 2016, which accounted for 3.7 percent 

of all UOCAVA ballots submitted. This small proportion makes sense in the context of the 

FWAB™s purpose, serving as a back-up ballot when the regular requested absentee ballot does 

not arrive in time to vote. However, three statesŠIowa and North CarolinaŠand the District 

of Columbia reported that more than 20 percent of the UOCAVA ballots they received were 
FWABs.
 116The number of FWABs received in the 2016 general election was much lower than in the 
2012 general election, when 44,766 FWABs, representing 7.4 percent of the total number of 

UOCAVA ballots, were submitted (see Figure 4). This could be due, in part, to improvements 
in UOCAVA ballot transmission processes used by election of˜ces. FWAB usage remains a 
relatively small proportion of UOCAVA voting among both uniformed services and overseas 

civilian voters. In 2016, FWABs accounted for 3.3 percent of the total ballots returned by 

uniformed services voters and 3.6 percent returned by overseas civilian voters.
Figure 4. Number of FWABs Received, 2008Œ2016
Ballot Return Rates
7Return rates for UOCAVA ballots are calculated in a unique way, relating to the differences 
between regular UOCAVA ballots and FWABs. As previously discussed, regular UOCAVA ballots 

originate with an election of˜ce and must be transmitted to the voter. FWABs, however, do not 
originate with an election of˜ce, so they cannot be tracked in this manner. Voters can get a 
FWAB, either from the internet or from voting assistance personnel, in the event that they do 

not receive their requested UOCAVA ballot. Under the assumption that voters who submitted 

a FWAB also requested that a regular UOCAVA ballot be transmitted to them, we include 

the counts of FWABs in both the transmitted and returned portions of the ballot return rate 

calculation. 117The rate of return of UOCAVA ballots in 2016 was slightly lower than in the Presidential election 
in 2012. In 2016, 68.1 percent of UOCAVA ballots were returned compared to 69 percent 

in 2012.8 There are many reasons other than non-voting that can explain why a ballot that 
was transmitted to a voter might not be received by the election of˜ce. For example, a blank 

UOCAVA ballot that is sent in the mail by an election of˜ce might not get to a voter due to an 
error in the format of the address on ˜le or dif˜culties with the postal system in the voter™s 
country of residence. Likewise, when the voter returns his or her ballot, it can also fail to reach 

the election of˜ce because the voter might have failed to apply correct postage or might have 

used the wrong address for the election of˜ce.

 Ballots Counted and Rejected
Once a UOCAVA ballot is received by an election of˜ce, election of˜cials determine whether 

it should be accepted and counted, or rejected. The rejection rates of UOCAVA ballots are of 

particular interest because of the variation across states related to ballot return methods, 
deadlines for ballot return, and other factors.
Of the 633,592 regular ballots and FWABs that were received from voters in 2016, 512,696, 
or 80.9 percent, were counted by the states.
9 In 2012, the reported number of regular ballots 
and FWABs that were counted was 478,889. The proportions of ballots counted in 2016 

differed for uniformed services members and overseas civilians: 88.6 percent of the ballots 
returned by uniformed services members were counted, whereas only 78.7 percent of ballots 
from overseas civilians were counted. The number of UOCAVA ballots counted in each state 

in 2016 range from 44 in Rhode Island to 78,361 in Florida.
10 Figure 5 displays the number 
of ballots counted as a percentage of the ballots transmitted to 
UOCAVA
 voters. Many states 
with smaller UOCAVA populations tended to count higher proportions of the ballots they sent 
out to voters. Several states, such as New York and Massachusetts, were unique in that they 
transmitted a large number of UOCAVA ballots and counted a large proportion of those ballots.
 118Figure 5. Percentage of Ballots Transmitted to UOCAVA Voters That Were Counted, 2016
Overall in 2016, the rejection rate for UOCAVA ballots and FWABs was relatively low at the 
national level. In total, 19,039 regular UOCAVA
 ballots and FWABs were rejected, for a national 
rejection rate of 3 percent. Rejection rates ranged from zero percent in seven states to 13.7 

percent in Idaho.
11 Ballots were rejected at approximately equal rates for uniformed services 
members (3 percent) and overseas civilians (2.9 percent). Additionally, the rejection rate is 

slightly in˚ated due to a number of FWABs that were rejected because a regular absentee 
ballot was received from the same voter. These ﬁrejectionsﬂ still resulted in a vote being 
counted, so after correcting for those FWABs, the national rejection rate was 2.8 percent.
The reasons UOCAVA ballots were rejected are of particular interest. The most common reason 
for rejection was that the ballot was not received on time: 44.4 percent of the rejected ballots 

in 2016 were not counted for this reason. Another 16.2 percent were rejected because of 

problems with a required voter signature; for example, the signature may not have matched 
the signature on ˜le or it may have been missing altogether. An additional 3.2 percent were 
rejected because the ballot lacked a postmark. Figure 6 displays the reasons that ballots were 

rejected in 2012 and 2016. More ballots were rejected due to missed deadlines and voter 

signature issues in 2012 than in 2016; in 2016, more ballots were rejected because they 

lacked a postmark. 119Figure 6. Reasons for Rejecting UOCAVA Ballots, 2016
Transmitted Ballots Counted
A total of 495,649 transmitted ballots were counted in the 2016 general election. About 43.6 
percent of these ballots were submitted by uniformed service members, and 56.1 percent 

were submitted by overseas civilians. The remaining ballots were from other voter types or 
were not classi˜ed. 
FWABs Counted
Use of the FWAB resulted in at least 17,047 ballots being counted in the 2016 general 
election.12 FWABs made up 3.3 percent of UOCAVA ballots counted in the 2016 election.
13 Of the number of FWABs counted, 33.3 percent were from uniformed services members and 58.8 

percent were from overseas civilians. The largest numbers of FWABs were counted in California 
(3,059), North Carolina (1,628), and Pennsylvania (1,485).
Transmitted Ballots Rejected 
In the 2016 election, the states reported rejecting 14,964 UOCAVA ballots that had originated 

with the elections of˜ce. Ballots received back from uniformed services members and 
overseas civilians were rejected at a roughly equal rate (about 2.5 percent). Several states 

rejected UOCAVA ballots at much higher rates than other states, as measured by the ratio of 
rejected to counted UOCAVA ballots. Missouri, Puerto Rico, and South Carolina counted all of 
their submitted ballots and rejected zero. Idaho, on the other hand, counted 2,352 transmitted 

ballots (88.3 percent) and rejected 311 (11.7 percent). 
 120FWABs Rejected
Of the 23,391 FWABs submitted in 2016, 4,075 (17.4 percent) were rejected.
14 FWAB 
rejection rates ranged from zero percent in seven states to 59.8 percent in Idaho and 68.5 
percent in Indiana. Unlike transmitted ballots, the rejection rate for FWABs was higher for 
uniformed services members than overseas civilians. FWABs received from uniformed service 
members were rejected at a rate of 20.0 percent, whereas FWABs from overseas civilians were 

rejected at a rate of 14.3 percent.
Figure 7. Reasons for Rejecting FWABs, 2016
The EAVS collects data on two reasons that FWABs can be rejected. Of all the FWABs that 
were rejected in the 2016 general election, 1,184 were rejected because they were received 
after the ballot receipt deadline. An additional 1,139 were rejected because the voters™ regular 

absentee ballot was received. Figure 7 displays the reasons FWABs were rejected in 2016. 
Roughly equal proportions of ballots were rejected due to a missed deadline or because a 
regular UOCAVA ballot was received from the voter. However, for nearly half of the rejected 

FWABs (43 percent), the reason for rejection was not speci˜ed. This could indicate one of 

two things: either states do not track the reasons that FWABs were rejected or FWABs were 

rejected for some other reason not listed.
 121Comparison: Transmitted Ballots versus FWABs
FWABs were used at similar rates by uniformed service members and overseas civilians in the 
2016 general election. Of the 250,683 ballots received from uniformed services members, 

3.1 percent were FWABs, and of the 365,854 ballots received from overseas civilians, 3.6 
percent were FWABs.

Members242,4688,215Overseas Civilians352,65713,197Notably, and consistent with past survey data, FWABs were more likely to be rejected than 
regular state absentee ballots. FWABs made up 21.4 percent of the 19,039 rejected UOCAVA 

ballots, although FWABs were only 3.7 percent of the ballots returned by voters. States 
reported receiving 23,391 FWABs and rejecting 4,075, or 17.4 percent. For transmitted 
ballots, the rejection rate was much smaller at 2.5 percent. Almost half of all rejected FWABs 

were in three statesŠTexas, Maryland, and California.

2  The FWAB is a back-up ballot that can be used by UOCAVA voters to cast a vote, if their requested absentee 
ballot does not arrive in time.
3  The subitems that were removed related to ballots transmitted to voters 45 days before the election and 
then ballots transmitted closer to the election.4  The report will only use counts of transmitted ﬁregularﬂ UOCAVA ballots and FWABs that were returned. 
Although the EAVS generally collects data on all types of UOCAVA ballots, even those that cannot be classi˜ed 
by type, the questions in the 2016 EAVS concerning the number of ballots returned only collected information 

on the two main ballot types of interestŠregular UOCAVA ballots and FWABs. These changes in data 

collection and reporting from previous years are due to the questions that were marked for skipping in the 

2016 SIM, discussed on pages 119Œ120 and Appendix B of this report.
5  In this ˜gure, four states are not included because they did not report B26aŒe, which asked about 
the number of ballots transmitted to UOCAVA voters that were returned. Those states are Connecticut, 

Mississippi, New Jersey, and Oregon. Data on the number of ballots transmitted by those states can be found 

in UOCAVA Table 1.
6  When discussing the rest of the voting process, special attention will be given to discussing transmitted 
ballots and FWABs separately. Transmitted ballots are sent from the elections of˜ce to the voter, but FWABs 

originate with the voter. A FWAB can be supplied by a voting assistance of˜cer, found at consulates and 

the of˜ces of overseas voting groups, or downloaded from the internet. Due to these differences in ballot 

origination, there are several different ways to calculate ballot return rates. Additionally, transmitted ballots 

and FWABs look different and have different requirements for being counted, so their rejection rates and 

reasons for rejection may also differ.
7  Calculations of UOCAVA ballot return rates in this report intend to include two types of ballots: regular 
UOCAVA ballots and FWABs. Due to changes in how states were asked to complete the survey in 2016, the 

survey did not collect information on the numbers of ballots returned that were an ﬁotherﬂ ballot type or could 

not be categorized by ballot type.8  The return rate for a given state may be slightly higher or lower than average because of the way cases in 
which a voter returned multiple ballots were handled. For example, if a voter returned both a FWAB and a 

transmitted ballot, typically the transmitted ballot is counted. However, if a state counted both as returned, it 

could in˚ate the rate of returned ballots.
9  When discussing these counts of ballots, we focus solely on transmitted ballots and FWABs because we 
do not have counts of ﬁotherﬂ or ﬁuncategorizedﬂ types of ballots that were returned. Due to the skipped 

questions in the 2016 survey, we do not have data on how many of these other ballots were returned. If we 

had included all returned UOCAVA ballots in our calculations of count rates and return rates, the rates would 

be arti˜cially in˚ated.
10  The numbers of ballots counted that were reported here only include regular UOCAVA ballots (B10aŒc) and 
FWABs counted (B11aŒc). States and territories that did not categorize their counted ballots (B9aŒc) into 

these subitems are not included.
11  The U. S. Virgin Islands were not able to report the number of ballots rejected, so they are not included in 
this analysis. Three states were not able to report a breakdown of the number of ballots rejected.
12  The actual number of FWABs that were counted may be higher as some states were not able to provide a 
breakdown of their UOCAVA ballots by type of ballot.
 12313  This is the percentage of FWABs that were counted out of the total number of regular UOCAVA ballots and 
FWABs that were counted.
14  The numbers of FWABs that were counted and rejected do not add up to the number of FWABs that 
were returned. The disposition of the remaining 2,270 FWABs is unknown due to non-response from some 
jurisdictions and the use of different questions to make these calculations. There was no check within the 

data template to ensure that states reported a number of counted and rejected FWABs that was equal to the 

number returned. Additionally, some states differ in how they de˜ne rejected ballots. For example, in a few 

states, ballots that are returned after the submission deadline are neither counted nor rejectedŠthey are 

simply considered returned ballots.
 124UOCAVA Appendix A: 
 Additional Information 
Laws Affecting UOCAVA Voters
The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA)
 requires states 
and territories to provide a means for these citizens to register and to vote in elections 

for Federal of˜ce using absentee procedures. Under UOCAVA, citizens can use the Federal 

Post Card Application (FPCA) to register to vote and to request their absentee ballot. 

UOCAVA
 also provides for the use of a Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB), which 

can be cast under certain conditions by voters who have applied for but who have not yet 

received their absentee ballot. 
The Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment (MOVE) Act
 amended UOCAVA in October 
2009. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that military personnel and overseas 

citizens have suf˜cient time to request and receive ballots and that states allow enough 

time for the submitted ballots to be counted toward the election results. Provisions of the 

act include requirements for states to transmit ballots at least 45 days before Federal 

elections and to offer electronic transmission of voting information and blank ballots. 

The MOVE Act also eliminated the Federal requirement that ballots be automatically 

transmitted for two subsequent general election cycles. This requirement changed to a 

minimum of the calendar year in which the FPCA was submitted.The Help America Vote Act (HAVA )
 was passed in 2002, and section 703(a) HAVA 
amended section 102 of UOCAVA by adding the requirement that each state must report 

certain election data to the EAC no more than 90 days after each Federal election. 

The data is to include the number of absentee ballots transmitted to absent uniformed 

services voters and overseas voters for the election and the number of those ballots that 

were returned. HAVA also provided that the EAC work with its board of advisors and its 

standards board to create a standardized format for collecting the data and that the data 

be made available to the public.  125Data Collection Requirements
The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), 42 U.S.C. § 15301 
et seq., mandates that, for each regularly scheduled general election for Federal of˜ce, the EAC shall collect 

comprehensive data from the states on all of the ballots sent and received by voters 

covered by UOCAVA, 42 U.S.C. § 1973ff. The UOCAVA statute also requires FVAP to collect 

data on UOCAVA voting.  
Beginning in 2014, the EAC and FVAP consolidated their data collection efforts related to 
UOCAVA voters, using Section B of the EAVS as the sole method of collecting these data. 

The 2016 EAVS used a new and improved UOCAVA section that aimed to ease survey 

completion for the states while also improving the quality of the data being collected. 

Stakeholders and subject matter experts worked together to combine repetitive items 

and make the survey language more easy to interpret. These updates were provided in an 

instruction manual that was distributed along with the survey instrument. This report on 

UOCAVA voting will contain more information than past years on the use of special forms 

such as the FPCA and the FWAB.

Alabama: Some jurisdictions reported ballots transmitted to Military spouses in B1d. For this report, they were added 

to the Uniformed Services members category, B1b.
California:
 The state reported a much lower number of ballots transmitted to Uniformed Services members in 2016 
than in 2012 due to many of its jurisdictions not categorizing transmitted ballots by voter type in 2016.Florida: One jurisdiction reported ballots transmitted to Military spouses in B1d. For this report, they were added to 
the Uniformed Services members category, B1b.
Hawaii: One jurisdiction reported ballots transmitted to Military dependents in B1d. For this report, they were 
added to the Uniformed Services members category, B1b. Additionally, the jurisdiction with the largest number 

of transmitted ballots in Hawaii did not categorize those ballots by voter type, so the reported number of ballots 

transmitted to Uniformed Services Members in 2016 is much lower than in 2012.
Iowa: The state did not categorize its transmitted ballots by voter type. 
Rhode Island: The state did not categorize its transmitted ballots by voter type.

 154UOCAVA Table 7 Data Notes
General note: Some percentages and rates in this table are greater than 100% due to difference in how states 
reported transmitted and received ballots. 
Alabama: Some jurisdictions reported ballots transmitted to Military spouses in B1d. For this report, they were 
added to the Uniformed Services Members category, B1b. Some jurisdictions reported ballots received from Military 

spouses in B26d. For this report, they were added to the Uniformed Services Members category, B26b. 
California:
 The state reported a much lower number of ballots transmitted to Uniformed Services members in 2016 
than in 2012 due to many of its jurisdictions not categorizing transmitted ballots by voter type in 2016.Connecticut: The state did not report receiving any 
UOCAVA
 ballots.
Florida: One jurisdiction reported ballots transmitted to Military spouses in B1d. For this report, they were added to 
the Uniformed Services members category, B1b.One jurisdiction did not report the number of ballots counted from 

Uniformed Services Members, B9a. This number was back-˜lled with the sum of its parts (B10a, B11a and B12a).
Hawaii: One jurisdiction reported ballots transmitted to Military dependents in B1d. For this report, they were 
added to the Uniformed Services members category, B1b. Additionally, the jurisdiction with the largest number 

of transmitted ballots in Hawaii did not categorize those ballots by voter type, so the reported number of ballots 

transmitted to Uniformed Services Members in 2016 is much lower than in 2012.
Iowa: The state did not categorize its transmitted ballots by voter type. 
Kansas: Some jurisdictions did not report the number of ballots counted from Uniformed Services Members, B9a. For 
this report, the number was back-˜lled with the sum of its parts (B10a, B11a and B12a). Some jurisdictions did not 

report the number of ballots rejected from Uniformed Services members, B15a, so those numbers were back-˜lled 

with the sum of its parts (B16a, B17a and B18a).
Mississippi: The state did not report receiving any 
UOCAVA
 ballots.
New Jersey: The state did not report receiving any 
UOCAVA
 ballots.
New Mexico: Some jurisdictions did not report the number of ballots rejected from Uniformed Services members, 
B15a, so those numbers were back-˜lled with the sum of its parts (B16a, B17a and B18a).
Oregon:
 The state did not report receiving any 
UOCAVA
 ballots.
Rhode Island: The state did not provide a breakdown of voter type for transmitted, received, counted or rejected 
ballots.Texas:
 Some jurisdictions reported ballots transmitted to Military spouses in B1d. For this report, they were added to 
the Uniformed Services Members category, B1b. Some jurisdictions reported ballots counted from Military spouses in 

B9c. For this report, they were added to the Uniformed Services Members category, B9a. Some jurisdictions did not 

report B9a, so those numbers were back-˜lled with the sum of their parts (B10a, B11a and B12a). Some jurisdictions 

did not report the number of ballots rejected from Uniformed Services members, B15a, so those numbers were back-

˜lled with the sum of its parts (B16a, B17a and B18a). Additionally, one jurisdiction reported ballots received from 

Military spouses in B26d. For this report, they were added to the Uniformed Services Members category, B26b
Virginia:
 Ballots counted from Military spouses were reported in B9c. For this report, they were added to the 
Uniformed Services Members category, B9a. Ballots rejected from Military spouses were reported in B15c. For this 

report, they were added to the Uniformed Services members category, B15a. FWABs received from Military spouses 

and their dependents were reported in B31c. For this report, they were added to the Uniformed Services Members 

category, B31a.
Wisconsin:
 Some jurisdictions did not report the number of ballots rejected from Uniformed Services members, 
B15a, so those numbers were back-˜lled with the sum of its parts (B16a, B17a and B18a).

  159Survey Methodology
Since 2004, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) has conducted the Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS). The EAVS asks all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 

and four U.S. territoriesŠAmerican Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin IslandsŠ
questions about voter registration, absentee voting, voting by individuals covered by the
 Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), provisional voting, election 
technology, poll workers and polling places, and total turnout.
1 The EAVS satis˜es the EAC™s 
requirements under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) to serve as a clearinghouse for election 

data. The sections of the EAVS related to voter registration and UOCAVA voting allows states 
to satisfy their data reporting requirements established, respectively, by the National Voter 
Registration Act (NVRA) and UOCAVA.
The EAVS data reported here re˚ect the data submitted and certi˜ed by 50 states, the District 
of Columbia, and three U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands).
2 Data for each state was collected at the jurisdiction level, with 6,437 of the 6,467 jurisdictions 

nationwide (99 percent) included in data for the 2016 EAVS. Only four states had a jurisdiction-
level response rate under 100 percent: Hawaii, Illinois, and MaineŠeach had one non-
reporting jurisdictionŠand Texas was missing data for 27 of its 254 jurisdictions. Appendix A 

shows the number of jurisdictions and the response rate by state (overall and for each section 

of the EAVS).
Survey Questionnaire
The 2016 EAVS questionnaire was the same one used in 2014, except that several questions 

in the 2016 survey could be skipped. The EAVS is divided into six sections, each of which 

collects data on a different aspect of voting and election administration: 
Section A is the voter registration section. Questions about the total number of registered 
voters, the number of new voter registrations, and the sources of voter registrations were 
included in this section. Section B focuses on voting activities related to UOCAVA. 
Section C focuses on domestic civilian absentee ballots. Section D collects data on election administration, such as the numbers of precincts, 

polling places, and election workers. Section E asks for information on provisional ballots. 
Section F covers Election Day activities, including voter turnout, use of electronic poll 

books, and types of voting equipment.Though the survey instrument was unchanged in 2016, additions and edits were made to the 

Supplemental Instruction Manual (SIM) so that it was easier to use and contained complete 
 160de˜nitions for all key terms in the survey. The 2016 EAVS consisted of 438 ˜elds that required 
an answer, but 171 of those ˜elds were ﬁotherﬂ categories or comment boxes that were 

optional to the respondents.
Revisions to Section B
In 2014, the UOCAVA
 section of the EAVS was expanded to include questions from the 
Federal Voting Assistance Program™s (FVAP) Post-Election Quantitative Survey of Local Election 
Of˜cials. The goal of combining the surveys was to reduce the survey burden on election 

of˜cials by asking them to answer a single set of questions about UOCAVA voting. Although 

the questions from the two surveys were phrased differently and asked for different levels 

of speci˜city, they captured many of the same data points. For example, both surveys asked 
questions pertaining to ballots transmitted, ballots returned, and ballots rejected. In order to 
streamline and improve the UOCAVA section in the 2016 EAVS, no response was required for 

several redundant questions and subitems requesting data that most states do not record.
3  In the SIM, states were instructed to skip 13 questions with 62 subitems. These items were also 

grayed out in the data templates. Appendix B lists the questions that were to be skipped and 
explains what items in the survey replaced the skipped items. A more detailed explanation of 
the process for streamlining Section B is available in the 2016 EAVS UOCAVA Report.
The Data Collection Templates
The EAVS data were collected from statesŠor jurisdictions within statesŠusing two versions 

of an Excel data template. The data templates were state speci˜c; each state received a 

version that contained the name and FIPS code for each of its local jurisdictions. Until this year, the EAVS data were collected using an Excel workbook called the Data Entry Template. 
The Data Entry Template could be viewed either as a worksheet or in a form view, which walked 

respondents through each survey question.  
For the 2016 implementation of the EAVS, a new template, the Data Aggregation Template, 
was developed. The Data Aggregation Template served several purposes. The template made 

it easier for states with centralized, top-down election management systems to complete the 

EAVS at the state level without having to enter data for each jurisdiction individually. For states 
that sent out the Data Entry Template to their local jurisdictions, the aggregation template 
could be used to compile responses from each jurisdiction. To facilitate state aggregation 

of data, the Data Entry Template was updated to include a feature that exported data for all 

sections of the EAVS onto a single sheet. Data could then be pasted into the Data Aggregation 

Template to compile a single state submission. An instruction manual and training videos were 
provided to help with the use of the data templates.
Data Validation
One of the key issues associated with any data collection project is ensuring that the data 
collected are accurate. It is relatively easy to make mistakes, such as copying and pasting 

data into the wrong columns or rows or transposing numbers, when entering data. Both EAVS 
templates included built-in, ﬁinternalﬂ validation checks that ˚agged speci˜c types of errors. In 
 161addition, data analyses were run to check to see if reported data were very different from the 
data reported in similar localities. These validations are discussed in more detail below.
Internal Validations
The EAVS internal validations checked ˚agged data because they appeared to have been 

entered incorrectly, based on other data points entered into the template. For example, 
question C1b in the EAVS asked jurisdictions to report the total number of by-mail absentee 
ballots that were returned by voters. Question C4a asked how many of the returned ballots 

were counted, and question C4b asked how many of these ballots were rejected. The internal 

validations checked that the total number of ballots counted and the total number of ballots 
rejected equaled the total number of ballots returned. In addition, the internal validations were 
designed to catch blank cells where necessary information should have been included.
4  In the Data Entry Template, when a validation check was violated, the corresponding cell was 
highlighted and the violated rule was reported in an error window.
5 In the Data Aggregation 
Template, the error check function reported all internal validation errors in two separate error 

tabs. One tab reported items that were left blank and another tab listed places where there 
were internal validation issues. These error tabs listed the errors by jurisdiction, then by 
question. The validation checks were designed so that if a state™s of˜cials thought it had a 

legitimate reason for violating a validation, they could ignore a validation error and certify that 

the state™s data were complete and accurate to the best of their knowledge. 
External Validations
After each state submitted its data, external validation checks were run to highlight any 

discrepancies between the ﬁexpectedﬂ values for certain items and the data reported by the 
state. These external validation checks were run for the ˜rst time in 2016. These checks 
served as an additional way to ˚ag potential errors in either the data entry or data collection 

procedures. External validations ˚agged jurisdictions if the value reported in the 2016 

EAVS was signi˜cantly higher or lower than might be expected for jurisdictions with similar 

characteristics (e.g., population, urbanization, median household income, other demographic 
characteristics).  Although external validations sometimes incorrectly ˚agged jurisdictions that were outliersŠ
for example, jurisdictions with large military populations were sometimes ˚agged by external 
validations in relation to UOCAVA votingŠthey were particularly effective in identifying cases 

in which data had been entered into the wrong column or other data layout issues affected 

accuracy. Based on the initial use of these validations, the EAC learned how these might be 

improved to better detect true data errors. See Appendix C for a more detailed discussion of 
the external validation methodology. 
Data Processing
States were given the data templates before the 2016 general election, and states could 
submit data at any time, with the ˜nal deadline for initial, complete submissions being 
 162February 1, 2017. Once submitted, both internal and external validations were run on each 
state™s data. In addition, a state™s data submission was examined for completeness. When 

errors, questions about missing data, or other questions emerged, a memo outlining every 
issue was prepared, and the data were referred back to the states for review and correction, 
as appropriate. States had two weeks to review and correct their submissions and certify their 

state™s 2016 EAVS data submission. The ˜nal data certi˜cation deadline was March 1, 2017.
6Data Reporting and Calculations
All calculations included in the EAVS report used the 2016 jurisdiction-level data provided by 

each state. Most of the data were reported at the state or national level. State totals were 

calculated by summing the data from all jurisdictions within a state, and national totals were 
calculated aggregating the state-level totals. Whenever possible, the EAVS Comprehensive 
Report uses percentages and rates for comparative purposes. For these computations, 

items were combined, as necessary, to create the numerator and denominator to produce a 

percentage or rate. For example, the following formula was used to calculate the percentage of 

registered voters who voted in the 2016 Presidential Election: 
[ Item F1a (total voters) / Item A1a (registered voters) ] x 100
When jurisdictions did not report data for a particular question (i.e., left the item blank), that 

cell, as well as any rate derived from that question, was treated as a missing value. When the 

calculation included items for which a limited number of states or jurisdictions responded, 

only the data from those jurisdictions that reported all data were included. This decision rule 
means that there were instances in which the rates that were reported were not available 
for all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories. For this reason, the number of 

jurisdictions that reported data was throughout the EAVS when results are reported (e.g., 47 

out of the 55 states and territories provided information about con˜rmation notices). 
Statutory Overview
The Statutory Overview (SO) survey was distributed to the point of contact (POC) in all 

50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories on August 29, 2016. The 

questionnaire used in 2016 was identical to the one used in 2014. The SO survey was 
transmitted to each POC by email and was available in a password-protected section of a 
website used for the EAVS project. The survey was sent as a ˜llable PDF, with state responses 

to the 2014 survey included in the document. States were then asked to either con˜rm that 

each law or policy that was asked about in the survey had not changed between 2014 and 

2016. States were asked to submit their completed SO surveys by September 30, 2016. All 

jurisdictions except for American Samoa responded to the survey.  
Once all of the responses were received, analysts and subject matter experts reviewed the 
2016 responses by examining the descriptive phrases used for each category. States often 
use different wording to describe the same concept, and analysts looked for the common 
 163denominator in the responses for purposes of coding the response. A data set was created by 
examining the key features of each question captured. 
Data Quality Improvement Through Training and Technical Assistance
In 2016, the EAC continued its efforts to improve the EAVS and SO survey instruments and 

to provide effective technical assistance. In the months preceding the survey administration, 

preparations were made to simplify the process of completing the EAVS and to address 
challenges faced by state and local election of˜cials completing the survey. For example, 
the EAC used feedback gathered from the statesŠespecially the EAVS state POCŠand 

other stakeholders to improve the 2016 EAVS process and provide effective outreach to 

jurisdictions. Changes made to the EAVS included revising the SIM, improving the Excel Data 

Entry Template, and creating a Data Aggregation Template. The EAC also conducted two 

webinars and created a set of videos explaining how to use the data templates and providing a 
detailed, question-by-question description of each section of the survey.  
Revisions to the SIM
Based on feedback received from state POCs and other stakeholders, revisions were made to 
the SIM. The purpose of the SIM is to provide states with additional instructions for completing 

the EAVS and more in-depth explanations of what the questions are asking. In 2016, the 
instructions for each question were updated to address some of the issues and confusion 
expressed by the states.
7 Some of the updates to the SIM clari˜ed the de˜nitions of terms 
used in the survey. For example, the 2016 SIM provides de˜nitions for ﬁactive voterﬂ and 

ﬁinactive voterﬂ that states should use to answer question A2 and subsequent questions in 
the survey. Additionally, more descriptive language was added to the 2016 SIM to make it 
clearer for how to answer certain questions. For example, the descriptions of the different 

types of registrationŠsuch as new valid registrations, new pre-registrations, and invalid or 

rejected registrationsŠthat question A5 refers to were added to the SIM. 
Webinars and ﬁBoot Campﬂ Videos
In addition to revisions in the SIM, new resources were developed to assist states with the 

EAVS process. To help states prepare for the 2016 EAVS, a webinar was conducted on August 

31, 2016. The goal of this webinar was to describe steps that states could take in advance 
to be ready for the data collection phase. On December 5, 2016, a second webinar was 
conducted that highlighted the steps for completing the EAVS and submitting data. During each 

webinar, email and direct messaging capabilities were available for listeners to submit their 

questions and for EAC to answer them live. The webinars were recorded and posted on the 

EAVS portal so that they could be viewed at any time.
Several other videos were created as a part of the EAC™s effort to ease the completion of the 
EAVS. A data ﬁBoot Campﬂ video was created for each section of the EAVS. This video series 
walked through each section of the survey, question by question, explaining the meaning of the 
question and the type of data that should and should not be included in the reported numbers. 
 164A set of EAVS technical boot camp videos were also created. These videos demonstrated how 
to use a few EAVS resources, including the EAVS portal and the EAVS data templates. 
Technical Assistance
Technical assistance was provided throughout the entire EAVS process by the EAVS team. 

Two elections subject matter experts were available at all times to handle more challenging 

questions and assistance requests. During the busiest data collection period from January 
through March 2017, an additional team of nine trained technical assistants was available 
to assist states with data collection and submission. The technical assistance help desk 

answered inquiries via email and phone. In total, the team assisted with more than 400 

technical assistance requests over the data collection period.  
 165Endnotes
1  The Northern Mariana Islands are not included in the EAVS because this territory did not have 
representation in Congress at the time HAVA was enacted.
2  American Samoa did not respond to the EAVS.
3  FVAP worked with the Council of State Government™s Overseas Voting Initiative to create a working group 
consisting of state and local election of˜cials. This group identi˜ed ways to streamline and improve Section B 
of the EAVS by removing redundant and particularly challenging questions. The subitems that were removed 

were related to ballots transmitted to voters 45 days before the election and then ballots transmitted closer 

to the election. However, most states do not track the date that each ballot was transmitted in a way that 

could be used to answer this question.4  In some cases, cells were left blank because the question was not applicable (N/A) or data were not 
available (also N/A).5  See Methodology Appendix A for the complete list of internal validation rules.
6  Data were received from 54 states and territories by the March 1, 2017 deadline.
7  These improvements were made based upon recommendations made by the CSG Section B working group.

 External Data Validations
Introduction
The major limitation of only using other items within a complete survey to identify error in 
a response item is that response items might be perfectly consistent with each other but 

still contain substantial measurement error. For example, the number of absentee ballots 
transmitted might be lower than the total number of registrants; this would not violate a 
validation rule that the transmission number has to be smaller than the registrant number. 

However, if the total number of registrants is twice the size of the civilian voting age population 
(CVAP) then both the absentee ballot transmission number and the registration number could 
be incorrect.  
To account for this, the EAC used external data to form an expectation for what each 
jurisdiction should have reported, based on the jurisdiction™s geography and demographics. 
Responses with the highest probability of having error were those with substantially higher 

or lower than expected values for that item in 2016, based on the average (logged) count 

for the counties with similar characteristics (e.g., similar population, urbanization, fraction of 

foreign born). Each county is unique, so differences between what the local election of˜ce 

(LEO) reports and what we expect does not always represent inaccuracy in what is reported by 
the LEO. Consequently, the external validations only identi˜ed items as potentially mistaken 
if the discrepancy between what the LEO reported and what was expected was quite large. 

Generally speaking, only jurisdictions that reported data at the largest or smallest 2.5 percent 

of respondents were ˚agged as being outside the expected range. 
Technical Approach  
If it is assumed that the probability of an entry in the EAVS being subject to measurement error 

increases with the difference between what one would expect from a jurisdiction and what the 

EAVS indicates the count is, then a simple decision rule for identifying suspect entries can 
take the following form:
Error = Yes if  
| Ln(1+yi ) Œ Ln
(1+yi ) | >2M and No Otherwise
Where  is the relevant count (i.e. number of absentee ballots) for jurisdiction 
i and  is de˜ned as follows:1) M = med (| (Ln(1+yi ) Œ Ln
(1+yi )) Œ med ((Ln(1+yi ) Œ Ln
(1+yi )) |)In other words, an entry for a jurisdiction would be identi˜ed as being subject to measurement 

error due to a miss entry if the absolute difference between (the natural log
1 XXX of ) the entry 
and the expected (logged) entry for that jurisdiction, from now on referred to as the residual, 
exceeded seven times the median absolute deviation from the median residual. The choice of 
 177seven is largely arbitrary and can be smaller or larger based on whether one wants to be more 
conservative or lenient with respect to identifying entries as being subject to measurement 

error.
The expected logged entry 
Ln(yi)2 will vary based on the characteristics of the county. For 
example, one would typically expect larger counties to have higher counts. The expected 
(logged) count can be modeled as follows:2) Ln(1+yi) = XiWhere 
Xi is a vector of determinants of the ﬁtrueﬂ number of ballots being counted, but which 
is assumed to not be systematically related to measurement error. Table 1 lists the variables 

used in these analyses and their sources.

The challenge in estimating  to generate the expected logged counts was that the expected or true counts could not be observed, but rather only what was reported in the EAVS. To the 

degree that there was substantial measurement error in the EAVS, 
^ estimated via ordinary 
least squares (OLS) re˚ected the relationship between 
Xi and the measurement error and not 
 178just the average marginal effect of 
Xi on (1+yi), resulting in a biased estimate for 
Ln(1+yi). To 
mitigate this issue, Equation 2 was estimated using robust regression (rreg 
3in Stata), which iteratively re-estimated equation 2, down weighting observations based on residuals in the 
previous iteration. This procedure mitigated the in˚uence of measurement error on the ˜nal 
model.The deviation from the expected logged count 
(Ln(1+yi) Œ Ln(1+yi)) was calculated, and jurisdictions that had large deviations from the expected response were ˚agged using the 
decision rule above. Because some of the predictors (
Xi) were measured with error, a relatively 
conservative decision rule was applied.
The Auditing Process
For each question in the survey, two items were provided:
1) The ﬁexpectedﬂ (natural log of 1 plus the) response to that item based on the 

characteristics of the jurisdiction and responses to the 2016 EAVS. This differed between 

jurisdictions for a given question.2) M, which captured the variability in the difference between the actual 2016 response and 

the expected 2016 response. This item varied across questions but would not vary by 

jurisdiction for a given question.The following steps were taken for each response in each completed survey:
1) For each greater than zero count, the natural log of 1 plus the count was taken.
2) The absolute difference between the actual 2016 (log transformed) item and the 

expected (log transformed) item was calculated. 
3) The absolute difference was divided by 
M.4) If the ratio from step 3 exceeded that of step 2, this item was ˚agged as having a 

potential error.
 179Endnotes
1  Count variables were typically logged so that 1) the expected y did not take negative values, 2) to minimize 
the effect of outliers on model estimates, and 3) because the differences in the logs of the predicted and 
natural counts could be interpreted as a percentile difference, which is arguably of more interest than the 

absolute difference because it is invariant to jurisdiction size, with the exception of cases where 1) the 

response was zero and 2) the expected count was close to zero. The analysis took 1 + the count in order to 

admit zero observations into the estimates, although this somewhat complicated the interpretation of the 

coef˜cients.2  http://www.stata.com/manuals13/rrreg.pdf

 2016
 Election Administration & Voting Survey
     The ongoing process of improving America™s election systems relies in part on having accurate data about the way 

Americans cast their ballots. In 
2002, Congress chartered the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) 
to collect 
information on the state of American elections and make it widely available to policy makers, advocates, scholars, 

journalists and the general public. Since 
2004, the Commission has sponsored a biennial survey as its primary tool for 
fulfilling that mission.  We are pleased to present the 
2016 Election Administration and Voting Survey, and we ask for 
your help in making it the most complete and accurate survey in its history.  
The questions below ask for information about ballots cast, voter registration, overseas and military voting, 
Election Day 
activities, voting technology, and other important issues.  The section concerning the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens 
Voting Act (
UOCAVA
) serves as the EAC™s standardized format for 
State reporting of UOCAVA voting information as 
required by 
42 U.S.C. §1973ff
-1. States that complete and timely submit this section to the EAC will fulfill their UOCAVA 
reporting requirement under 42 U.S.C. §1973ff-1(c). Additionally, EAC is mandated by the National Voter Registration Act 
(NVRA) to collection information from states concerning the impact of that statute on the administration of Federal 
elections. With this information, EAC is required to make a report to Congress and provide recommendations for the 

improvement of Federal and State procedures, forms, and other NVRA matters. States that timely respond to all 

questions in this survey concerning voter registration related matters will meet their NVRA reporting requirements under 
42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-7 and EAC regulations. 
 
The EAC recognizes the burden t
hat asking for 
these
 data places on 
State and local election officials, and we have 
worked to minimize that burden as much as possible.   
 In advance, we thank you for your cooperation and look forward to answering any questions you might have.
