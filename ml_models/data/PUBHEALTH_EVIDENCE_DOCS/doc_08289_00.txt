    The Odds of Ratio for Improvement on a 7-point Ordinal Scale on Day 14 [ Time Frame: Day 14 ]The odds ratio represents the odds of improvement in the ordinal scale between the treatment groups.
 The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at a given day.
 Each day, the worst score from the previous day will be recorded.
 The scale is as follows: 1.
 Death 2.
 Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) 3.
 Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices 4.
 Hospitalized, requiring low flow supplemental oxygen 5.
 Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (coronavirus (COVID-19) related or otherwise) 6.
 Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer required ongoing medical care (other than per protocol Remdesivir administration 7.
 Not hospitalized.
