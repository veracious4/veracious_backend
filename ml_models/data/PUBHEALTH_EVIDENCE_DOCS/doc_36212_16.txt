2 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019Trends
IntroductionThis report presents detailed 2017 data on deaths and death rates according to a number of demographic and medical characteristics. These data provide information on mortality 

patterns among residents of the United States by such variables 
as age, sex, Hispanic origin and race, state of residence, and 
cause of death. Information on these mortality patterns is key to 
understanding changes in the health and well-being of the U.S. 
population (1). Companion reports present additional details on 

leading causes of death and life expectancy in the United States 

(2,3). Mortality data in this report can be used to monitor and evaluate the health status of the United States in terms of current 
mortality levels and long-term mortality trends, as well as to 
identify segments of the U.S. population at greater risk of death 
from speci˜c diseases and injuries. Differences in death rates 
among various demographic subpopulations, including race and 
ethnicity groups, may re˚ect subpopulation differences in factors 

such as socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and the 

prevalence of speci˜c risk factors in a particular subpopulation.MethodsData in this report are based on information from all resident death certi˜cates ˜led in the 50 states and the District of 
Columbia. More than 99% of deaths occurring in this country are 

believed to be registered (4). Tables showing data by state also 

provide information for Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, 
American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern 

Mariana Islands (Northern Marianas). Cause-of-death statistics 
presented in this report are classi˜ed in accordance with the 

International Classi˜cation of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICDŒ10) (5Œ7). Selected causes are presented primarily based on their 
impact on public health and future planning. A discussion of the 
cause-of-death classi˜cation is provided in Technical Notes
 at 
the end of this report. Mortality data on speci˜c demographic and medical characteristics cover all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

10. Neonatal hemorrhage Ł The decrease in life expectancy at birth for the total 
population in 2017 was mainly due to increases in mortality 
from unintentional injuries, suicide, diabetes, Alzheimer 
disease, and In˚uenza and pneumonia, with unintentional 
injuries making the largest contribution. Ł The difference in life expectancy between the non-Hispanic 

white and non-Hispanic black populations decreased by 0.1 
year, from 3.7 years in 2016 to 3.6 years in 2017. 
Ł Among external cause-of-injury deaths, unintentional 

poisoning has been the leading mechanism of injury 

mortality since 2011. Ł The difference in the infant mortality rate of 5.79 infant 
deaths per 1,000 live births in 2017 from 5.87 in 2016 was 
not statistically signi˜cant. Ł The 10 leading causes of infant death in 2017 remained the 
same as in 2016, although 4 causes changed ranks. Ł The age-adjusted death rate increased 0.4% in 2017 after a 
decrease in 2016. Ł Differences in mortality persisted between the non-Hispanic 
black and non-Hispanic white populations. The age-adjusted 
death rate has been 1.2 times greater for the non-Hispanic 

black population than for the non-Hispanic white population 

since 2008. Ł The age-adjusted death rate for the non-Hispanic white 

population was 1.4 times greater than for the Hispanic 
population. This difference has remained unchanged since 
2010. Ł Life expectancy for the total population decreased 0.1 year 
from 78.7 in 2016 to 78.6 in 2017. Ł Life expectancy for females was 5.0 years higher than 
for males. The difference in life expectancy between the 
sexes has narrowed since 1979, when it was 7.8 years, 

but it increased 0.1 year in 2017 from 2016, the second 
consecutive increase. Ł In 2017 compared with 2016, life expectancy decreased 
for non-Hispanic white males (0.1 year) and non-Hispanic 
black males (0.1 year). Life expectancy for non-Hispanic 
white females, and Hispanic males and females remained 
unchanged. Life expectancy for non-Hispanic black females 
increased 0.1 year. 
Ł The difference in life expectancy between the Hispanic and 
non-Hispanic white populations was 3.3 years in 2017, an 
increase of 0.1 year from 2016. Ł The 15 leading causes of death in 2017 were the same as 
in 2016, although Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis and 
Septicemia exchanged ranks. Ł Age-adjusted death rates increased signi˜cantly in 2017 
from 2016 for 10 of the 15 leading causes of death, 
including unintentional injuries, Chronic lower respiratory 

diseases, stroke, Alzheimer disease, diabetes, In˚uenza and 
pneumonia, suicide, Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, 
hypertension, and Parkinson disease. Signi˜cant decreases 
occurred in 2017 from 2016 for 1 of the 15 leading causes 
of death: cancer. 
Ł Age-adjusted death rates increased in 2017 from 2016 for 
drug-induced causes (9.6%) and ˜rearm-related injuries 
(1.7%).  National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019 3Measures of mortality in this report include the number of deaths; crude, age-speci˜c, and age-adjusted death rates; infant, 

neonatal, and postneonatal mortality rates; life expectancy; and 
rate ratios. Changes in death rates in 2017 compared with 2016 
and differences in death rates across demographic groups in 
2017 were tested for statistical signi˜cance. Unless otherwise 

speci˜ed, reported differences are statistically signi˜cant. 
Additional information on these statistical methods, random 
variation and relative standard error, the computation of derived 

statistics and rates, population denominators, and the de˜nition 
of terms is presented in Technical Notes
.The populations used to calculate death rates shown in 
this report for 1991Œ2017 were produced under a collaborative 
arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau. Populations for 
2010Œ2017 and the intercensal period 2001Œ2009 are consistent 

with the 2010 census (8Œ16). Re˚ecting the latest guidelines 
issued in 1997 by the Of˜ce of Management and Budget (OMB), 
the 2000 and 2010 censuses included an option for persons to 
report more than one race as appropriate for themselves and 
household members (17); see Technical Notes
 for details on multiple-race reporting and methods used to bridge responses 

for those who report more than one race. Beginning with 
deaths occurring in 2003, some states allowed for multiple-race 
reporting on the death certi˜cate. Multiple-race data for these 
states are bridged to single-race categories; see 
Technical Notes
. Use of the bridged-race process will be discontinued once all 

states collect data on race according to 1997 OMB guidelines 
for the full data year. This report presents mortality statistics for 

Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic 
American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), and non-Hispanic 
Asian or Paci˜c Islander (API) persons. The population data used to compute death rates by race and Hispanic origin in this report are based on special estimation 

procedures and are not true counts (see ﬁRace and Hispanic 

originﬂ in Technical Notes
). This is the case even for the 2000 and 
2010 populations. The estimation procedures used to develop 
these populations contain some error. Smaller population groups 

are affected much more than larger population groups (18). 
Data presented in this report and other mortality tabulations are 
available from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), 
National Vital Statistics System website: https://www.cdc.gov/
nchs/deaths.htm. Availability of mortality microdata is described 

in Technical Notes
.Detailed death data are included in Tables 1Œ15
 of this report. This report also includes supplemental Internet 
Tables 
IŒ1 through IŒ20. Results and DiscussionDeaths and death ratesIn 2017, a total of 2,813,503 resident deaths were registered 
in the United StatesŠ69,255 more deaths than in 2016. The 

crude death rate for 2017 (863.8 deaths per 100,000 population) 

was 1.7% higher than the 2016 rate (849.3) (
Tables A
, 1, 2, 7, and 9). The age-adjusted death rate in 2017 was 731.9 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard populationŠ0.4% higher than the rate of 
728.8 in 2016 (Tables A
 and 1). Age-adjusted death rates should be viewed as relative indexes rather than as actual measures of 

mortality risk. They are constructs that show what the level of 
mortality would be if no changes occurred in the age composition 
of the population from year to year. (For a discussion of age-

adjusted death rates, see Technical Notes
.) Thus, age-adjusted death rates are better indicators than unadjusted (crude) death 
rates for examining changes in the risk of death over a period 
of time when the age distribution of the population is changing. 
Age-adjusted death rates also are better indicators of relative risk 
when comparing mortality across geographic areas or between 
sex or race subgroups of the population that have different age 
distributions; see Technical Notes
. Since 1980, the age-adjusted death rate has decreased signi˜cantly every year except for 

1983, 1985, 1988, 1993, 1999, 2005, 2010, 2013, 2015, and 

2017 (Figure 1) (19).Death rates by race and Hispanic originIn 2017, age-adjusted death rates for the major race and ethnicity groups (Table 1
) were:In 2017, the age-adjusted death rate for the non-Hispanicblack population was 1.2 times that for the non-Hispanic white 
population. The rate for the non-Hispanic white population 
was 1.4 times that for the Hispanic population (Table B
). From 
2016 to 2017, the age-adjusted rate for the non-Hispanic white 
population increased 0.8%, while the rate for the non-Hispanic 
black population did not signi˜cantly change. The difference 
between the Hispanic and non-Hispanic white populations has 
generally been widening since 2006, with the exception of 2009, 
2012, and 2016 (Table 1
, Figure 2) (19).From 2016 to 2017, the age-adjusted death rate increased for non-Hispanic white females (0.9%) and non-Hispanic white 

males (0.6%) (Tables A
 and 1). For non-Hispanic black females, 
the age-adjusted death rate decreased 0.8%. Observed changes 

in age-adjusted rates for non-Hispanic black male and Hispanic 
male and female populations were not statistically signi˜cant. Mortality for Hispanic persons may be somewhat understated because of net underreporting of Hispanic origin on 
the death certi˜cate (by an estimated 3%), while data for the 
non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black populations are not 
affected by problems of underreporting (20,21); see Technical 
Notes. Misclassi˜cation of Hispanic origin on the death certi˜cate 

is relatively stable across age groups (20). Rates for the non-
Hispanic AIAN population should be interpreted with caution 
because of the high percentage of racial misclassi˜cation on 

death certi˜cates (33%). Rates for non-Hispanic API are affected 
much less by underreporting on the death certi˜cate (3%) (20).Ł  Non-Hispanic white population: 755.0 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population Ł  Non-Hispanic black population: 881.0 Ł  Hispanic population: 524.7  4

Of˜ce of Management and Budget (OMB) standards. Data for speci˜ed race or Hispanic-origin groups other than non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black should be interpreted with caution because of inconsistencies in 

reporting these items on death certi˜cates and surveys, although misclassi˜cation is very minor for the Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian or Paci˜c Islander populations; see Technical Notes]

 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019 5For the total non-Hispanic black population in 2017 compared with 2016, age-speci˜c death rates increased for the 
age group 35Œ44. Rates for non-Hispanic black males increased 
for age groups 5Œ14 and 35Œ44. For non-Hispanic black females, 
rates decreased for age groups 15Œ24 and 45Œ54. For the non-Hispanic AIAN population, changes in age-
speci˜c death rates from 2016 to 2017 were not statistically 

signi˜cant. For the total non-Hispanic API population, age-speci˜c rates decreased from 2016 to 2017 for age groups 35Œ44 and 55Œ64. 

For non-Hispanic API females, the age-speci˜c death rate 
decreased for age groups 1Œ4 and 55Œ64.For the total Hispanic population in 2017 compared with 2016, age-speci˜c death rates decreased for the age group  55Œ64. Rates for Hispanic males decreased for the age group 
55Œ64. For Hispanic females, no signi˜cant changes in age-

speci˜c death rates were observed.
Other observed changes from 2016 to 2017 in age-speci˜c 
rates by race and ethnicity and sex were not statistically 
signi˜cant. Death rates for the non-Hispanic AIAN population are not adjusted for misclassi˜cation of race and ethnicity. Given that the 

rates for the non-Hispanic AIAN population are underestimated 
by about 33% (20), disparities in age-adjusted death rates should 
be interpreted with caution when making comparisons across 
racial and ethnic groups. For the non-Hispanic API population, 
death rates also are not adjusted for misclassi˜cation and are Death rates by age and sexFor the total population, age-speci˜c death rates increased signi˜cantly from 2016 to 2017 for age groups 25Œ34, 35Œ44,

 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019 7underestimated by about 3% due to underreporting on death certi˜cates (20). Although the level of underestimation for 
this population is not as great as for the non-Hispanic AIAN 
population, caution should be exercised when interpreting rate 

disparities involving the non-Hispanic API population and other 

groups.Death rates for the Hispanic population are not adjusted for misclassi˜cation (
Technical Notes
). Because these rates are both 
unadjusted for misclassi˜cation and underestimated by about 
3.0% (20), caution should be exercised when interpreting rate 

disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations. Expectation of life at birth and at specified agesLife expectancy at birth represents the average number of years that a group of infants would live if the group was to experience throughout life the age-speci˜c death rates present 

in the year of birth.Life table data shown in this report for 2001Œ2017 are based on a revised methodology ˜rst presented with ˜nal data reported 
for 2008. The life table methodology was revised by changing 

the smoothing technique used to estimate the life table functions 

at the oldest ages. This revision improves on the methodologies 
used previously; see Technical Notes
. The methods used to produce life expectancies by Hispanic 
origin are based on death rates adjusted for misclassi˜cation (see 
Technical Notes
). In contrast, the age-speci˜c and age-adjusted death rates shown in this report for the Hispanic population are 
not adjusted for misclassi˜cation of Hispanic origin. Thus, this 

report shows Hispanic deaths and death rates as collected by the 

registration areas, and these match the deaths and death rates 
produced using the mortality data ˜le. Life tables were generated for both sexes and by each sex for the following populations:  ŁTotal U.S. population
 ŁNon-Hispanic white population ŁNon-Hispanic black population ŁHispanic populationIn 2017, life expectancy at birth for the U.S. population
 was 78.6 years, 0.1 year lower than 2016 (Tables 3
 and 4). The general trend in U.S. life expectancy since 1900 has been one of improvement. However, decreases in life expectancy occurred in 

2015 and 2017, and these were the only decreases in the last 20 
years. In 2017, life expectancy for males (76.1 years) was 0.1 
year lower than in 2016. Life expectancy for females (81.1 years) 

was the same as in 2016. From 1900 through the late 1970s, the 
gap in life expectancy between the sexes widened (3) from 2.0 to 

7.8 years. The gap between sexes has narrowed since its peak in 
the 1970s. In 2017, the difference in life expectancy between the 
sexes increased for the second consecutive year to 5.0 years, a 
0.1-year increase from 4.9 years in 2016. Life expectancy ˜gures by Hispanic origin have been available starting with data for 2006 (22). Life expectancy decreased by 
0.1 year for the non-Hispanic white population (from 78.6 years

Life expectancy for the non-Hispanic black population in 2017 (74.9) was the same as in 2016. The 
difference in life expectancy between the non-Hispanic white and 
non-Hispanic black populations decreased by 0.1 year, from 3.7 

years in 2016 to 3.6 years in 2017 (
Table 4
). The non-Hispanic 
whiteŒnon-Hispanic black gap generally narrowed from 2006 to 
2014, but widened in 2015 and 2016 before decreasing in 2017.Life expectancy for the Hispanic population (81.8) was 
the same as in 2016 (Tables 3
 and 4). Life expectancy was 1.5 years higher in 2017 compared with 2006. The difference in 
life expectancy between the Hispanic and non-Hispanic white 
populations was 3.3 years in 2017, an increase of 0.1 year from 
2016, but the same as in 2014 and 2015 (Table 4
). Prior to 2014, the non-Hispanic whiteŒHispanic gap was widening gradually 
(Table 4
; Figure 4). Among the six Hispanic originŒraceŒsex groups in 2017, 
Hispanic females had the highest life expectancy at birth (84.3 
years), followed by non-Hispanic white females (81.0), Hispanic 
males (79.1), non-Hispanic black females (78.1), non-Hispanic 
white males (76.1), and non-Hispanic black males (71.5) (
Tables 

3 and 4; Figure 5).Life expectancy for two of the six Hispanic-originŒraceŒsex groups decreased in 2017 from 2016. Life expectancy decreased 
0.1 year for both non-Hispanic white males and non-Hispanic 
black males (Table 4
). Life expectancy for non-Hispanic black females increased by 0.1 year. Life expectancy for non-Hispanic 

white females and Hispanic males and females was unchanged.Life expectancy for both males and females was higher by 3 years or more for the Hispanic population than for the non-
Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black populations. Various 

hypotheses have been proposed to explain favorable mortality 
outcomes among Hispanic persons. The most prevalent 
hypotheses are the healthy migrant effect, which argues that 
Hispanic immigrants are selected for their good health and 
robustness; the ﬁsalmon biasﬂ effect, which posits that U.S. 
residents of Hispanic origin may return to their country of 

origin to die or when ill; and the ﬁcultural effect,ﬂ which argues 
that culturally in˚uenced family structure, lifestyle behaviors, 
and social networks may confer a protective barrier against 
the negative effects of low socioeconomic and minority status 
(23,24).Life tables shown in this report may be used to compare life expectancies at selected ages from birth to 100 years.  1960

 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019 9For example, on the basis of mortality experienced in 2017, a person aged 50 could expect to live an average of 31.6 more 
years, for a total of 81.6 years. A person aged 65 could expect 
to live an average of 19.4 more years, for a total of 84.4 years, 
and a person aged 85 could expect to live an average of 6.6 more 
years, for a total of 91.6 years (Table 3
). While life expectancy at some ages decreased from 2016 to 2017 (at ages 90 and 95), life 
expectancy increased at ages 55 and 75 (Table 3
) (3,25).Leading causes of deathThe 15 leading causes of death in 2017 accounted for 80% of all deaths in the United States (Table B
). The leading causes of death in 2017 remained the same as in 2016, although Chronic 
liver disease and cirrhosis, the 12th leading cause of death in 
2016, became the 11th leading cause in 2017, and Septicemia, 
the 11th leading cause of death in 2016, became the 12th leading 
cause in 2017. Causes of death are ranked according to the 
number of deaths; see Technical Notes
 for ranking procedures. By rank, the 15 leading causes of death in 2017 were: Death rates vary greatly by age. As a result, the shifting age 
distribution of a population can signi˜cantly in˚uence changes in

according to the number of deaths, age-adjusted death rates are 

used to depict trends for leading causes of death in this report 
because they are better than crude rates for showing changes in 
mortality over time and among causes of death (
Tables B
 and 
5; Figure 6).From 2016 to 2017, age-adjusted death rates increased signi˜cantly for 10 of the 15 leading causes of death and 
decreased for 1 of the 15 leading causes (Table B
). The rate for the top leading cause of death, heart disease, decreased 0.3% 

in 2017 from 2016, but this change was not signi˜cant (
Tables 
B and 5; Figure 6) (19). The rate for the second leading cause of death, cancer, decreased 2.1%, continuing a gradual but 

consistent downward trend since 1993. Deaths from these two 
diseases combined accounted for 44.3% of deaths in the United 

States in 2017 (Table B
).Leading causes of death that showed signi˜cant increases in 2017 from 2016 were unintentional injuries (4.2%), Chronic 
lower respiratory diseases (0.7%), stroke (0.8%), Alzheimer 

disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.4%), In˚uenza and pneumonia 

(5.9%), suicide (3.7%), Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (1.9%), hypertension (4.7%), and Parkinson disease (5.0%).The observed changes from 2016 to 2017 in the age-adjusted 
death rates for heart disease, kidney disease, Septicemia, and 
Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids were not signi˜cant. Assault (homicide), the 16th leading cause of death in 2017, dropped from among the 15 leading causes of death in 2010, 
but is still a major issue for some age groups. In 2017, the age-
adjusted rate for homicide did not change. Homicide was among 
the 15 leading causes of death in 2017 for age groups under 1 
year (13th), 1Œ4 (4th), 5Œ14 (5th), 15Œ24 (3rd), 25Œ34 (3rd), 
35Œ44 (5th), and 45Œ54 (10th) (19). Although Human immunode˜ciency virus (HIV) disease has 
not been among the 15 leading causes of death since 1997 (26), 

it is still considered a major public health problem for some age 

groups. Historically, for all ages combined, HIV disease mortality 

reached its highest level in 1995 after a period of increase from 
1987 through 1994. Subsequently, the rate for this disease 

decreased an average of 33.0% per year from 1995 through 
1998, and 6.4% per year from 1999 through 2017 (19,27). In 
2017, HIV disease was among the 15 leading causes of death 
for age groups 15˛24 (15th), 25Œ34 (9th), 35Œ44 (10th), 45Œ54 
(14th), and 55Œ64 (14th). Non-Hispanic black femaleNon-Hispanic white maleNon-Hispanic black male06570

 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019 11Enterocolitis due to Clostridium dif˜cile (C. dif˜cile)Ša predominantly antibiotic-associated in˚ammation of the 
intestines caused by C. dif˜cile, a gram-positive, anaerobic, 
spore-forming bacillusŠis of growing concern. The disease is 

often acquired in hospitals or other health care facilities with 
long-term patients or residents (28,29). The number of deaths 
from C. dif˜cile climbed from 793 deaths in 1999 to a high of 8,085 deaths in 2011 (19,27). In 2017, the number of deaths 
from C. dif˜cile was 6,118. In 2017, the age-adjusted death rate for this cause was 1.6 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard 
population, a decrease of 11.1% from the rate in 2016 (1.8). 
In 2017, C. dif˜cile ranked as the 19th leading cause of death 
for the population aged 65 and over. Approximately 87% of 

deaths from C. dif˜cile occurred among people aged 65 and over  (Table 6
).The relative risk of death in one population group compared with another can be expressed as a ratio. Ratios based on age-

adjusted death rates show that males have higher rates than 

females for 13 of the 15 leading causes of death (Table B
), with rates for males being at least twice as great as those for females 

for 3 of these leading causes. The largest ratio was for suicide (3.7). Other large ratios were evident for Parkinson disease (2.3), 

unintentional injuries (2.1), Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis 

and Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids (1.9 each), heart 

disease and diabetes (1.6 each), cancer and kidney disease (1.4 

each), In˚uenza and pneumonia (1.3), Chronic lower respiratory 

diseases and Septicemia (1.2 each), and hypertension (1.1). 

Age-adjusted rates were lower for males than for females for one 
leading cause, Alzheimer disease (0.7). Age-adjusted death rates for the non-Hispanic black population were higher than for the non-Hispanic white 

population for 8 of the 15 leading causes of death (Table B
). The largest ratios were for kidney disease (2.2) and hypertension and 
diabetes (2.1 each). Other causes for which the ratio was high 
include Septicemia (1.7), stroke (1.4), heart disease (1.2), and 
cancer and In˚uenza and pneumonia (1.1 each). For six of the 

leading causes, age-adjusted rates were lower for the non-
Hispanic black population than for the non-Hispanic white 
population. The smallest non-Hispanic black-to-non-Hispanic 

white ratio was for suicide (0.4); that is, the risk of dying from 
suicide was more than two times greater for the non-Hispanic 
white population than for the non-Hispanic black population. Figure 6. Age-adjusted death rates for selected leading causes of death: United States, 1958Œ20170.11.010.0100.01,000.019581960196519701975198019851990199520002005201020152017International Classification of Diseases

National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019Other conditions with a low non-Hispanic black-to-non-Hispanic white ratio were Parkinson disease (0.5), Chronic lower 
respiratory diseases and Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (0.7 

each), unintentional injuries (0.8), and Alzheimer disease (0.9).Leading causes of death in 2017 for the total population and for speci˜c subpopulations are further detailed in a companion 
National Vital Statistics Report on leading causes by age, race, Hispanic origin, and sex (2). Age-adjusted death rates for the non-Hispanic white population were higher than for the Hispanic population for 11 of 
the 15 leading causes of death (
Table B
). The largest ratios were 
for Chronic lower respiratory diseases (2.7) and suicide (2.6). 

Other causes for which the ratio was high include unintentional 
injuries and Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids (1.7 each); 
heart disease, cancer, and Parkinson disease (1.5 each); 

Alzheimer disease, In˚uenza and pneumonia, and Septicemia 
(1.3 each); and stroke (1.1). Age-adjusted rates were lower for 

the non-Hispanic white population than for the Hispanic 
population for diabetes (0.7) and Chronic liver disease and 
cirrhosis (0.8). Other select causesDrug-induced mortalityIn 2017, a total of 73,990 persons died of drug-induced 
causes in the United States (Tables 5
, 6, 8, and IŒ1). This category 
includes deaths from poisoning and medical conditions caused 

by use of legal or illegal drugs, as well as deaths from poisoning 
due to medically prescribed and other drugs. It excludes deaths 
indirectly related to drug use, as well as newborn deaths due to 
the mother's drug use. (For a list of drug-induced causes, see 
Technical Notes
.)In 2017, the age-adjusted death rate for drug-induced causes for the total population increased signi˜cantly, by 9.6% 

from 20.8 in 2016 to 22.8 in 2017 (Tables 5
, 10, and IŒ1). For males in 2017, the age-adjusted death rate for drug-induced 
causes was 2.0 times the rate for females. The rate for drug-

induced causes increased 10.5% for males and 7.0% for females 

in 2017 from 2016. The age-adjusted death rate for non-Hispanic 
white males was 14.4% higher than for non-Hispanic black males 
and 122.6% higher than for Hispanic males. The rate for non-

Hispanic white females was 60.8% higher than for non-Hispanic 
black females and 265.5% higher than for Hispanic females. Among the major raceŒethnicityŒsex groups, the age-adjusted death rates for drug-induced causes increased 
signi˜cantly in 2017 from 2016 for non-Hispanic white males 
(9.0%), non-Hispanic white females (7.5%), non-Hispanic 

black males (22.9%), non-Hispanic black females (14.7%), and 
Hispanic males (13.5%). The rate for Hispanic females did not 
change signi˜cantly. 
Alcohol-induced mortalityIn 2017, a total of 35,823 persons died of alcohol-induced 
causes in the United States (Tables 5
, 6, 8, and IŒ2). This category includes deaths from dependent and nondependent 

use of alcohol, as well as deaths from accidental poisoning by 
alcohol. It excludes unintentional injuries, homicides, and other causes indirectly related to alcohol use, as well as deaths due to 
fetal alcohol syndrome. For a list of alcohol-induced causes, see 
Technical Notes
.The age-adjusted death rate for alcohol-induced causes for the total, male, and female populations did not change 
signi˜cantly from 2016 to 2017 (Tables 5
, 10, and IŒ2). For males, the age-adjusted death rate for alcohol-induced causes 

in 2017 was 2.7 times the rate for females. The age-adjusted 
death rate for non-Hispanic white males was 35.8% higher than 
for non-Hispanic black males and 12.4% lower than for Hispanic 
males. The rate for non-Hispanic white females was 69.4% 
higher than for non-Hispanic black females and 74.3% higher 
than for Hispanic females. Among the major raceŒethnicityŒsex groups, the age-adjusted rate for alcohol-induced death increased signi˜cantly in 

2017 from 2016 for non-Hispanic white males (2.8%). The rates 
for non-Hispanic white females, non-Hispanic black males, non-
Hispanic black females, Hispanic males, and Hispanic females 
did not change signi˜cantly. 
Firearm-related mortalityIn 2017, 39,773 persons died from ˜rearm-related injuries in the United States (Tables 5
, 6, 8, and IŒ3). In 2017, the age-adjusted death rate for ˜rearm-related injuries for the total 
population increased signi˜cantly, by 1.7% from 11.8 in 2016 to 

12.0 in 2017 (Tables 5
, 10, and IŒ3). For males in 2017, the age-adjusted death rate for ˜rearm-related injuries was 6.1 times the 

rate for females. The rate for ˜rearm-related mortality increased 
2.0% for males from 2016 to 2017. The rate for females in 2017 
was unchanged from 2016. The age-adjusted death rate for non-
Hispanic white males was 54.9% lower than for non-Hispanic 
black males and 73.9% higher than for Hispanic males. The rate 
for non-Hispanic white females was 15.6% lower than for non-
Hispanic black females and 111.1% higher than for Hispanic 
females. Among the major raceŒethnicityŒsex groups, the age-adjusted death rates for ˜rearm-related injuries increased 
signi˜cantly in 2017 from 2016 for non-Hispanic white males 
(3.2%). The rates for non-Hispanic white females, non-Hispanic 
black males, non-Hispanic black females, Hispanic males, and 

Hispanic females did not change signi˜cantly.
Effect on life expectancy of changes in mortality by age and cause of death Changes in mortality by age and cause of death can have 
a major effect on life expectancy. In other words, year-to-year 
changes in life expectancy may be in˚uenced by changes in 
age-speci˜c rates for certain causes, particularly for younger 
age groups. Life expectancy at birth for the total population 
decreased by 0.1 year in 2017 from 2016 primarily because 
of increases in mortality from unintentional injuries, suicide, 
diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and In˚uenza and pneumonia. The 

decrease in life expectancy for the total population was slightly 

offset by decreases in mortality from cancer, heart disease, 

Viral hepatitis, HIV disease, and Septicemia. Life expectancy at 
birth for males decreased 0.1 year due to increases in mortality  National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019  
13from unintentional injuries, suicide, diabetes, and hypertension. These increases were offset somewhat by decreases in mortality 
from cancer, Septicemia, Chronic lower respiratory diseases, 

Viral hepatitis, and HIV disease. For the female population, life 
expectancy remained unchanged due to increases in mortality 
from unintentional injuries, Alzheimer disease, In˚uenza and 

pneumonia, Chronic lower respiratory diseases, and Nutritional 

de˜ciencies, which were offset by decreases in mortality from 
cancer, heart disease, Certain conditions originating in the 

perinatal period, congenital malformations, and Viral hepatitis. 
(For a discussion of the major causes contributing to the change 
in life expectancy, see 
Technical Notes
.) Life expectancy for the non-Hispanic white population in 2017 decreased 0.1 year to 78.5 years (Table 4
). This decrease was due to increases in mortality from unintentional injuries, 
suicide, Alzheimer disease, In˚uenza and pneumonia, and 
diabetes. These increases in mortality were offset to some extent 
by decreases for cancer, Certain conditions originating in the 

perinatal period, Viral hepatitis, congenital malformations, and 
Septicemia. Life expectancy for the non-Hispanic black population remained unchanged in 2017 due to increases in mortality from 
unintentional injuries, stroke, suicide, diabetes, and hypertension, 
which were offset somewhat by decreases for cancer, Certain 

conditions originating in the perinatal period, Septicemia, heart 

disease, and HIV disease.Life expectancy for the Hispanic population in 2017 remained unchanged due to increases in mortality from unintentional 

injuries, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, hypertension, and suicide, 
which were offset somewhat by decreases for cancer, heart 

disease, Viral hepatitis, Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, 
and In situ neoplasms, benign neoplasms and neoplasms of 
uncertain or unknown behavior. 
The difference in life expectancy between the male and 
female populations increased 0.1 year in 2017 to 5.0 years  (Table 4
). The widening in the maleŒfemale life expectancy gap 
was due primarily to greater increases in mortality for the male 
population for unintentional injuries, suicide, diabetes, heart 
disease, and Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period 
(data not shown).Life table partitioning analysis indicates that the difference in 2017 of 3.3 years in life expectancy between the Hispanic and 
non-Hispanic white populations is mostly explained by lower 

mortality for the Hispanic population from cancer, heart disease, 

unintentional injuries, Chronic lower respiratory diseases, and 

suicide. (For a discussion of the major causes contributing to the 
difference in life expectancy, see 
Technical Notes
.)Injury mortality by mechanism and intent
In 2017, a total of 243,039 deaths were classi˜ed as injury-
related (Table 11
). Injury data are presented using the external 

cause-of-injury mortality matrix for ICDŒ10, as jointly conceived 

by the International Collaborative Effort (ICE) on Injury Statistics 

and the Injury Control and Emergency Health Services section, 

known as ICEHS, of the American Public Health Association 

(30,31). The ICD codes for injuries have two essential dimensions: 

the mechanism of the injury and its manner or intent. 
 The mechanism involves the circumstances of the injury (e.g., 

fall, motor vehicle traf˜c, or poisoning). The manner or intent 
involves whether the injury was purposefully in˚icted (where it 

can be determined) and, when intentional, whether the injury 

was self-in˚icted (suicide) or in˚icted upon another person 
(assault). In other report tables showing cause of death, the 
focus is on manner or intent, with subcategories showing 
selected mechanisms. The matrix has two distinct advantages 
for the analysis of injury mortality data: It contains a 

comprehensive list of mechanisms, and data can be displayed by 
mechanism with subcategories of intent, or vice versa. Four 
major mechanisms of injury in 2017Špoisoning, motor-vehicle 

traf˜c, ˜rearm, and fallŠaccounted for 78.7% of all injury deaths 

(Table 11
). A total of 75,354 deaths occurred as the result of 
poisonings in 2017, accounting for 31.0% of all injury deaths 

(Table 11
). The age-adjusted death rate for poisoning increased 
signi˜cantly, by 8.4% from 21.4 deaths per 100,000 U.S. 

standard population in 2016 to 23.2 in 2017. The majority of 

poisoning deaths were either unintentional (86.0%) or suicides 

(8.7%). However, 5.1% of poisoning deaths were of undetermined 

intent. The age-adjusted death rate for unintentional poisoning 
increased 10.4%, from 18.2 in 2016 to 20.1 in 2017, and has 

more than quadrupled since 1999 (data prior to 2017 are not 
shown but are available through CDC WONDER at: https://wonder.cdc.gov/
). Motor vehicle traf˜c-related injuries in 2017 
resulted in 38,659 deaths, accounting for 15.9% of all injury 

deaths (Table 11
). The age-adjusted death rate for these injuries 
decreased 1.7% from 11.7 in 2016 to 11.5 in 2017. In 2017, 
39,773 persons died from ˜rearm injuries in the United States 
(Table 11
), accounting for 16.4% of all injury deaths that year. 

The age-adjusted death rate from ˜rearm injuries (all intents) 
increased 1.7%, from 11.8 in 2016 to 12.0 in 2017. The two 
major component causes of ˜rearm injury deaths in 2017 were 

suicide (60.0%) and homicide (36.6%). The age-adjusted death 
rate for ˜rearm suicide and ˜rearm homicide did not change 
between 2016 and 2017. A total of 37,587 persons died as the 

result of falls in 2017, accounting for 15.5% of all injury deaths 

(Table 11
). The age-adjusted death rate for falls increased 3.2%, 
from 9.5 in 2016 to 9.8 in 2017. The overwhelming majority of 

fall-related deaths (96.7%) were unintentional.State of residenceMortality patterns vary considerably by state (
Tables 12
 and 15). The state with the highest age-adjusted death rate in 2017 
was West Virginia (957.1 per 100,000 U.S. standard population), 

with a rate 30.8% above the national rate (731.9). The state 

with the lowest age-adjusted death rate was Hawaii (584.9 per 
100,000 U.S. standard population), with a rate 20.1% below the 
national rate. The age-adjusted death rate for West Virginia was 

63.6% higher than the rate for Hawaii. Variations in mortality by state are associated with differences 
in socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity composition, as well 

as with differences in risk of speci˜c causes of death (32).  14 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019Infant mortalityIn 2017, a total of 22,335 deaths occurred in children under 
age 1 year (Tables C, D, 14, and 15). This number represents 826 fewer infant deaths in 2017 than in 2016. The ratio of male to female infant mortality rates was 1.2, the same as in 2016. The 
infant mortality rate was 5.79 per 1,000 live births, the neonatal 

mortality rate (deaths of infants aged 0Œ27 days per 1,000 live 

births) was 3.84, and the postneonatal mortality rate (deaths of 

infants aged 28 days through 11 months per 1,000 live births) 
was 1.95 in 2017 (Tables C and 13; Figure 7; see Technical Notes
 for information on alternative data sources). Changes in the 

infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality rates from 2016 to 
2017 were not signi˜cant. The 10 leading causes of infant death in 2017 accounted for 67.8% of all infant deaths in the United States (Table D
). By rank, the 10 leading causes were:1.Congenital malformations, deformations and
chromosomal abnormalities (congenital
malformations)2.Disorders related to short gestation and low birth

weight, not elsewhere classi˜ed (low birth weight)3.Newborn affected by maternal complications 
ofpregnancy (maternal complications)4.Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)5.Accidents (unintentional injuries)6.Newborn affected by complications of placenta,
cord and membranes (cord and placental
complications)7.Bacterial sepsis of newborn8.Diseases of the circulatory system
9.Respiratory distress of newborn
10.Neonatal hemorrhageIn 2017, the 10 leading causes of infant death remained 
the same as in 2016 (27), although SIDS dropped from the 
third leading cause to the fourth leading cause, and maternal complications rose from the fourth leading cause to the third 
leading cause. Also, Respiratory distress of newborn dropped 

from the eighth leading cause to the ninth leading cause, and 

Diseases of the circulatory system rose from the ninth to the 

eighth leading cause. Changes in rates by cause of death among 
the 10 leading causes were statistically signi˜cant for one 
condition. In 2017, unintentional injuries (˜fth leading cause of 

infant death) increased by 10.7% (Table D). Infant mortality rates by race for non-Hispanic origin that are based on the mortality ˜le may be somewhat understated and 
are better measured using data from the linked ˜le of live births 

and infant deaths (33); see Technical Notes
. Infant mortality data presented in this report use the general mortality ˜le, not 
the linked ˜le of live births and infant deaths. Infant mortality 
rates for the population of Hispanic origin are not adjusted for 
misclassi˜cation; see Technical Notes
. Because these rates are not adjusted, caution should be exercised when interpreting rate 

disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations (20). 
In 2017, the infant mortality rate for Hispanic infants was 5.35 deaths per 1,000 live births. By comparison, for non-

Hispanic white infants, the infant mortality rate was 4.61 (a 

decrease of 3.9%), and for non-Hispanic black infants, the rate 
was 11.46 (Table 13
). The infant mortality rate did not change signi˜cantly in 2017 from 2016 for the non-Hispanic black and 
Hispanic populations. Additional mortality tables based on 2017 final dataTrend data on drug-induced causes, alcohol-induced 
causes, and ˜rearm-related injuries by race and Hispanic origin are available as supplemental tables (

61Technical Notes
Nature and sources of dataData in this report are based on information from all death certi˜cates ˜led in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 
and are processed by the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS). Death certi˜cates are completed by funeral directors, 
attending physicians, medical examiners, coroners, or other 
persons legally authorized to certify deaths. Data for 2017 are 
based on records of deaths that occurred during 2017 and 
were received as of July 25, 2018. Data for earlier years can be 
obtained via CDC WONDER (19).The U.S. Standard Certi˜cate of Death, which the states use as a model, was revised in 2003 (34). Prior to 2003, the 
standard certi˜cate of death had not been revised since 1989 

(35). This report includes data for 49 states (Alabama, Alaska, 
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, 
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, 

Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, 
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North 

Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, 
Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, 

Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) 

and the District of Columbia that used the 2003 revision of the 

U.S. Standard Certi˜cate of Death in 2017; and data for West 

Virginia that collected and reported death data in 2017 based on 
the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certi˜cate of Death for 
part of the year and the 2003 revision for the remainder of the 
year.
Because most of the items presented in this report appear largely comparable despite changes to item wording and format 
in the 2003 death certi˜cate revision, data from all states are 
combined unless otherwise stated. Data for American Samoa, 

Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Northern 
Marianas), Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands are included in 
tables showing data by state but are not included in U.S. totals. 
In 2017, Guam, Northern Marianas, and Puerto Rico collected 

and reported death data using the 2003 revision of the U.S. 
Standard Certi˜cate of Death. U.S. Virgin Islands collected and 
reported death data in 2017 using the 1989 revision. American 
Samoa collected and reported death data in 2017 using an older 
pre-1989 version of the death certi˜cate. Mortality statistics are based on information submitted by the jurisdictions and coded by NCHS through the Vital Statistics 

Cooperative Program. For the 2017 data year, all states, the 

District of Columbia, New York City, and Puerto Rico submitted 

mortality medical data electronically to NCHS. American Samoa, 
Guam, Northern Marianas, and U.S. Virgin Islands submitted 
copies of death certi˜cates from which NCHS entered and coded 
all medical data. All states, the District of Columbia, New York 

City, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico submitted mortality 

demographic data electronically to NCHS. All demographic data 

for Guam, Northern Marianas, and U.S. Virgin Islands were 
entered and coded by NCHS from copies of death certi˜cates 
submitted by the territories.Data for the entire United States refer to events occurring within the United States. Data shown for geographic areas are by 
place of residence. Beginning with 1970, mortality statistics for 
the United States exclude deaths of nonresidents of the United 

States. All data exclude fetal deaths.Mortality statistics for American Samoa, Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands exclude deaths 
of nonresidents for each area. For Guam, however, mortality 

statistics exclude deaths that occurred to a resident of any place 
other than Guam or the United States (50 states and the District 
of Columbia).Cause-of-death classificationThe mortality statistics presented in this report were 
compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) 

regulations, which specify that member countries classify and 
code causes of death in accordance with the current revision of 
the International Classi˜cation of Diseases (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and 
classify causes of death. Effective with deaths occurring in  1999, the United States began using the 10th Revision of  this classi˜cation (ICDŒ10) (36). For earlier years, causes of 
death were classi˜ed according to the revisions then in use:  1979Œ1998, Ninth Revision; 1968Œ1978, Eighth Revision, 
adapted for use in the United States; 1958Œ1967, Seventh 
Revision; and 1949Œ1957, Sixth Revision.Changes in classi˜cation of causes of death due to these revisions may result in discontinuities in cause-of-death trends. 
Consequently, cause-of-death comparisons among revisions 

require consideration of comparability ratios and, where 
available, estimates of their standard errors. Comparability 
ratios between the Ninth and Tenth revisions, Eighth and Ninth 

revisions, Seventh and Eighth revisions, and Sixth and Seventh 
revisions may be found in other NCHS reports and independent 
tabulations (37Œ42).ICD not only details disease classi˜cation but also provides 
de˜nitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certi˜cate, 

and the rules for coding cause of death. Cause-of-death data 
presented in this publication were coded by procedures outlined 
in annual issues of the NCHS Instruction Manual (6,43,44). ICD 
includes rules for selecting the underlying cause of death and 
regulations on the use of ICD.Prior to data year 1968, mortality medical data were based on manual coding of an underlying cause of death for each 

certi˜cate, in accordance with WHO rules. Effective with data 
year 1968, NCHS converted to computerized coding of the 
underlying cause and manual coding of all causes (multiple 

causes) on the death certi˜cate. In this system, called Automated 
Classi˜cation of Medical Entities (ACME) (45), multiple-cause 
codes are inputted to computer software that uses WHO rules to 
select the underlying cause. All cause-of-death data in this report 
are coded using ACME.The ACME system is used to select the underlying cause of 
death for all death certi˜cates in the United States. In addition, 
NCHS developed two computer systems as inputs to ACME. 

Beginning with 1990 data, the Mortality Medical Indexing, 
 62  
National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019Classi˜cation, and Retrieval system (MICAR) (46,47) was introduced to automate the coding of multiple causes of death. 
In addition, MICAR provides more detailed information on the 
conditions reported on death certi˜cates than is available through 
ICD code structure. Beginning with data year 1993, SuperMICAR 
(48), an enhancement of the MICAR system, was introduced, 
allowing for literal entry of the multiple cause-of-death text as 

reported by the certi˜er. This information is then automatically 

processed by the MICAR and ACME computer systems. Records 
that cannot be automatically processed by MICAR are manually 
multiple-cause coded and then further processed through ACME 
to determine the underlying cause of death. In 2017, SuperMICAR 
was used to process all of the country™s death records.
In this report, tabulations of cause-of-death statistics are 
based solely on the underlying cause of death. The underlying 
cause is de˜ned by WHO as ﬁthe disease or injury which 

initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death, or 
the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced 

the fatal injuryﬂ (5). The underlying cause is selected from the 

conditions entered by the medical certi˜er in the cause-of-death 
section of the death certi˜cate. When more than one cause or 
condition is entered by the medical certi˜er, the underlying 

cause is determined by the sequence of conditions on the 

certi˜cate, provisions of ICD, and associated selection rules and 

modi˜cations. Generally, more medical information is reported 

on death certi˜cates than is directly re˚ected in the underlying 
cause of death. This is captured in NCHS multiple cause-of-death 
statistics (49Œ51).Tabulation lists and cause-of-death ranking
Tabulation lists for ICDŒ10 are published in NCHS Instruction 
Manual, Part 9, ﬁICDŒ10 Cause-of-Death Lists for Tabulating 

Mortality Statisticsﬂ (52). Beginning with data year 2017, cause-
of-death titles previously appearing in the possessive form 
were changed to the nonpossessive form (e.g., ﬁAlzheimer™s 

diseaseﬂ was changed to ﬁAlzheimer diseaseﬂ). Tabulation lists: 

a) ﬁList of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due 
to Clostridium dif˜cile
ﬂ (the title of which was modi˜ed in 2009 
to include Enterocolitis due to Clostridium dif˜cile), used for 
deaths of all ages; and b) ﬁList of 130 Selected Causes of Infant 

Death,ﬂ used for infants, are used to rank leading causes of 
death for the two population groups (52). Prior to the 2015 data 
year, annual reports of ˜nal data presented cause-of-death data 

based on these two tabulation lists. To streamline cause-of-death 

information shown in this report, beginning with the 2015 data 
year, cause-of-death data are presented for only select causes 

of death. The select causes include all rankable causes as well 
as other select causes based on public health impact and future 
planning. Data for all causes on the ﬁList of 113 Selected Causes 

of Deathﬂ and ﬁList of 130 Selected Causes of Infant Deathﬂ are 
still available from the NCHS website at: https://www.cdc.gov/

. In the list of 
113 causes, the group titles of Major cardiovascular diseases 
(ICDŒ10 codes I00ŒI78) and Symptoms, signs and abnormal 
clinical and laboratory ˜ndings, not elsewhere classi˜ed (R00Œ

R99) are not ranked. In addition, category titles that begin with 
the words ﬁotherﬂ and ﬁall otherﬂ are not ranked to determine the 
leading causes of death. When one of the titles that represents 
a subtotal is rankedŠfor example, Tuberculosis (A16ŒA19)Š

its component parts are not ranked, as in this case, Respiratory 

tuberculosis (A16) and Other tuberculosis (A17ŒA19). For the list 

of 130 causes of infant death, the same ranking procedures are 
used except that the category of Major cardiovascular diseases 

is not on the list. More detail regarding ranking procedures can 
be found in ﬁDeaths: Leading Causes for 2017ﬂ (2).Leading cause-of-death trends discussed in this report are 
based on cause-of-death data according to ICDŒ10 for 1999Œ
2017 and ICDŒ9 for the most comparable cause-of-death titles 
for 1979Œ1998. Although, in some cases, categories from the 
ﬁList of 113 Selected Causes of Deathﬂ are identical to those 
in the earlier ﬁList of 72 Selected Causes of Deathﬂ used with 
ICDŒ9, caution must be used because many of these categories 
are not comparable even though the cause-of-death titles may be 

the same. Tables showing ICDŒ9 categories that are comparable 

with ICDŒ10 titles in the ﬁList of 113 Selected Causes of Deathﬂ 
may be found in the reports, ﬁComparability of Cause of Death 
Between ICDŒ9 and ICDŒ10: Preliminary Estimatesﬂ (39) and 

ﬁDeaths: Final Data for 1999ﬂ (53).Trend data for 1979Œ1998 that are classi˜ed by ICDŒ9 but 
sorted into the ﬁList of 113 Selected Causes of Deathﬂ developed 
for ICDŒ10 are available from the mortality website: https://www.

.Revision of ICD and resulting changes in classi˜cation and rules for selecting the underlying cause of death have important 
implications for the analysis of mortality trends by cause of 

death. For some causes of death, the discontinuity in trend can 

be substantial (37,39). Therefore, considerable caution should 
be used in analyzing cause-of-death trends for periods of time 
that extend across more than one revision of ICD.Codes added or deleted in 2017No ICDŒ10 codes were added or deleted in data year 
2017. Information on categories added or deleted in previous 

years is available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/

Part9InstructionManual2017.pdf (52).Codes for terrorismBeginning with data for 2001, NCHS introduced categories *U01Œ*U03 for classifying and coding deaths due to acts of 
terrorism. The asterisks before the category codes indicate that 

they are not part of ICDŒ10. Deaths classi˜ed to the terrorism 
categories are included in the 113 causes of death list in the 
categories for Assault (homicide) and Intentional self-harm 
(suicide), and in the 130 causes of death list for infants in the 
category for Assault (homicide). Additional information on these 

new categories is available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/

terrorism_code.htm. This report includes two deaths from the 
2017 New York City truck attack that were assigned to terrorism 

categories. Only deaths to residents of the United States are 
included in this report. In any given year, it is possible that deaths resulting from 
acts of terrorism may not be identi˜ed as such if: a) information  National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019  
63identifying an incident as an act of terrorism is not available to the certi˜er at the time of certi˜cation; b) the certi˜cate is not 
updated with the information if it later becomes available; or c) 
of˜cial results of the investigation declaring the incident to be an 
act of terrorism have not yet been made public.Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficileThe number of deaths from Enterocolitis due to Clostridium dif˜cile (C. dif˜cile) (ICDŒ10 code A04.7) was 6,118 in 2017. 
Deaths from this cause increased dramatically from 793 deaths 
in 1999 to a high of 8,085 deaths in 2011 (19). Because of the 
increasing importance of this cause of death (28,29), beginning 
with data year 2006, C. dif˜cile was added to the list of rankable 
causes.Quality of reporting and processing cause of deathQuality of mortality data is largely dependent on proper and thorough completion of death certi˜cates by certi˜ers. Accuracy and completeness of information entered on death certi˜cates 
can vary by state from year to year.
One index of the quality of reporting causes of death is the proportion of death certi˜cates coded to Chapter XVIIIŠ
Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory ˜ndings, 

not elsewhere classi˜ed (ICDŒ10 codes R00ŒR99). Although 
it is impossible to determine which deaths occur from which 
underlying causes, the proportion coded to R00ŒR99 indicates 
the consideration given to the cause-of-death statement by the 

medical certi˜er. This proportion also may be used as a rough 

measure of speci˜city of medical diagnoses made by the certi˜er 
in various areas. The percentage of all reported deaths in the 

United States assigned to Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical 
and laboratory ˜ndings, not elsewhere classi˜ed, decreased 

from 1.22% in 2016 to 1.16% in 2017.Rules for coding a cause or causes of death may sometimes require modi˜cation when evidence suggests it will improve the 
quality of cause-of-death data. Prior to 1999, such modi˜cations 
were made only when a new ICD revision was implemented. 
A process for updating ICD was introduced with ICDŒ10 that 
allows for midrevision changes. These changes, however, may 

affect comparability of data between years for selected causes 
of death.Detail on coding and classi˜cation rule changes can be found in the instruction manual under Part 2, available from: 
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/instruction_manuals.htm
. No new 

coding or classi˜cation rule changes occurred in 2017. Trend 

data for causes of death affected by coding rule changes in 
previous years should be interpreted with caution.Rare causes of deathSelected causes of death considered to be of public health concern are supposed to be routinely con˜rmed by states 
according to agreed-upon procedures between state vital 
statistics programs and NCHS. These causes, termed ﬁinfrequent 

and rare causes of death,ﬂ are listed in the NCHS Instruction Manual, Parts 2a, 11, and 20 (43,54,55). In 2017, some states 
did not con˜rm some or all deaths from rare causes.Codes for drug-induced deathsCauses of death attributable to drug-induced mortality include ICDŒ10 codes D52.1, Drug-induced folate de˜ciency

˜rearm-related injuries exclude deaths due to explosives and 
other causes indirectly related to ˜rearms.Race and Hispanic originThe 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certi˜cate of Death allows the reporting of more than one race (multiple races) (34). 
This change was implemented to re˚ect the increasing diversity 
of the U.S. population and to be consistent with the decennial 
census. The race and ethnicity items on the revised certi˜cate 
are compliant with the 1997 ﬁRevisions to the Standards for 
the Classi˜cation of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity,ﬂ issued 

by the Of˜ce of Management and Budget (OMB) (17). This 
revision replaced standards that were issued in 1977 (56). The 

new standards mandate the collection of more than one race 
where applicable for federal data (17). In addition, the new death 
certi˜cate is compliant with the OMB-mandated minimum set 
of ˜ve races to be reported for federal data (34). Multiple race 
includes any combination of white, black or African American, 
American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), Asian, and Native 
Hawaiian or Other Paci˜c Islander (NHOPI). If two or more 
speci˜c subgroups such as Korean and Chinese are reported, 
these count as a single race of Asian rather than as multiple 
races.The number of states reporting multiple race has increased, from 7 states in 2003 to all 50 states and the District of Columbia 
in 2017 (
Table I
), although West Virginia began collecting 

multiple-race data on death certi˜cates in September. In 2017, 

more than one race was reported for 0.5% of decedents of 
non-Hispanic origin and for 0.9% of Hispanic origin (Table II
). Although still uncommon, multiple races were reported more 
often for younger decedents than for older decedents (3.3% of 
decedents under age 25 compared with 0.8% of decedents aged 
25Œ64 and 0.3% of decedents aged 65 and over). In 2017, no 
decedents were reported as having more than four races.Data from vital records based on the 1989 revision of 
the U.S. Standard Certi˜cate of Death follow the 1977 OMB 
standard, allowing only a single race to be reported (35,56).  The 1977 standard stipulates that states must report a minimum 
set of four races: white, black or African American, AIAN, and 

Asian or Paci˜c Islander (API). Under these standards, data for 
API persons were collected as a single group; that is, data for 
Asian persons were not reported separately from NHOPI persons 

(56). The 1997 OMB guidelines provide for the reporting of Asian 
persons separately from NHOPI persons (17).Multiple-race data were collected and reported for the entire year by 49 states and the District of Columbia. West Virginia 

collected single-race data for part of 2017 and multiple-race data 
for the remainder of the year. Data by race for death certi˜cates 

collecting only one race Šthe source of the numerators for death 

ratesŠare incompatible with population data collected in the 

2000 and 2010 censuses, intercensal estimates for 1991Œ1999 

and 2001Œ2009, and postcensal estimates for 2011Œ2017Šthe 
denominators for the rates. To produce death rates by race, 

the reported population data for multiple-race persons had to 
be ﬁbridgedﬂ to single-race categories. To provide uniformity 

and comparability of data until all data become available in the 

multiple-race format, the responses of those for whom more 
than one race was reported (multiple race) must be bridged 
to a single race. The bridging procedure is similar to that used 

to bridge multiracial population estimates (18,57). Multiracial 
decedents are imputed to a single race (white, black, AIAN, or 
API) according to their combination of races, Hispanic origin, 
sex, and age indicated on the death certi˜cate. The imputation 
procedure is described in detail at: 
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/

data/dvs/Multiple_race_documentation_5-10-04.pdf. Similarly, 

when calculating infant mortality rates, multiracial infants are 
bridged to a single race. The bridging procedure for multiple-
race mothers and fathers is based on the procedure used to 
bridge the multiple-race population estimates (33); see ﬁInfant 
mortality ratesﬂ in this section. Use of the bridged-race process 

will be discontinued once all states collect data on race according 
to 1997 OMB guidelines for the entire year.
Race and Hispanic origin are two distinct attributes and are reported separately on the death certi˜cate. Therefore, data 
shown by Hispanic origin and race are based on a combination of 
the two attributes for the non-Hispanic population. Data shown 
for the Hispanic population include persons of any race. Hispanic 

origin is not imputed if it is not reported.Quality of race and Hispanic-origin dataŠDeath rates for Hispanic, non-Hispanic AIAN, and non-Hispanic API persons 
should be interpreted with caution because of inconsistencies 
in reporting Hispanic origin or race on the death certi˜cate 

compared with censuses, surveys, and birth certi˜cates. Studies 

have shown underreporting on death certi˜cates of non-Hispanic 

AIAN, non-Hispanic API, and Hispanic decedents, as well as 
undercounts of these groups in censuses (20,21,58,59).
A number of studies have been conducted on the reliability of race and Hispanic origin reported on the death certi˜cate by 
comparing it with race and Hispanic origin reported on another 
data collection instrument, such as the census or a survey 

(20,21,60,61). Inconsistencies may arise because of differences 
in who provides race and ethnicity information on the compared 

records. Race and Hispanic-origin information on the death 
certi˜cate is reported by a funeral director as provided by an  National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019  
65informant or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis of 
observation. In contrast, race and Hispanic origin in the census 

or the U.S. Census Bureau™s American Community Survey (ACS) 

is obtained while the person is alive; in these cases, race and 
ethnicity is self-reported or reported by another member of 
the household familiar with the person and, therefore, may be 
considered more valid. A high level of agreement between the 

death certi˜cate and the census or survey report is essential to 

ensure unbiased death rates by race and ethnicity.
Studies (20,59) show that a person self-reported as non-Hispanic AIAN or non-Hispanic API on census or survey records 

was sometimes reported as non-Hispanic white on the death 
certi˜cate. Using the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, 

Arias et al. examined the reliability of race and Hispanic origin 
reported on about 559,007 death certi˜cates compared with that 

reported on 38 Current Population Surveys (CPSs) conducted by 

the Census Bureau for 1979Œ2011 (20,21). Agreement between 
the two sources was found to be excellent for the non-Hispanic 
white and non-Hispanic black populations, both exhibiting CPS-

to-death certi˜cate ratios of 1.00. On the other hand, substantial 
differences were found for other race and ethnicity groups. The 
ratio of CPS to death certi˜cates was found to be 1.33 for the 
non-Hispanic AIAN population and 1.03 for the non-Hispanic  API population, indicating net underreporting on death certi˜cates 

of 33% for non-Hispanic AIAN and 3% for non-Hispanic 

API persons. The ratio of deaths for CPS to death certi˜cates 
for Hispanic persons was found to be 1.03, indicating a net 
underreporting on death certi˜cates for the Hispanic population 
of 3%. The net effect of misclassi˜cation is an underestimation 
of deaths and death rates for the non-Hispanic API, non-Hispanic 
AIAN, and Hispanic populations.In addition, undercoverage of minority groups in the census 
and resultant population estimates introduces biases into death 
rates by race and Hispanic origin (20,21,58Œ61). Unlike the 
1990 census, coverage error in the 2000 census was found 
to be statistically signi˜cant only for the non-Hispanic white

National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019population (overcounted by approximately 1.13%) and non-
Hispanic black population (undercounted by approximately 

1.84%) (60). Overall, the 2010 census coverage error was 
minor, with a net overcount of 0.01%. The net undercounts were 

statistically different from zero for the following groups: non-
Hispanic black (2.07%), non-Hispanic white (Œ0.84%), Hispanic 
(1.54%), and on-reservation AIAN (4.88%) populations. The 

net undercounts were not statistically different from zero for the 

non-Hispanic Asian (0.08%), non-Hispanic NHOPI (1.34%), and 

off-reservation AIAN (Œ1.95%) populations (62).
Data year 1997 was the ˜rst year in which mortality data by Hispanic origin were available for the entire United States. Other races, race not stated, and Hispanic origin not 
statedŠBeginning in 1992, all records coded as ﬁother racesﬂ 
(0.8% of total deaths in 2017) were assigned to the speci˜ed race 
of the previous record. Records for which race was unknown, 

not stated, or not classi˜able (0.2%) were assigned the racial 
designation of the previous record. Records for which Hispanic 

origin was not stated or not classi˜able (0.5%) did not have this 
information imputed.Infant mortality ratesŠInfant deaths in this report are tabulated by the race and Hispanic origin of the decedent. Live 
births, the denominators of infant mortality rates, are tabulated 
by race and Hispanic origin of mother.
In 2017, multiple race was reported on the revised birth certi˜cates of all 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
U.S Virgin Islands, Guam, and Northern Marianas using the 2003 
revision of the U.S. Standard Certi˜cate of Birth (63). American 
Samoa continued to report births based on the 1989 birth 
certi˜cate revision, reporting race according to the 1977 OMB 
standards.Infant mortality rates for the Hispanic-origin population are 
based on numbers of resident infant deaths reported to be of 
Hispanic origin and numbers of resident live births by Hispanic 
origin of mother for the United States. In computing infant 
mortality rates, deaths and live births of unknown origin are 
not distributed among the speci˜ed Hispanic and non-Hispanic 

groups. In the United States in 2017, the percentage of infant 

deaths of unknown origin was 0.9%, and the percentage of live 

births to mothers of unknown origin was 0.8%.Small numbers of infant deaths for speci˜c Hispanic-origin 
groups result in infant mortality rates subject to relatively large 
random variation (see ﬁRandom variationﬂ).Infant mortality rates calculated from the general mortality ˜le for speci˜ed race and Hispanic origin contain errors because 
of reporting problems that affect the classi˜cation of race and 

Hispanic origin on the birth and death certi˜cates for the same 
infant. Infant mortality rates by speci˜ed race and Hispanic 
origin are more accurate when based on the linked ˜le of infant 
deaths and live births (33). The linked ˜le computes infant 
mortality rates using the race and Hispanic origin of the mother 
from the birth certi˜cate in both the numerator and denominator 
of the rate. In addition, the mother™s race and Hispanic origin 

from the birth certi˜cate are considered to be more accurately 
reported than the infant™s race and Hispanic origin from the death 

certi˜cate. On the birth certi˜cate, race and Hispanic origin are 
generally reported by the mother at the time of delivery, whereas 

on the death certi˜cate, the infant™s race and Hispanic origin are 
reported by an informant, usually the mother but sometimes the 
funeral director. Estimates of reporting errors have been made by 

comparing rates based on the linked ˜les with those in which the 
infant™s race and Hispanic origin are based on information from 

the death certi˜cate (33,58).Life tablesThe life table provides a comprehensive measure of the effect of mortality on life expectancy. It is composed of sets 

of values showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical 

group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout 
their lifetime to the age-speci˜c death rates of a particular time 
period, usually a given year. Prior to data year 1997, U.S. life 

tables were abridged and constructed by reference to a standard 

table (64). In addition, the age range for these life tables was 

limited to 5-year age groups ending with age group 85 and over. 

Beginning with ˜nal data reported for 1997, complete life tables 
were constructed by single years of age extending to age 100 
(65), using a methodology similar to that of the 1989Œ1991 
decennial life tables (66). The methodology was again revised 
for data years 2000Œ2007 using a methodology similar to that of 
the 1999Œ2001 decennial life tables (67).Research into the methodology used for the 1999Œ2001 
decennial life tables, which was applied to the 2000Œ2007 
annual life tables, revealed that it is not necessary to model 

(or ﬁsmoothﬂ) the probabilities of death beginning at age 66. 
The observed blended vital statistics and Medicare data for 

ages 66Œ85 are robust enough and do not require additional 
smoothing. Beginning with ˜nal data reported for 2008 (68), the 
life table methodology was re˜ned by changing the smoothing 
technique used to estimate the life table functions at the oldest 
ages. Beginning with the 2008 data year, the methodology used 

to produce the life tables does not model the probabilities of 
death beginning at age 66, but rather at ages above 85 or so. 
See ﬁUnited States Life Tables, 2008ﬂ for a detailed description 

of the new methodology (69). Life table data shown in this report 
for data years 2001Œ2017 are based on the new methodology. 

Because life table values presented in this report for 2001Œ2009 
were re-estimated using the new methodology and revised 

2001Œ2009 intercensal population estimates based on the 

2010 decennial census (16), the values may differ from those 
previously published in annual ˜nal mortality and life table 
reports. Life expectancy values in this report for 2016 were 
revised using ˜nal Medicare data; therefore, these values may 
differ from those previously published (3).Historically, NCHS has produced annual life tables by race 
including the white and black populations but did not produce 
life tables for other racial or ethnic groups. Beginning with data 
year 2006 (originally published elsewhere) (22), NCHS began 
producing life tables by Hispanic origin, after conducting research 

into the quality of race and ethnicity reporting on death certi˜cates 
and developing methodologies to correct for misclassi˜cation of 
these populations on death certi˜cates (20,21). These methods 

that adjust for misclassi˜cation are applied to the production of 
the life tables, but not to the death rates shown throughout this 
report. Life tables by race and ethnicity are shown in this report 
with trend data from 2006 through 2017 (Table 4
). National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019 69Although the life table methodology used produces complete life tables (by single years of age), the life table data shown in this report are summarized in 5-year age groupings.Causes of death contributing to changes in life expectancyA life table partitioning technique was used to estimate causes of death contributing to changes in life expectancy in this 
report. The method partitions changes into component additive 
parts and identi˜es the causes of death having the greatest 
in˚uence, positive or negative, on changes in life expectancy 
(70Œ72).Injury mortality by mechanism and intent
Injury mortality data are presented using the external 
cause-of-injury mortality matrix for ICDŒ10 (
Table 11
). In this framework, cause-of-injury deaths are organized principally 

by mechanism (e.g., ˜rearm or poisoning), and secondarily 
by manner or intent of death (e.g., unintentional, suicide, or 
homicide). The number of deaths for selected causes in this framework 
may differ from those shown in tables that use the standard 
mortality tabulation lists. Following WHO conventions, standard 
mortality tabulations (Table 8
) present external causes of death (ICDŒ10 codes *U01Œ*U03 and V01ŒY89); in contrast, the 
matrix (Table 11
) excludes deaths classi˜ed as Complications 
of medical and surgical care (Y40ŒY84 and Y88). For additional 
information on injury data presented in this framework, see the 

report, ﬁDeaths: Injuries, 2002,ﬂ available from: https://www.cdc.
gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr54/nvsr54_10.pdf (73). Data for later 
years are available through CDC™s WONDER system at: 
https://wonder.cdc.gov/
 or through CDC™s WISQARS at: 
https://www.
cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html
. Implementation of changes
to ICDŒ10 may affect the matrix, requiring modi˜cation of codes
in selected categories. No changes were made to the matrix in
2017. For more information on the latest ICDŒ10 external cause-
of-injury codes included in the matrix, see 
https://www.cdc.gov/
nchs/injury/injury_tools.htm
.Infant mortalityInfant mortality rates are the most commonly used index for measuring the risk of dying during the ˜rst year of life. The 
rates presented in this report are calculated by dividing the 
number of infant deaths in a calendar year by the number of 
live births registered for the same period, and are presented as 
rates per 1,000 or per 100,000 live births. For ˜nal birth ˜gures 
used in the denominator for infant mortality rates, see the report 
ﬁBirths: Final Data for 2017ﬂ (63). In contrast to infant mortality 

rates based on live births, infant death rates are based on the 
estimated population under age 1 year. Infant death rates that 

appear in tabulations of age-speci˜c death rates in this report 
are calculated by dividing the number of infant deaths by the 
July 1, 2017, population estimate of persons under age 1, based 
on 2010 census populations. These rates are presented per 
100,000 population in this age group. Because of differences in the denominators, infant death rates may differ from infant mortality rates.There are two sources of infant mortality data: a) the general 
mortality ˜le and b) the linked ˜le of live births and infant deaths. 

Data from the linked ˜le differ from the infant mortality data 
presented in this report because the linked ˜le includes only 
those events in which both the birth and the death occur in the 

United States, and late-˜led births. Processing of the linked ˜le 

allows for further exclusion of infant records due to duplicates 
and records with additional information that raise questions 
about an infant™s age. Although the differences are usually very 

small, infant mortality rates based on the linked ˜le tend to be 

somewhat smaller than those based on data from the general 
mortality ˜le as presented in this report. The linked ˜le is the 

preferred source for infant mortality by race because it uses the 

mother™s self-reported race from the child™s birth certi˜cate (33), 

which is more reliable than the infant™s race listed on the death 

certi˜cate, and because the numerator and denominator are 
referring to the same person™s race.

Mortality data by injury at work no longer appear in the 
printed version of this report but are available in Tables IŒ8 and IŒ9 from the NCHS website at: 
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68nvsr68_09_tables.pdf.Maternal mortalityMaternal mortality data are not included in this report. The 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certi˜cate of Death 
introduced a checkbox question format with categories to take 

advantage of additional codes available in ICDŒ10 for deaths 
with a connection to pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium. 

As states revise their death certi˜cates, most are adopting the 

checkbox format, resulting in wider adoption of a pregnancy 
status question nationwide and greater standardization of the 
 70 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019particular question used. In 2017, the District of Columbia 
and all states had a separate question (West Virginia adopted 

a separate question mid-year) related to pregnancy status 

of female decedents around the time of their death. The 2003 

standard format of the question or a question that could provide 

comparable information was used by 48 states and the District 

of Columbia for the full year and by West Virginia for part of the 

year. The question used by California only specifies if pregnant 

within the last year. Unlike the other states, it does not indicate 

detail on whether pregnant at the time of death, pregnant 42 days 

before death, or pregnant 43 days to 1 year before death.Adopting a pregnancy status question consistent with the 
standard death certificate increases the identification of maternal 

deaths (74,75). Maternal mortality rates are consistently 

greater for those states with the additional information from 

the separate question than for the states without it. In addition, 

state maternal mortality rates tend to be greater after adopting 

the standard question than before. Some research on this issue 

(75Œ77) indicates that this increase represents an improvement 

in identifying maternal deaths. For example, a study in Maryland 

that used multiple data sources as the standard showed an 

improvement in identifying maternal deaths (from 62% to 98%) 

after adoption of a pregnancy checkbox item consistent with 

the 2003 standard certificate (77). However, growing evidence 

suggests the pregnancy status question may increase false 

reporting of recent pregnancy, especially with increasing age 

(78,79). This may result in over reporting of maternal deaths.Population bases for computing ratesPopulations used for computing death rates and life tables 
shown in this report represent the population residing in the 
United States, enumerated as of April 1 for census years and 

estimated as of July 1 for all other years. Population estimates 

used to compute death rates for the United States for 2017 

are shown for 5-year age groups by race and Hispanic origin 

in Table III
. These estimates are available by single years of 
age from: 
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm (15).Populations used for computing death rates by state, shown 
in Table IV
, represent state postcensal population estimates 
based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2017 (15). 

Rates for Puerto Rico are also based on population estimates 

from the 2010 census as of July 1, 2017, and are provided by the 

Census Bureau (80). Rates for American Samoa, Guam, Northern 

Marianas, and 
Virgin Islands are based on population 
estimates provided by the Census Bureau™s International Data 
Base (81). 
Population estimates for each state and territory are 
not subject 
to sampling variation because the sources used in 
demographic analysis are complete counts.Rates for 2011Œ2017 are based on postcensal population 
estimates consistent with the 2010 census, estimated as of July 

1 (9Œ15). Rates for 2010 are based on populations enumerated 

as of April 1, 2010 (8). Rates for 2001Œ2009 shown in this report 

were revised using revised intercensal population estimates 

based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1 (16). Death 

rates for 2000 are based on populations enumerated as of April 

1, 2000 (82). Rates for 1991Œ1999 are based on intercensal population estimates consistent with the 2000 census levels (83). These estimates were produced under a collaborative 
arrangement with the Census Bureau and are based on the 2000 
census counts by age, race, and sex, modi˜ed for consistency 
with 1977 OMB race categories and historical categories for 
death data (56,84). The modi˜cation procedures are described 

in detail elsewhere (19,57). The bridged population data are 

anticipated to be used over the next few years for computing 
population-based rates by race.Computing ratesExcept for infant mortality rates, rates are on an annual basis per 100,000 estimated population residing in the speci˜ed 
area. Infant mortality rates are per 1,000 or per 100,000 live 

births. Comparisons made in the text among rates, unless 
otherwise speci˜ed, are statistically signi˜cant at the 0.05 level 

of signi˜cance. Lack of comment in this report about any two 
rates does not mean that the difference was tested and found not 
to be signi˜cant at this level.Age-adjusted rates (
R') are used to compare relative 
mortality risks among groups and over time. However, they 

should be viewed as relative indexes rather than as actual 
measures of mortality risk. They were computed by the direct 
methodŠthat is, by applying age-speci˜c death rates (Ri) to the U.S. standard population age distribution (Table V
), as inR˜=PsiPsRii˜where Psi  is the standard population for age group i and Ps  is the total U.S. standard population (all ages combined).Beginning with the 1999 data year, NCHS adopted a new 
population standard for use in age adjusting death rates. Based 
on the projected year 2000 population of the United States, the 
new standard replaced the 1940 standard population that had 
been used for more than 50 years. The new population standard 
affects levels of mortality and, to some extent, trends and group 
comparisons. Of particular note are the effects on race mortality 
comparisons. For detailed discussion, see the report, ﬁAge 

Standardization of Death Rates: Implementation of the Year 2000 

Standardﬂ (85). Beginning with 2003 data, the traditional standard 

million population along with corresponding standard weights 
to six decimal places were replaced by the projected year 2000 

population age distribution (Table V
). The effect of the change is negligible and does not signi˜cantly affect comparability with 
age-adjusted rates calculated using the previous method.All age-adjusted rates shown in this report are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population.Age-adjusted rates for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Marianas were computed by applying the age-
speci˜c death rates to the U.S. standard population. The 2000 
standard population used for computing age-adjusted rates for 
the territories is shown in Table V
.Using the same standard population, death rates for the total population and for each raceŒsex group were adjusted 
separately. The age-adjusted rates were based on 10-year age 

groups. Age-adjusted death rates are not comparable with  crude rates. National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019 71Table III. Estimated population by 5-year age groups, according to race and Hispanic origin and sex: United States, 2017

National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019Random variationThe mortality data presented in this report, with the exception of data for 1972, are not subject to sampling error. 
In 1972, mortality data were based on a 50% sample of deaths 
because of resource constraints. Mortality data, even based on 
complete counts, may be affected by random variationŠthat is, 
the number of deaths that actually occurred may be considered 
as one of a large series of possible results that could have arisen 
under the same circumstances (86,87). When the number of 

deaths is small, perhaps fewer than 100, random variation tends 
to be relatively large. Therefore, considerable caution must be 
observed in interpreting statistics based on small numbers of 

deaths.Measuring random variabilityŠTo quantify the random 
variation associated with mortality statistics, an assumption 
must be made regarding the appropriate underlying distribution. 
Deaths, as infrequent events, can be viewed as deriving from 
a Poisson probability distribution. The Poisson distribution 

is simple conceptually and computationally, and provides 

reasonable, conservative variance estimates for mortality 

statistics when the probability of dying is relatively low (86). 
Using the properties of the Poisson distribution, the standard 
error (SE) associated with the number of deaths (D) is[1]SE (D)   =var(D)=Dwhere var(D) denotes the variance of D.Table IV. Estimated population for the United States, each state, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and

National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019The SE associated with crude and age-speci˜c death rates (R) assumes that the population denominator (P) is a constant and is The coef˜cient of variation or relative standard error (RSE) is a useful measure of relative variation. The RSE is calculated by dividing the statistic (e.g., number of deaths or death rate) into 
its SE and multiplying by 100. For the number of deaths,For crude and age-speci˜c death rates,
Thus,
The SE of the age-adjusted death rate (R) iswhere:  ŁRi is the age-speci˜c rate for the ith age group. ŁPsi is the age-speci˜c standard population for the 
ith age 
group from the U.S. standard population age distribution (see Table V
 and Age-adjusted death rate in the following ﬁDe˜nition of termsﬂ). ŁPs is the total U.S. standard population (all ages combined). ŁDi is the number of deaths for the ith age group.RSE for the age-adjusted rate, RSE(
R ), is calculated by 
dividing SE(R) from Formula 4 by the age-adjusted death rate, R, and multiplying by 100, as inFor tables showing infant mortality rates based on live births (B) in the denominator, calculation of SE assumes random 

variability in both the numerator and denominator. SE for the 

infant mortality rate (IMR) is:where the number of births, B, is also assumed to be distributed according to a Poisson distribution, and

, IŒ5, and IŒ6, which are calculated using population ˜gures that are subject to sampling error.
Suppression of unreliable ratesŠBeginning with 1989 data, an asterisk is shown in place of a crude or age-speci˜c death 
rate based on fewer than 20 deaths, the equivalent of an RSE of 

23% or more. The limit of 20 deaths is a convenient, if somewhat 
arbitrary, benchmark, below which rates are considered to be too 

statistically unreliable for presentation. For infant mortality rates, 

the same threshold of fewer than 20 deaths is used to determine 
whether an asterisk is presented in place of the rate. For age-
adjusted death rates, the suppression criterion is based on the 
sum of age-speci˜c deaths; that is, if the sum of the age-speci˜c 
deaths is less than 20, an asterisk replaces the rate.Con˜dence intervals and statistical tests based on 100 
deaths or moreŠWhen the number of deaths is large, a normal 
approximation may be used in calculating con˜dence intervals 

and statistical tests. How large, in terms of number of deaths, 
is to some extent subjective. In general, for crude and age-
speci˜c death rates and for infant mortality rates, the normal 
approximation performs well when the number of deaths is 100 

or greater. For age-adjusted rates, the criterion for use of the 

normal approximation is somewhat more complicated (4,85,87). 
Formula 7 is used to calculate 95% con˜dence limits for the 
death rate when the normal approximation is appropriate:L(R) = R Œ 1.96(SE(R)) and U(R) = R + 1.96(SE(R)) [7]where L(R) and U(R) are the lower and upper limits of the con˜dence interval, respectively. The resulting 95% con˜dence 

interval can be interpreted to mean that the chances are 95 in 

100 that the ﬁtrueﬂ death rate falls between L(R) and U(R). For example, suppose that the crude death rate for Malignant 
neoplasms is 186.0 per 100,000 population based on 565,469 
deaths. Lower and upper 95% con˜dence limits using Formula 7 
are calculated asL(186.0) = 186.0 Œ 1.96(0.25) = 185.5 and U(186.0) = 186.0 + 1.96(0.25) = 186.5 Thus, the chances are 95 in 100 that the true death rate for Malignant neoplasms is between 185.5 and 186.5. Formula 7 can also be used to calculate 95% con˜dence intervals for the 

number of deaths, age-adjusted death rates, infant mortality rates, 
and other mortality statistics when the normal approximation is 
appropriate by replacing R with D, R, IMR, or others.When testing the difference between two rates, 
R1 and 
R2 (each based on 100 or more deaths), the normal approximation 
may be used to calculate a test statistic, z, such thatRSE(IMR) = 100= 100
11SE(IMR)+DBIMR[6]SE(R1)2 + SE(R2)2R1 Œ R2 z =[8] National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019  
75If |z| ˝ 1.96, then the difference between the rates is statistically signi˜cant at the 0.05 level. If 
|z| < 1.96, then the 
difference is not statistically signi˜cant. Formula 8 can also be used to perform tests for other mortality statistics when the 

normal approximation is appropriate (when both statistics being 
compared meet the normal criteria) by replacing 
R1 and 
R2 with 
D1 and D2, R´1 and R´2, or others. For example, suppose that the male age-adjusted death rate for Malignant neoplasms of trachea, 

bronchus, and lung (lung cancer) is 65.1 per 100,000 U.S. 
standard population in the previous data year (R1) and 63.6 per 100,000 U.S. standard population in the current data year (R2). SE for each of these ˜gures, SE(R1) and SE(R2), is calculated using Formula 4. A test using Formula 8 can determine if the 
decrease in the age-adjusted rate is statistically signi˜cant:Because z = 4.83 > 1.96, the decrease from the previous data year to the current data year in the male age-adjusted death 
rate for lung cancer is statistically signi˜cant.Con˜dence intervals and statistical tests based on fewer 
than 100 deathsŠWhen the number of deaths is not large (fewer 
than 100), the Poisson distribution cannot be approximated by 
the normal distribution. The normal distribution is symmetrical, 

with a range from Œ 
˙ to + 
˙. As a result, con˜dence intervals 
based on the normal distribution also have this range. The 
number of deaths or the death rate, however, cannot be less than 

zero. When the number of deaths is very small, approximating 

con˜dence intervals for deaths and death rates using the 

normal distribution will sometimes produce lower con˜dence 
limits that are negative. The Poisson distribution, in contrast, 
is an asymmetric distribution with zero as a lower boundŠ
con˜dence limits based on this distribution will never be less 

than zero. A simple method based on the more general family of 

gamma distributions, of which the Poisson is a member, can be 

used to approximate con˜dence intervals for deaths and death 

rates when the number of deaths is small (85,87). For more 
information regarding how the gamma method is derived, see  

ﬁDerivation of gamma methodﬂ at the end of this section.Calculations using the gamma method can be made using 
commonly available spreadsheet programs or statistical software 
(e.g., Excel or SAS) that include an inverse gamma function. In 
Excel, the function ﬁgammainv (probability, alpha, beta)ﬂ returns 

values associated with the inverse gamma function for a given 
probability between 0 and 1. For 95% con˜dence limits, the 
probability associated with the lower limit is 0.05/2 = 0.025, 
and with the upper limit, 1 Œ (0.05/2) = 0.975. Alpha and beta 
are parameters associated with the gamma distribution. For 
the number of deaths and crude and age-speci˜c death rates, 
alpha = D (the number of deaths) and beta = 1. In Excel, the following formulas can be used to calculate lower and upper 
95% con˜dence limits for the number of deaths and crude and 
age-speci˜c death rates:L(D) = GAMMAINV(0.025, D, 1) and(0.222)2 + (0.217)265.1 Œ 63.6z == 4.83U(D) = GAMMAINV(0.975, D + 1, 1)Con˜dence limits for the death rate are then calculated by 
dividing L(D) and U(D) by the population (P) at risk of dying (see 
Formula 15).Alternatively, 95% con˜dence limits can be estimated using 
the lower and upper con˜dence limit factors shown in Table VI
. For the number of deaths, D, and the death rate, R,L(D) = L x D and U(D) = U x D  [9]
L(R) = L x R and U(R) = U x R  [10]
where L and U in both formulas are the lower and upper con˜dence limit factors that correspond to the appropriate number of deaths, D, in Table VI
. For example, suppose that 
the death rate for non-Hispanic AIAN females aged 1Œ4 years is 
39.5 per 100,000 and based on 50 deaths. Applying Formula 10, 
values for L and U from
 Table VI 
for 50 deaths are multiplied by 

the death rate, 39.5, such that L(R) = L(39.5) = 0.742219 x 39.5 = 29.3 andU(R) = U(39.5) = 1.318375 x 39.5 = 52.1 These con˜dence limits indicate that the chances are 95 in 
100 that the actual death rate for non-Hispanic AIAN females 

aged 1Œ4 is between 29.3 and 52.1 per 100,000.Although the calculations are similar, con˜dence intervals 
based on small numbers for age-adjusted death rates, infant 
mortality rates, and rates that are subject to sampling variability 
in the denominator are somewhat more complicated (5,87).Refer to the most recent version of the ﬁMortality Technical 
Appendixﬂ for more details: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/

vsus/ta.htm.When comparing the difference between two rates (R1 and R2), where one or both of the rates are based on fewer than 
100 deaths, a comparison of 95% con˜dence intervals may 

be used as a statistical test. If the 95% con˜dence intervals do 

not overlap, then the difference can be said to be statistically 
signi˜cant at the 0.05 level. A simple rule of thumb is: If R1 > R2, then test if L(
R1) > U(
R2), or if 
R2 > 
R1, then test if L(
R2) > U(
R1).  Positive tests denote statistical signi˜cance at the 0.05 level. For 

example, suppose that non-Hispanic AIAN females aged 1Œ4 
have a death rate (R1) of 39.5 based on 50 deaths, and non-Hispanic API females aged 1Œ4 have a death rate (R2) of 20.1 per 100,000 based on 86 deaths. The 95% con˜dence limits for R1 and R2 calculated using Formula 10 would be:L(R1) = L(39.5) = 0.742219 x 39.5 = 29.3 andU(R1) = U(39.5) = 1.318375 x 39.5 = 52.1L(R2) = L(20.1) = 0.799871 x 17.9 = 16.1 and
U(R2) = U(20.1) = 1.234992 x 17.9 = 24.8 76 National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 68, No. 9, June 24, 2019Because R1 > R2 and L(R1) > U(R2), it can be concluded that that the difference between the death rates for non-Hispanic AIAN 
females aged 1Œ4 and non-Hispanic API females of the same age 
is statistically signi˜cant at the 0.05 level. That is, taking into 
account random variability, non-Hispanic API females aged 1Œ4 

have a death rate signi˜cantly lower than that for non-Hispanic 
AIAN females of the same age.This test may also be used to perform tests for other 
statistics when the normal approximation is not appropriate for 
one or both of the statistics being compared, by replacing R1 and R2 with D1 and D2, R´1 and R´2 , or others.Users of the method of comparing con˜dence intervals 
should be aware that this method is a conservative test for 

statistical signi˜canceŠthe difference between two rates may, in 

fact, be statistically signi˜cant even though con˜dence intervals 

for the two rates overlap (88). Caution should be observed 

when interpreting a nonsigni˜cant difference between two rates, 
especially when the lower and upper limits being compared 
overlap only slightly.
Derivation of gamma methodŠFor a random variable X that follows a gamma distribution (y,z), where y and z are the parameters that determine the shape of the distribution 
(89), E(X) = yz and Var(
X) = yz2. For the number of deaths, D,  E(D) = D and Var(
D) = D. It follows that y = D and z = 1, and thus,D ~ (D,1)[11]From Formula 11, it is clear that the shape of the distribution of deaths depends only on the number of deaths.For the death rate, R, E(R) = R and Var(
R) = D/P2. It follows, in this case, that y = D and z = PŒ1, and thus,R ~ (D,PŒ1)[12]A useful property of the gamma distribution is that for X ~ (y,z), X can be divided by z such that X/z ~ (y,1). This converts the gamma distribution into a simpli˜ed, standard 

form, dependent only on parameter y. Expressing Formula 12 in its simpli˜ed form gives:R/PŒ1 = D ~ (D,1) [13]From Formula 13, it is clear that the shape of the distribution of the death rate is also dependent solely on the number of 
deaths.Using the results of Formulas 11 and 13, the inverse gamma distribution can be used to calculate upper and lower con˜dence 
limits. Lower and upper 100(1 Œ ) percent con˜dence limits for 
the number of deaths, L(D) and U(D), are estimated asL(D) = Œ1(D,1)(/ 2) and U(D) = Œ1(D+1,1)(1 Œ  /2) [14]
where Œ1 represents the inverse of the gamma distribution, and D + 1 in the formula for U(D) re˚ects a continuity correction, which is necessary because 
D is a discrete random variable and 
the gamma distribution is a continuous distribution. For a 95% 
con˜dence interval, 
 = 0.05. For the death rate, it can be shown that:L(R) = L(D)/P and U(R) = U(D)/P[15]For more detail regarding the derivation of the gamma method and its application to age-adjusted death rates and other

The death rate used to make 
comparisons of relative mortality risks across groups and over 
time. This rate should be viewed as a construct or an index rather 
than a direct or actual measure of mortality risk. Statistically, 

it is a weighted average of age-speci˜c death rates, where the 
weights represent the ˜xed population proportions by age.Age-speci˜c death rateŠDeaths per 100,000 population in a speci˜ed age group, such as 1Œ4 or 5Œ9 years, for a speci˜ed 
period.Crude death rateŠTotal deaths per 100,000 population for a 
speci˜ed period. This rate represents the average chance of dying 
during a speci˜ed period for persons in the entire population.Infant deathsŠDeaths of infants under age 1 year.

Neonatal deathsŠDeaths of infants aged 0Œ27 days.
Postneonatal deathsŠ
Deaths of infants aged 28 daysŒ11
