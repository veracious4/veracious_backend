Foreword
 
Although the expansion
 
of Medicaid has been defeated in the Virginia General Assembly, the 
advocates of Obamacare and for expansion of Medicaid under this program vow to keep this 
issue alive.
 
Last September the Thomas Jefferson Institute published a study that showed the profi
t and loss 
and net worth of the acute care hospitals here in Virginia.  That report was published because the 
largest business group supporting Medicaid expansion was the hospitals.  They said they neede
d 
Medicaid expansion because 
their financial health r
equired it.  This study highlighted the 
financial health of our hospitals and let the readers draw their own conclusions. This report can 
be found
 
here
: 
http://www.th
omasjeffersoninst.org/files/3/Virginia%20Hospital%20Report.pdf
 
And today the hospitals continue to be the major advocates outside of government for a major 
expansion of Medicaid.
 
And that will likely continue to be the case.
 
The Washington Post
 
on March 16
, 2015 ran an article about the shaky financial health of rural 
hospitals in our country.  That is also the case here in Virginia.  Most of the hospitals that are in 
a 
difficult financial situation here in the Commonwealth are the small, rural hospitals.
 
T
his study by Marc Joffe and Jason Fichtner highlight
s
 
the most current financial standing of 

 
as available at the Virginia Hospital Information website. A
nd it shows tha
t,
 
overall, our hospitals are doing very well.  And yet, as these a
uthors point out, the smaller rural 
hospitals are indeed the ones in trouble and they point out that public policy might indeed want 
to help
 
these health care facilities
.  
The authors maintain that 
expanding Medicaid is not the
 
best
 
way to help these hospi
tals.  It would be better, these authors argue, for our state to spend more 
on these hospitals directly rather than expand Medicaid.
 
This study shows how the for
-
profit and non
-
profit hospitals are doing financially.  The overall 
net income for the for
-
pro
fit hospitals was $243 million in 2013 (see page 4) and for the non
-
profit hospitals the net income was over $1 billion in 2013 (see page 6).  And the authors also 

non
-
profit hospitals (pages 8, 9 and 10).
 
Medicaid is already the fastest growing part of our state budget.  And the way that the law is 
crafted, it tells the states that if they expand Medicaid, the federal government will pay 90% of 
the cost for the expa
nsion of this major entitlement program.  But it can really do so?
 
Earlier this year, I attended a briefing with Congressman Paul Ryan who now chairs the United 

Ry
an made is very clear that the proposed expansion of Medicaid could not continue at the 
 
i
 
  
promised 90% and that the cost for expansion will have to be reduced to match the current 
payment structure for the rest of Medicaid.  That is basically a 50% 
federal payment and 50% 
state payment.  This means that any expansion of Medicaid in Virginia will end up being 
extraordinarily expensive.
 
This is not the first time the federal government has promised to pay new costs for a federally 
mandated program.
 
 
Th
e 1975 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) imposed new 
conditions on local school systems to provide students with disabilities with a free, appropriate 
public education.
 
 
The American Association of School Administrators has pointed out tha

law proposed that federal funds should cover up to 40% of the excess cost of educating students 

 
 
Today, the federal government covers less than 16 percent of those costs.
 
 
Those who trust promises on Medicaid might consider the r
ecord on IDEA.
 
This study is published by the Thomas Jefferson Institute in order to show that the hospitals in 
Virginia are, overall, doing pretty well financially.  The hospitals that are the main non
-
government advocates for Medicaid expansion are not i
n financial difficulty.
 
This study is provided as a public service so that the debate over health care in general and 
Medicaid expansion specifically can take place with facts in front of our elected leaders and 
others interested in this important issue.  
This study is not meant to support or oppose any 
specific legislation and does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Thomas Jefferson Institute 
or its Board of Directors.

Hospitals and the Proposed Virginia Medicaid Expansion
 
 
By Marc D. Joffe and Jason J. Fichtner

The debate over Medicaid expansion under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) often 
revolves around its impact on low income, uninsured adults. But Medicaid does not only benefit 
enrollees; it also benefits various groups of medical providers. Indeed, Medicaid payments are made 
directly to hospitals and other providers.
 
 
Hospitals thus ha
ve a financial incentive to support Medicaid expansion in Virginia and elsewhere. 
After providing some evidence that Virginia hospitals are acting on this incentive, we consider whether 
they should receive additional taxpayer funds through Medicaid. We fin
d that hospitals have traditionally 
acted on the belief that they have an obligation to provide care for economically disadvantaged patients 

-
for
-
profit hospitals are expected to fulfill this traditional obligation in return for the 
ben
efits that derive from their not
-
for
-
profit status. Further, we find that 

 
by and large 
-
 
hospitals can 

 
 
Hospital Support for Medicaid Expansion
 
 
Of the $7 billion the Virginia 
Medicaid program pays to providers, about $1.5 billion is remitted to 
hospitals. It is expected that these facilities would receive a significant share of additional Medicaid 
payments if the program is expanded. For example, a 2013 Robert Wood Johnson stud
y estimated that 
Virginia hospitals would receive an additional $600 million in 2016 if the state implemented Medicaid 
expansion.
2
 
 
For this reason, hospital administrators are major supporters of Virginia Medicaid expansion. In 
2013, the Virginia Hospital
 
& Healthcare Association (VHHA) Political Action Committee donated 

3
 
The 


 
the only Republican dele
gate to vote 
for Medicaid expansion when it was raised in February 2014.
4
 
 
 
VHHA also commissioned a study from Chmura Economics & Analytics
5
 
that concluded: 
 

industry, provide cost sav
ings for Virginia businesses, and increase household 
spending for those newly insured. Consequently, the Medicaid expansion can 
generate more Virginia jobs and tax revenue

Hospital association lobbying on behalf of Medicaid expansion can best be 
understood in terms of 

6
 
Yandle concluded that new regulations have the 
strongest chance of succeeding when they are supported by two distinct groups: true believers and interest 
groups that can profit fr
om the intervention. The colorful name for this theory stems from the Prohibition 
era when Baptists (who ardently believed in the benefits of temperance) and Bootleggers (who could 
profit from alcohol prohibition by driving out legal distributors and there
by gaining pricing power) found 
themselves on the same side.
 
 
Although Yandle proposed the theory to explain regulation, it has since been applied to other areas 
of rent
-
seeking behavior, such as subsidies. In 2007, Michael Cannon
, health care expert at 
the Cato 
Institute,
 
described an alliance of healthcare access advocates and healthcare provider lobbies supporting 

7
 
This alliance is once again at play 
in Virginia, where hospitals and ot
her providers join with advocacy groups such as
 
the labor union 
supported
 
Virginia Organizing to lobby on behalf of Medicaid expansion.
 
 
A possible objection to the Bootleggers and Baptists analogy is that hospital administrators deserve 
far more respect t
han liquor smugglers. Health care might be viewed as a necessity and service to the 
public welfare, while alcohol viewed as a guilty pleasure. But the simple fact that a lobbying group is 

t attempt to extract rents (excess 
returns) for its work. And, when a provider group seeks to extract rents for its service, it is reasonable for 
academic researchers to identify its rent seeking behavior.
 
 
A further objection is that most hospitals operat
e as not
-
for
-
profits creating the presumption that 
management is primarily motivated by non
-
pecuniary concerns. We will question that presumption 
below, and offer evidence that many not
-
for
-
profit institutions offer their stakeholders opportunities for 
fin
ancial gain.
 
 
Charity Care and Medicaid: Some Historical Perspective
 
Charity care 

 
the provision of medical services to the poor regardless of their ability to pay 

 
has a 

professional duties in the American 

8
 
In 1932, the Committee on the Costs of Medical 
Care found that the very poorest Americans used hospitals as frequently as the wealthiest Americans, 
because of the avail
ability of charity care. At that time, a combination of pro bono services, philanthropic 
donations that supported the operations of sectarian hospitals and public hospitals funded by local 
governments provided the poor with free or reduced cost access to m
edical facilities
.
9
 
 
Federal involvement in hospital finance began after World War II and greatly increased with the 
1965 passage of Medicare and Medicaid. But even with federal funding, the expectation that hospitals 
would provide charity care remained. I
n 1986, Congress passed the Emergency Medical Treatment and 
Labor Act (EMTALA) requiring all Medicare
-
participating hospitals to provide emergency services 
regardless of ability to pay. Virtually all hospitals in Virginia participate in Medicare.

This b
ackground suggests that access to hospital care for the economically disadvantaged has not 
been a matter of debate.  Instead, the question is one of whether taxpayers should bear a larger burden of 
the charitable care historically provided by hospitals. On
e criterion for making this policy choice is 

 
of the federal poverty line (the income 
ceiling for the proposed Medicaid expansion in Virginia) come to the emergency room, can hospitals 
af
ford to treat them?
 
 
Hospital Income
 
To assess whether hospitals can afford to provide charity care, we can review their income 
statements. In Virginia, hospital financial and operating data are collected by Virginia Health Information 
(VHI), working under
 
contract with the Virginia Department of Health.

Report and various Industry Reports on an annual basis. These data sets may be purchased from VHI,

In aggregate, Virginia hospitals reported strong financial results, with revenues exceeding 
expenditures by almost $1.5 billion, representing a return on income of roughly 8%. 
Hospitals in all three 
ownership categories 

 
for profit, private not
-
for
-
profit and government 

 
reported positive net income.
12
 
That said, some individual hospitals sustained operating losses. Most of these money losing facilities are 
smaller hospitals wi
th less than 100 staffed beds.
 
 
For Profit Hospitals
 
For profit hospitals account for over 20 percent of admissions in the VHI data set.  The biggest 
private hospital company in Virginia is Hospital Corporation of America, which operates hospitals in 
sever
al states and trades on the New York Stock Exchange as HCA Holdings, Inc. (symbol HCA). The 
company reported close to $1.6 billion in net income in 2013. But this number understates the 

buted to minority interests when HCA 
owns less than 100 percent of a given hospital. When net income attributable to non
-
controlling interests 
is included, HCA hospitals reported aggregate net income of $2.0 billion.
13
 
Between January 1, 2012 and 
December 3

14
 
HCA 
has not only performed well for its owners; company executives have also benefited. According to 
company proxy materials, CEO Richard Bracken received $16.5 million in 
total 2013 compensation, 
while the next four highest paid executives received a total in excess of $20 million 

 
averaging $5 
million each.
15
 
 
HCA is not the only profitable hospital company operating in Virginia, as shown in Table 2.

From an economic standpoint, the distinction between for profit and not
-
for
-
profit organizations is 
that the latter do not have an obvious residual claimant. When a for
-
profit firm realizes profits, these 

anagement, acting as an agent for shareholders, may 
decide to retain and reinvest the earnings, rather than distribute them as dividends 

 
but the profits clearly 

-
for
-
profit hospital gro
up, excess 
revenues are not the property of any individual or set of individuals.
 
 
However, the fact that excess income at non
-
profit hospitals does not legally belong to anyone, does 
not mean that they cannot be used for individual benefit. For several de
cades, economists have studied 
residual claimants at not
-
for
-
profit hospitals. In a 1973 
American Economic Review
 
article, Mark Pauly 
and Michael Redisch theorized that physicians enjoy 
de facto
 
control of not
-
for
-
profit hospitals and they 
use their power 
to maximize their practice incomes. Pauly and Redisch conclude that physician control 
will result in hospitals of smaller than optimal size, because incumbent physicians have an incentive to 
restrict the number of new doctors permitted to admit patients to
 
the facility.

The emergence of multi
-
facility health systems has given rise to a class of hospital administrators 
who may have supplanted physicians since Pauly and Redisch published their findings in 1973. A 
Compdata salary survey reported in the 
New Y
ork Times
 
found that the average hospital administrator 
earned more than the average general practitioner, while the average hospital CEO received $386,000 in 
cash compensation plus substantial non
-
cash benefits.
21
 
The story quotes Cathy Schoen of the 
Commo

At large hospitals there are senior V.P.s, V.P.s of 
this, that and the
 

ach one of them is paid more than before, and
 
more than in any other country.

While we urge caution in criticizing the organizatio
nal and compensation policies of not
-
for
-
profit 
hospital groups, we question whether further taxpayer subsidies are required to support these practices.
 
 
Not
-
for
-
profit organizations are required to list executive compensation in their annual IRS reports 
u
sing IRS tax Form 990, which is roughly analogous to Form 1040 but requires much more information. 
The IRS publishes scanned images of these reports and several organizations display them on the 
internet.
22
 
We collected the most recently available Forms 990
 

 
mostly reflecting 2012 data 
-
 
from these 
web sites and reviewed executive compensation levels. These highly compensated executives are listed in 
Table 4. Over 100 additional not
-
for
-
profit hospital executives with Virginia connections were awarded 
betwe
en $500,000 and $1,000,000 in total compensation according to the latest available reports (which 
are mostly from 2012 and 2013). 
 
 
High compensation is not objectionable per se. Firms operating in a competitive environment 
without taxpayer subsidies may d
etermine that highly paid executives add sufficient value to justify their 
compensation. But Virginia hospitals and health systems operate in a highly regulated environment and 
receive a substantial portion of their revenue from governmental sources. Thus,
 
it is possible that high 
executive compensation levels include economic rents as well as residual claims on the excess income of 
their institutions. It is also appropriate for the public and policymakers to consider these compensation 
levels when taxpayer
s 

 
both in Virginia and across the nation 

 
are being asked to increase the support 
they provide to these institutions.
 
 
With respect to subsidies, it is also worth noting that not
-
for
-
profit hospitals receive benefits from 
their status as charitable orga
nizations. Among these benefits are the ability to receive tax deductible 
contributions, exemptions from income, property and sales taxes, and the access to tax
-
exempt bond 
financing (tax
-
exempt bonds pay lower interest rates than taxable bonds with simila
r risk and maturity 
dates).
23
 
Until 1969, not
-
for
-
profit hospitals were explicitly required to provide charity care to be eligible 
for tax exemption. This conditionality was weakened by IRS Revenue Ruling 69
-
545, which allowed 
non

profits to retain their ta

Government
 
(Public)
 
Hospitals
 
 
Medical centers operated by governmental entities are not a major component of the Virginia 
hospital scene. Of the six facilities in this category, 
four are operated by public universities: University of 
Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University. The largest of these facilities are teaching hospitals 
with substantial operating margins and the ability to leverage the services of interns and residen
ts at low 
cost. As appendages of large universities, these hospitals may be expected to have more in common with 
private not
-
for
-
profit medical centers. In fact, the physicians at UVA and VCU are employed by private, 
501(c)3 physician groups. Two UVA physi
cians are on the list of not
-
for
-
profit hospital employees 
earning over $1 million annually in Table 4.
 
 
Virginia does not have large urban public hospitals like Bellevue Hospital in New York or Grady 
Memorial Hospital in Atlanta that would normally be exp
ected to have unusually high concentrations of 
uninsured and Medicaid patients. That said, patients in these categories are not distributed uniformly 
across Virginia hospitals, as we discuss below.  
 
 
Disproportionate Share Hospitals and Hospital Closures
 
Although privately
-
owned Virginia hospitals are performing well in the aggregate, individual 
results vary. Hospitals in less affluent areas admit a greater proportion of uninsured patients and Medicaid 
beneficiaries. Uninsured patients often do not pay the
ir hospital bills, while Medicaid provider payments 
are generally lower than rates paid by Medicare and private insurers
. In 1981, Congress authorized special 
payments to so
-
called Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH) 

 
those that care for an unusually l
arge 
share of uninsured and Medicaid patients.
25
 
 
 
 
Nationally, a number of rural hospitals have shut down since the beginning of 2013. In Georgia, 
four such hospitals closed,
26
 
while Vidant Pungo Hospital in Belhaven, North Carolina closed in July 
2014 afte
r a planned takeover by the city of Belhaven failed to materialize.
27
 
Finally, in Pennington Gap, 
Virginia, Lee Regional Hospital 

 
a recipient of Medicaid DSH funding 
-
 
closed on October 1, 2013.
28
 
 
 
Some ACA supporters
 
have attributed
 
recent hospital closu
res to
 
the
 

Medicaid expansion. The
ir
 
premise is that the Affordable Care Act
 
reduced
 
DSH
 
payments 
as an offset to 
the additional Medicaid reimbursements hospitals would receive from expansion. When certain states, 
includin
g Virginia, declined to expand Medicaid they put their marginal hospitals at risk.
 
As Tara 
Culp
-
Ressler wrote 
at
 
ThinkProgress
:
 
 
 
Providers that serve a high number of poor and uninsured Americans, technically called 


for their care. To compensate, the federal government offers reimbursements for those hospitals 

 
but the Affordable Care Act changes the way the payments are structured. Because the health law 
i
ntended every state to expand Medicaid, and therefore reduce the number of uninsured people who

However, these statements do not comport with the facts. The original Affordable Care A
ct 
legislation phased in DSH reductions starting in FY 2014. The cut for that year was supposed to be $500 
million nationally
31
 

 
about 4.4 percent of the $11.4 billion of DSH allotments in FY 2012. So, Lee 
 
Regional had not been impacted by DSH reductions 
when Wellmont decided to close it.
32
 
Further, 
Congress has subsequently passed two bills that delay the Medicaid DSH reductions, and they are now 
not scheduled to begin until FY 2017.
33
 
Consequently, no recent hospital closures can be accurately 
attributed t


 
since none have occurred.
34
 
 
It is also worth noting that Virginia receives a relatively small amount of Medicaid DSH funds. In 

pportioned nationally.
35
 
Thus, Virginia was allotted 0.8 percent
 
of the national total, although the state accounted for 2.6 percent
 
of US population in 2012.
36
 
Finally, DSH allotment cuts 

 
if and when they occur 
-
 
will not be 
proportional across states. The law directs the Secretary of HHS to make greater cuts in states that have

These states are unlikely to i
nclude those that have 
declined the Medicaid expansion.
 
 
 
If DSH reductions fail to explain the closure of Lee Regional and several out

state hospitals, 
what does? It is more likely that the closures are part of a 
long

term
 
decline in rural hospitals 

 
rather than 
a new phenomenon. According to the HHS Inspector General, 208 rural hospitals closed between 1990 
and 2000. Most of the closures were the result of consolidations or failure of low utilization facilities. On

Low utilization is also a factor in the more recent closures.
39
 
A 2009 analysis of 32 Georgia Critical 
Access Hospitals (CAH) found an ave
rage occupancy rate of only 25 percent.
40
  
The four Georgia 
hospitals that closed since early 2013 were all CAHs 

 
which are eligible for special federal subsidies and 
must be limited to 25 acute beds. In 2011, Kaiser Health News profiled a Louisiana CAH in
 
which fewer 

41
 
 
According to Virginia Health Information
42
, Lee Regional Medical Center had a 33.90 percent 
staffed bed occupancy rate in 2012. This rate was the fourth lowest among the 73 
general hospitals
43
 
in 


 
 
More generally, the VHI data set s
hows a statistically significant correlation (
p
 
< .01) between 
hospital utilization rates and their total margin (i.e., net income as a fraction of total revenue). In other 
words, more highly utilized hospitals tend to be more profitable. There is also a s
tatistically significant 
correlation (again at 
p
 
< .01) between the number of staffed beds and total margin. This is an intuitive 
outcome since hospitals have some level of fixed costs. The bigger the hospital, the more beds across 
which these costs may be
 
divided.
44
 
 
Policy Options
 
 
In free, competitive markets, suppliers that attract fewer customers are more likely to fail.  Even 
though the hospital industry is highly regulated and subsidized, we see much the same outcome. Small, 
low utilization hospitals 
struggle and are sometimes obliged to shut down.
 
 
It is possible to avoid this phenomenon by increasing subsidies to Critical Access Hospitals and 
other small medi
c
al facilities. Policymakers may choose this option 

 
despite its apparent inefficiency 

 
in 
response to a belief in universal service availability. Just as the nation has many under
-
utilized post 
offices in small towns owing to a common belief in the importance of universal access to mail service, it 
may be deemed appropriate to have small, uneco
nomic hospitals in rural areas in the belief that everyone 
should be near a hospital.
 
 
Medicaid expansion is an inefficient way to achieve the goal of keeping small, rural hospitals open, 
because most of the additional funding will go to larger, profitable
 
hospitals that can readily afford to

In theory, Medicaid expansion could expand utilization, but the more likely affect would be to shift some charity 
care admissions to Medicaid

eligible admissions. The core problem of low uti
lization would thus remain.

provide charity care. Instead of further expanding the margins of these larger facilities, policymakers 
should consider focusing incremental expenditures on those hospitals most at risk of closing. This could 
best be d
one outside the context of the Medicaid program.
 
 
Conclusion
 
 
Most Virginia hospitals are profitable, and many can afford to provide their executives with 
generous compensation packages. They thus do not require Medicaid expansion to provide care to 
econom
ically disadvantaged Virginians. The voluntary provision of charity care has deep roots in medical 
ethics and hospital development. Further government involvement in charity care involves subsidizing 
profitable investor
-
owned hospital companies as well as 
many large not
-
for
-
profit hospitals and health 
systems that earn revenues well in excess of their costs.
 
 
Some Virginia hospitals are experiencing financial distress most often because they have 
insufficient volume to cover their fixed costs. If policymake
rs prefer to avoid mergers and closures among 
these low utilization facilities, they can support these hospitals directly rather than providing untargeted 
hospital subsidies through Medicaid expansion.
