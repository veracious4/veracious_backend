16183 The big pictureAt the end of March 2018 there were 690,278 nurses and midwives on our register Œ 495 fewer than at the 
end of March 2017. Between March 2017 and March 2018:The number of nurses and midwives from the UK increased by 1,321The number of nurses and midwives from outside the EEA increased by 1,093 The number of nurses  and midwives from the  EEA decreased by 2,909Ł Between March 2017 and March 2018 we   saw a slight increase in the number of   UK nurses and midwives on our register.   However, this is still 4,266 fewer than   the peak in March 2016.Ł 5,577 fewer people from the EEA   joined our register in 2017/2018 than   in 2016/2017 (a drop of 87 percent).   And 881 more people left it (an   increase of 29 percent). Ł Of the four fields of nursing practice,   the only field that has increased in size is   children™s nursing. All other fields (mental   health nursing, adult nursing and learning   disability nursing) have shown a gradual   decrease over the past five years.Ł While the overall number of nurses on   our register decreased between March   2017 and March 2018, the number   of midwives grew by 473. 4 Why are people leaving?We asked people who had left our register to select their top three reasons for leaving. We had  
3,496 responses. 3,137 of the respondents were from 
the UK, 227 were from the EEA.The top three reasons UK nurses and midwives gave were:Top reasons that EEA nurses and midwives gave for leaving the register:I have retiredI am leaving or have left the UK 52%  gave this as one of their top 3 reasons59%  gave this as one of their top 3 reasonsStaffing levelsBrexit has encouraged me to  consider working outside the UK 26% gave this as one of their top 3 reasons47% gave this as one of their top 3 reasonsMy personal circumstances have changedMy personal circumstances have changed25% gave this as one of their top 3 reasons22% gave this as one of their top 3 reasons5 About our register In order to protect the public, we keep a register of all 
nurses and midwives who meet 
the standards needed to be 
able to practise in the UK. Nurses and midwives need to maintain these standards and revalidate once every three years in order to remain on our register. We currently publish data from our register every six months. How to interpret our dataOur register tells us how many nurses and 
midwives are currently able to practise in the UK. Not everyone on our register will currently be working as a nurse or midwife, or working in the field they are registered in. People from the UK, EEA and outside the EEA all join our register via different routes.  When we say that someone is from the UK, EEA or outside the EEA, we mean that they joined our register via that particular route. Our register is constantly fluctuating and can vary considerably from the start of the month to the end of the month. Our data only 
offers a snapshot in time. The figures showing the number of people on our register are taken from the last day of March in each year. The number of joiners and leavers are cumulative totals from the whole year (1 April Œ 31 March).  6 Size of the registerFIGURE 1: TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE REGISTER BY REGISTRATION TYPERegistration TypeMarch 2014March 2015March 2016March 2017March 2018Midwife31,09132,11333,24634,55435,830Nurse639,028644,441649,668647,605646,637Nurse & midwife10,77010,2579,6428,6147,811SCPHN only10 0 0 0 0680,899686,811692,556690,773690,278The size of the register has been decreasing since it peaked in 2016 and our latest data shows that this trend is continuing.  7 Nurses and midwives from the UKJoining the registerThe number of nurses and midwives from the UK joining our register for the first time has increased by 1,691 Œ the highest it™s been for four years.Leaving the register25,400 UK nurses and midwives left our

not wait for a letter telling us to leave.ﬂ EEA SURVEY RESPONDENTﬁStaffing levels are poor, which leads to

Together these two age groups account  for 56 percent of the total register. This  is consistent with what we have seen in 
previous years.However, we have seen a change in the oldest and youngest age brackets on the register. The proportion of people on our register who are under 30 or over 50 is increasing. This means that the age profile of the register is becoming more polarised.Increases to the over 50 age bracket could be linked to changes in the wider UK workforce, where the number of older workers is growing.FIGURE 9: AGE PROFILE OF THE REGISTERAge above 70Age between 66-70Age between 61-65Age between 56-60Age between 51-55Age between 41-50Age between 31-40Age between 21-30Percentage0102030405060708090100Mar-14 Mar-15 Mar-16 Mar-17 Mar-18

decreased, except for in children™s nursing. This data doesn™t tell us what role nurses are currently working in. Nurses can hold more than one qualification and don™t always work in the fields they are registered in.

three reasons for leaving the register from 
 a list of 18 options. 72 percent of the 

respondents were aged 51 and over. We™d 
expect this, because we know a lot of people 
leave the register due to retirement. 
The age profile of UK respondents is different 
to that of EEA respondents. Only 8.2 percent 
of those from the UK were aged between 21 
and 40, whereas around three quarters (77.6 
percent) of those from the EEA were in this 
age group.We surveyed nurses and midwives who left our register 
between June 2017 and 
November 2017 to ask them 
why they left. 3,496 people 
responded to the survey.FIGURE 11: TOP THREE REASONS FOR LAPSING GIVEN BY UK NURSES AND MIDWIVES (N=3,137)ReasonTotal citing this as one of their top three reasons for leavingPercentage citing this as one of their top three reasonsI have retired1,62751.9%Staffing levels82326.2%My personal circumstances changed (For example, I experienced ill health
