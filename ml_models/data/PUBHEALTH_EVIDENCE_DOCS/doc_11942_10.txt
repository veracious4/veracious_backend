 The greatest increases, and the highest overall number of cases, were among young people 20-29, with injection drug use as the primary route of transmission.
 However, the majority (three-quarters) of the 3.5 million Americans already living with hepatitis C are baby boomers, born from 1945 to 1965, who are six times more likely to be infected with hepatitis C than those in other age groups and are at much greater risk for death from the virus.

 Hepatitis C Reported Cases, 2010-2015 View High Resolution Version The number of new hepatitis C infections reported to CDC in 2015 was higher than it’s been in 15 years – having nearly tripled since 2010 (850 new cases were reported in 2010, and 2,436 new cases reported in 2015).
 Because hepatitis C often has few noticeable symptoms, the number of new cases is likely much higher than what is reported.
 Due to limited testing and underreporting, CDC estimates the actual number of Americans newly infected is 34,000.
