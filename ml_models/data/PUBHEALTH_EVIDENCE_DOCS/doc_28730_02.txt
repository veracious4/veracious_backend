 A total of 109 subjects (56 PE and 53 controls) were included in this study.
 PE was defined as self‐reported intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria and those who had had an IELT of 21 excluded erectile dysfunction (ED).
 Depressive symptoms were assessed by BDI questionnaire in which scoring was as follows: 0–13 (no depression), 14–19 (mild‐to‐moderate depression), 20–28 (moderate‐to‐severe depression) and 29–63 (severe depression) (Beck, Steer, &amp; Garbin, 1988).
 2.3 Laboratory tests Plasma serum vitamin B12 levels were assessed in all subjects included in the study.
 Venous blood samples were drawn and kept into EDTA bottles in the morning between 8 and 10 a.m. after an overnight fast of about 10–14 hr.
 The samples were immediately placed on ice and centrifuged within 2 hr from the collection.
 The resulting plasma samples were stored at −70°C until analysed for vitamin B12.
 The vitamin B12 levels were measured using Beckman Coulter DXI800 immunoassays (chemiluminescence) according to the manufacturers' guidelines and provided as ng ml−1.
 2.4 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using a statistical software package SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) and STATA version 11 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
 Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the subject's characteristics.
 Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or number (percentage) when appropriate.
 In the statistical analysis, Student's t‐test and Pearson's method of correlation were used.
 The mean difference of age, BMI and vitamin B12 levels between the groups was determined using Student's t‐test.
 Correlations between non‐normal distributed data were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficient (r).
 Receiver operating characteristic‐derived areas under the curve were estimated to assess the diagnostic accuracy of vitamin B12.
 The receiver operating characteristic curve cut‐off value was estimated with the maximum Youden index.
 In addition, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated.
 Differences were considered significant at p                    INSTITUTIONAL LOGIN &gt;             Change Password        Old Password       New Password     Too Short Weak Medium Strong Very Strong Too Long       Password Changed Successfully Your password has been changed           Create a new account      Email or Customer ID                    Returning user                 Forgot your password?
