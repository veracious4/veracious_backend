This is to counter that.
 "We have serious problems," Gibson said.He told senators there have been widespread improprieties that include "deliberate acts to falsify (appointment) data."
 He also said Department of Veterans Affairs employees are afraid to come forward and raise concerns, and that supervisors are more worried about good performance numbers than about treating veterans.An inspector general investigation into manipulation of data, potential harm suffered by veterans whose care was delayed and possible criminal charges against VA supervisors has reached 70 agency facilities, Gibson said.The acting secretary said he would decide this week on an initial slate of employees who should be punished.Sen.
 Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee that questioned Gibson on Wednesday, released numbers showing overall delays in care for veterans.Gibson took over at the Department of Veterans Affairs as acting secretary after Eric Shinseki was forced to resign May 30, when it became clear the problems at the agency were system-wide.Gibson said that since taking over the agency, the VA has gotten 160,000 veterans more quickly into medical care.To meet growing demands by aging veterans and a new generation from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, he has had to send 250,000 patients to private doctors each month because the VA cannot handle the number seeking care.Gibson also replaced the head of Office of Medical Inspector, whose efforts were found to be ineffectual by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistle-blower complaints.The VA's acting inspector general, Richard Griffin, said in June that some supervisors are under criminal investigation by the Justice Department for manipulating appointment data.It remains unclear how many veterans were harmed by the delays, although at least hundreds of thousands within a year's time were forced to wait longer to see a doctor than the VA's ambitious timetable of 14 days.
 That goal has since been set aside.Gibson has said that 18 veterans died in Phoenix during delays in care at that facility.
 A retired VA doctor who originally alerted the VA to health care delays at the hospital in Phoenix has alleged that 40 veterans died awaiting care.President Obama late last month nominated the former chairman of Procter &amp; Gamble, Robert "Bob" McDonald, a former paratrooper, as the new secretary.
 The Senate will hold a hearing on his confirmation next Tuesday.The VA's 150 hospitals and 820 outpatient clinics treat more than 6 million veterans each year.
