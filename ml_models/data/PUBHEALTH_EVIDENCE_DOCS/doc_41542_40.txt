 It's time to stop the rot by sending in the Royal Navy.
 "If the civilian force can't cope, the navy must stop this crisis becoming a catastrophe.
 "And another committee member, Conservative MP Tim Loughton told the newspaper: "There is a serious security implication, as this is a likely route undesirables who have been fighting in Syria will use if they want to return to the UK.
 "Of course there is now a case for the Royal Navy to be brought in to do border protection in the Channel."

 "The home secretary needs to understand that we're in this situation because of the persistent refusal of our government and others to share responsibility in providing asylum and safe passage to people fleeing desperate situations.
 "This has left people with no other option than to take extreme risks to find safety - often at the hands of ruthless or careless smuggling gangs."

 "Our focus needs to be much better co-operation with the French authorities, and European nations as a whole to create safe and legal routes for those seeking asylum.
 "No one should feel they have no option but to risk their lives in this way."

 A former senior Home Office official has said smugglers are emboldened by the fact that UK lifeboats are rescuing travellers out at sea - with the rescuers then taking them on to dry land where they can claim asylum.David Wood, who used to lead immigration enforcement, warned there could be a tragedy unless the government changed its policy to stop migrants coming rather than rescuing them and landing them in the UK.He said: "Britain's border force, coastguards and lifeboats are being used as a taxi service for migrants.
 "As far as organised crime is concerned, it's de-risked their business."
