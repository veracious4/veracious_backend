 We analyzed the survival outcomes    in patients receiving SRP for radio-recurrent prostate cancer.
 The secondary outcome    was effect of lymph node dissection on survival following SRP.
 Materials and Methods The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registry was used to identify    patients that underwent radical prostatectomy between 1988 and 2010.
 Search identified    2628 patients with prostate cancer that underwent surgery after radiation.
 Following    exclusion, 364 patients remained.
 Endpoints included overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific    survival (CSS).
 Effect of pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) status and number of    nodes retrieved were also studied.
 Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank tests, and Cox-proportional    hazard models were used, and     P  - Linked To County Attributes – Total U.S., 1969-2012 Counties, National Cancer Institute, DCCPS, Surveillance Research Program, Surveillance Systems Branch, Accessed January 6, 2016.View       in Article       Google ScholarMotheral B.
