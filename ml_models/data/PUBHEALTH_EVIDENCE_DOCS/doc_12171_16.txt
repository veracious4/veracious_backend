 It&apos;s big enough where there are a lot of things to do but small enough that you get to know a lot of it&apos;s residents and make good connections with people.
 Unfortunately, the one thing that Naperville lacks is diversity.
 It has increased it&apos;s minority population within the last couple of years but it still lacks the ability to include all those people and make it feel like a more inclusive communityRead 622 ReviewsA+Overall Niche GradeA+Public SchoolsB-Crime &amp; Safety147,411 PopulationAdd to ListView Nearby HomesPlanoCity in Texas 840 reviews#5 Best Cities to Live in AmericaCurrent Resident: Plano, Tx is a Great Place to raise a family!
 People are very friendly and clean.
 I love parks and malls that surround Plano.
 Downtown Plano has a lot to offer for the nightlife; amazing spots to eat, walk and beautiful urban sightseeings are available as well.
 Plano is a quiet place to raise a family, they provide good public education, friendly environment, good food.
 One thing Plano lacks is diversity, which is getting better now.
 People are always involved in some activities, walking their dogs, jogging and most importantly they are active on neighborhood safety.
 Homeowners get together to keep the area safe(night-watch).
 Overall Plano is the best place to make long-lasting memories with your family and friends, I know I did!Read 840 ReviewsA+Overall Niche GradeA+Public SchoolsB-Crime &amp; Safety284,579 PopulationAdd to ListView Nearby HomesBellevueCity in Washington 145 reviews#10 Best Cities to Live in AmericaCurrent Resident: I think Bellevue is a wonderful city to live in.
 It is very clean, the neighborhoods are well kept, and the school system is highly rated.
 The bus system enables accessible transportation and students in public high schools are given unlimited bus cards.
 The diversity in Bellevue is also amazing.
 Families from all over the world move to Bellevue.
 As a high school student, the student body at my school is incredibly diverse, I have friends from Romania, India, Poland, Spain, and many other countries.
 This diversity allows students to have a more open view of the world, which I believe is very beneficial.
 Unfortunately, however, the city of Bellevue is not very affordable, especially in terms of the housing market.Read 145 ReviewsA+Overall Niche GradeA+Public SchoolsB-Crime &amp; Safety142,242 PopulationAdd to ListView Nearby HomesIrvineCity in California 471 reviews#11 Best Cities to Live in AmericaVisitor: I really enjoy this city because of how clean and open the roads are; overall the city feels breathable due to the low amount of tall buildings and offers several places to surround yourself with nature on a hike.
 One of my favorite places to visit is the Irvine Spectrum mall because of the many places to shop, eat and socialize.
 I love coming with my friends and family to take the day off and simply enjoy each others company watching a movie or racing a competitive match on Mario Cart at Dave and Busters!
 The Great Park also has many fun activities like hopping onto the carousel or (my personal favorite) viewing the whole city and become mesmerized by the landscape from a hot air balloon.
 This city is truly one of my favorites and holds many dear memories of me and my loved ones.Read 471 ReviewsA+Overall Niche GradeA+Public SchoolsB-Crime &amp; Safety265,502 PopulationAdd to ListView Nearby HomesSunnyvaleCity in California 237 reviews#17 Best Cities to Live in AmericaWorks Here: Sunnyvale is the city I&apos;ve grown up in, and I love it!
 Sunnyvale has some of the best public schools, starting from elementary all the way up to high school.
 There are a lot of different areas in Sunnyvale to shop, explore, and have fun.
 There are still small businesses in Sunnyvale, such as Zanotto&apos;s Family Market, the fruit stand, and others around the city.
 Sunnyvale is a rather big town, but it has that small town feel.
 You get to know your neighbors and everyone is super friendly.
 For nightlife, downtown is a great place to go, filled with many restaurant choices, bars, nightclubs, and an ice rink in December.
 Over the summer, downtown hosts different bands for free concerts on Wednesdays, bringing the community together even more.
 These are just a few things that make Sunnyvale unique - come visit and see for yourself!Read 237 ReviewsA+Overall Niche GradeAPublic SchoolsB-Crime &amp; Safety152,323 PopulationAdd to ListView Nearby HomesBoulderCity in Colorado 305 reviews#18 Best Cities to Live in AmericaCurrent Resident: Boulder has definitely earned it&apos;s title as my new home.
 Even in the midst of a global pandemic, the entire community from retired residents to business owners to CU students and restaurant workers have banded together to build a sense of hope and togetherness.
 Although the price or rent may seem high, it&apos;s all made up for with a view of the Flatirons from pretty much anywhere in the city.
 Boulder has a great balance of outdoor activities and city life- it&apos;s only a 5 minute drive to the mountains and a 30 minute drive to Denver!

 My parents chose to live here because the schools are good, it has a low crime rate and the cost of living is reasonable.
 Outdoor recreation is abundant such as boating, biking, running, fishing, hiking, swimming, outdoor theater and many, many others.
 There are lots of historic sites.
 The Chisholm Trail runs right through the center of town.
 The Sam Bass cemetery contains graves of people born before the American Revolution.
 Round Rock has the feel of a small town with easy access to larger cities.
 Round Rock is about 23 miles north of Austin proper.
 The food here is the best!
 Everyone knows about Texas barbecue; no food anywhere can even compare.
 The weather is fantastic, with Round Rock boasting about 300 days of sunshine per year.
 The people are friendly and there is a strong sense of community.
 All in all, Round Rock is a great place to live.Read 361 ReviewsA+Overall Niche GradeAPublic SchoolsB-Crime &amp; Safety120,157 PopulationAdd to ListView Nearby HomesCarlsbadCity in California 344 reviews#29 Best Cities to Live in AmericaNearby Resident: Carlsbad is a family-friendly city with many activities to participate in!

 Many attractions lie near this area but it still tends to be a very relaxing environment.
 The attractions here are the WB studio, near disneyland, universal studios, and more!
 Plus the fact that it is around many amazing resturants!
 I love the air quality which is fresh and depending on your neighboorhood everyone is friendly.Read 315 ReviewsAOverall Niche GradeAPublic SchoolsB-Crime &amp; Safety104,275 PopulationAdd to ListView Nearby HomesGlendaleCity in California 189 reviews#108 Best Cities to Live in AmericaCurrent Resident: This is a great city!

 It boasts several shopping malls with lots of wonderful places to eat from sweet to savory.
 There are even breweries too!
 Glendale&apos;s location is near to that of greater Los Angeles with several freeways to get you where you need to go.
 It&apos;s a good mix of city and suburban for those that want the faster paced lifestyle of a city but with the feel of a tight-knit community.
 I grew up in a close by neighboring town but moved to Glendale 3 years ago and I love it.Read 189 ReviewsA-Overall Niche GradeAPublic SchoolsB-Crime &amp; Safety200,372 PopulationAdd to ListView Nearby HomesProvoCity in Utah 1,412 reviews#119 Best Cities to Live in AmericaCurrent Resident: Provo is definitely a college town.
 There&apos;s always something to do here!
 Everyone is generally very social and kind.
 But sadly I have noticed there&apos;s a very harmful perfectionist culture.
 Many people come from all over the United States to attend Brigham Young University.
 It&apos;s an extremely competitive school with high moral standards.
 Now there&apos;s nothing wrong with that, but I&apos;ve noticed how depressed the students tend to get here when they don&apos;t measure up.
 Definitely something that needs to change.
 Other than that though it&apos;s quite pleasant to be here!
 There are tons of hikes and outdoor activities!
 Also Sundance is right up the road from Provo!

 It’s not a big city, but it’s the biggest city in Hidalgo County.
 Every weekend, you’ll find everyone you know in Mcallen, that’s where you go for fun!
 Mcallen has grown so much in the past couple of years businesses wise, it’s so much more developed now.
 Everyone speaks spanish wherever you go, and everyone around you is always a kind stranger.

 What I dislike: the horrible chain restaurants that surround the town (chillys, olive garden, longhorn steakhouse).
 The large amount of fast food places that also surround the town.
 We do not have any local tasty cooking places around here, mostly chain restaurants or fast food joints.
 It would be nice to see something new be built, instead of another Burger King.. Also, there is absolutely no night life here at all.
 Most places are closed by 10 pm.
 Also, why don&apos;t we have a whole foods grocery store or trader joe&apos;s?!?!?
