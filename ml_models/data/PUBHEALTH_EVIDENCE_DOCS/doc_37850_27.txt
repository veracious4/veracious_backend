 By Audrey NobleMarch 19, 2020FacebookEmailPinterestGetty Images FacebookEmailPinterestMore beauty stores are feeling the pressure to close all their locations as the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is continuing to spread.
 Ulta Beauty is the latest major shopping chain to announce that on Thursday, March 19 it will temporarily close all storefronts until March 31.
 "I want to make sure that our guests and associates know there is nothing more important than our collective health and safety," Ulta Beauty CEO Mary Dillon writes in a statement.
 "We look forward to the time when we can re-open our stores, bring our associates back together, and invite you back in to Ulta Beauty.
 "The beauty industry is taking a huge hit during this pandemic, with many professionals losing work and a steady source of income.
