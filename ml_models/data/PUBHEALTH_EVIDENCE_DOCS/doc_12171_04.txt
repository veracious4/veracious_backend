 It’s not a big city, but it’s the biggest city in Hidalgo County.
 Every weekend, you’ll find everyone you know in Mcallen, that’s where you go for fun!
 Mcallen has grown so much in the past couple of years businesses wise, it’s so much more developed now.
 Everyone speaks spanish wherever you go, and everyone around you is always a kind stranger.
 Mcallen is the heart of the Rio Grande Valley, it’s home.Nearby Resident7 months agoOverall ExperienceReportStart Your Review of McAllenRate It!McAllen is a city close to the border of Mexico, due to this it has brought an abundance of hispanic culture in the valley, and has brought diversity to us.
 There is a lot to do from attending concerts, going to the convention center, the Plaza Mall and the movie theaters (especially El Rey, which is a theater located in Downtown McAllen.)
 and the IMAS Museum of Art and Science.
 McAllen has a great school district as well, it has Rowe, McAllen High, Memorial and Lamar Academy which provides students in the district the opportunity to be in the International Baccalaureate program, which is a very rigorous program students can join to challenge themselves academically.
 Many in the McAllen District have achieved to go to many ivy leagues and have become great athletes because of the great school district.
 Overall, McAllen is filled with welcoming, intelligent, and kind people.Former Resident7 months agoOverall ExperienceReportEveryone should agree the roadways and lack of population, make for an easy commute most times of the day.
 Especially when compared to a much larger city, say Austin, San Antonio or Houston.
 Home prices are cheaper here, than most parts of the US.
 Those are the only two advantages of living in the RGV itself.
 Lack of diversity, the boredom factor and the high crime rate are major problems.
 If your palate goes beyond great Mexican food and fast food, you&apos;d better call Saul, because you&apos;re not getting it here.
 It&apos;s boring, too.
 Once past the initial attractions, you&apos;ll be trekking it to San Antonio (often) like we do.
 Crime is high for this size of populace, directly linked to very low wages paid by local employers, I believe.
 Comparing wages via Indeed, etc, always show 18-25 lower than the national average.
 In summation, it would make for a good two week vacation, but young people will escape the area via college or the military.

 It is calculated using the reported number of students and full-time equivalent teachers.
 I would say that a majority of the student body regardless of grade level have very similar academic goals amongst each other which makes the campus even more welcoming to be around as their are kids alongside myself who are hardworking, determined, goal-oriented, and passionate about receiving a good education.

 Most teachers are invested in the class and offer tutoring after school to further support their students.
 However, I feel that IDEA could do more to support their students when selecting a college.
 A lot of my classmates are struggling choosing a college because they were not given good financial aid packages.
 The school, especially the RTTC program, should expose the kids to schools that offer more financial aid and expose the students to free summer away programs since freshman year.

 The main down side of the school is out of the control of the administration.
 Students tend to gossip about petty things that mainly stem from misunderstandings.
 Another downside is that STCA provides less advanced classes and has no clubs due to the fact that it is private and has no monetary support to depend on.
 Despite these things, it still provides opportunity for students to learn not only about God, and the regular lessons,but also about other cultures and perspectives from around the world.
 You meet a lot of international students from countries in Asia, and South &amp; Central America.
 I think it is a great school because I know that the friends that I made are for life, and that the things that I learned will be much more useful in life than any AP course that I could've taken in a charter school.

 's definition of this crime, use caution when comparing to other locations.
 I have enjoyed working with some of my previous coworkers and the fact that I have got to experience working with babies much more.
 I feel I have grown more with this company as a phlebotomist and I have so much more to learn.
 We have a good management team and all employees treat each other with respect.
 i had to leave because i had to go to school full time.
