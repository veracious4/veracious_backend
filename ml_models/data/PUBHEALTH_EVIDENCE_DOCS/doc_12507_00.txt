 In addition, attention is focused on gathering data to better understand the extent of maternal and infant morbidity, adverse behaviors during pregnancy, and long-term consequences of pregnancy.
 Public health surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of outcome-specific data for use in public health practice.
 The public health approach to problem solving includes using surveillance data to identify problems and assess the effectiveness of interventions.
 Without accurate and timely data, public health programs suffer.
 This glossary is available of commonly used terms in public health surveillance and epidemiology.
 The major surveillance systems in the division include the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), the National ART Surveillance System (NASS), and the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System (PMSS).
 CDC also collaborated with organizations to develop the Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) Case Registry, which seeks to improve population-based SUID surveillance in grantee states.
 Reports are generated from these systems on a routine ongoing basis.
 DRH also monitors teen pregnancy and the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions in the United States.
 Point-in-time surveys are conducted to assess reproductive health in developing countries.
 DRH researchers sometimes analyze secondary data on such topics as ectopic pregnancy and hysterectomy.

 Abortion    Abortion  Abortion Surveillance System FAQs MMWR: Abortion Surveillance — United States, 2016  In 2016, 623,471 legal induced abortions were reported to CDC from 48 reporting areas.
 The abortion rate for 2016 was 11.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years, and the abortion ratio was 186 abortions per 1,000 live births.
 Compared with 2015, the total number and rate of reported abortions fell by 2%, and the abortion ratio decreased by 1%.
 Additionally, from 2007 to 2016, the number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions decreased 24%, 26%, and 18%, respectively.
 In 2016, all three measures reached their lowest level for the entire period of analysis (2007-2016).
 Women in their twenties accounted for the majority of abortions in 2016 and throughout the period of analysis.
 The majority of abortions in 2016 took place early in gestation: 91.0% of abortions were performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation; a smaller number of abortions (7.7%) were performed at 14–20 weeks’ gestation, and even fewer (1.2%) were performed at ≥21 weeks’ gestation.
 In 2016, 27.9% of all abortions were early medical abortions (a nonsurgical abortion at ≤8 weeks’ gestation).
 The percentage of abortions reported as early medical abortions increased 113% from 2007 to 2016, with a 14% increase from 2015 to 2016.

 ART includes all fertility treatments in which either eggs or embryos are handled.
 The main type of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF).
 IVF involves extracting a woman’s eggs, fertilizing the eggs in the laboratory, and then transferring the resulting embryos into the woman’s uterus through the cervix.
 These ART data are a rich source of information that can give potential ART users an idea of their average chances of success per ART cycle or ART transfer.
 View the most recent ART success rates.
 Locate fertility clinics near you, learn about the services they provide, the types of patients they see, and their success rates.
 The ART data are also available on www.healthdata.govexternal icon.
