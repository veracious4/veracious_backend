 We sought to evaluate a new laboratory-based risk-stratification tool that incorporates tests for hs-cTn, glucose level and estimated glomerular filtration rate to identify patients at risk of myocardial infarction or death when presenting to the emergency department.METHODS: We constructed the clinical chemistry score (CCS) (range 0–5 points) and validated it as a predictor of 30-day myocardial infarction (MI) or death using data from 4 cohort studies involving patients who presented to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.
 A CCS score of 0 points best identified low-risk participants: the hs-cTnI CCS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 99.5%–100%), with 8.9% (95% CI 8.1%–9.8%) of the population classified as being at low risk of MI or death within 30 days; the hs-cTnT CCS had a sensitivity of 99.9% (95% CI 99.2%–100%), with 10.5% (95% CI 9.6%–11.4%) of the population classified as being at low risk.
 First, we used test parameters (sensitivity and specificity) to identify possible CCS cut-offs for 30-day MI and death via Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, and then the Cox proportional hazards model to provide hazard ratios (HRs; adjusted for age, sex, family history, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking status)19 to support the selected cut-offs.
 The selected CCS cutoffs were then applied to the other 3 population cohorts to assess sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and likelihood ratios.
 In this regard, we provided the CCS algorithm to each site to determine the test performance and descriptive statistics for their emergency department cohort.We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each cohort as well as for the combined population (by adding the number of participants in each cohort) for the low- and high-risk CCS cutoffs.
 We performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for the CCS algorithms for each emergency department population, including sex-specific analysis that assessed the CCS algorithms for the primary outcome, with comparison to hs-cTn concentration alone (low risk: hs-cTnI 26 ng/L or hs-cTnT &gt; 14 ng/L)3,30,33 in the overall emergency department population.
 We generated the ROC curves based on data without smoothing, and we calculated the area under the ROC curves (AUC) correspondingly.
 We performed the statistical analysis using SAS 9.4, MedCalc statistical software, Graphpad prism, R3.2.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing) and StatsDirect statistical software.Ethics approvalThis study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board, the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee, the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee, and the local ethics board of Hamburg (Ethics committee of the Ärztekammer Hamburg, Germany).
 We followed the Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies guideline.ResultsWe included 4245 participants in this study, with 727 (17.1%) having the primary outcome (30-d MI or all-cause death).
 The prevalence of the primary outcome was different between the cohorts (p 50% above the limit of detection);6 the range of detectable hs-cTnI concentrations was 84%–94% and that for hs-cTnT concentrations was 64%–84% (Table 1).
 And across all 4 cohorts, the higher the CCS, the older the participant’s age, the higher the hs-cTn level, the higher the glucose level and the lower the eGFR (Table 2).
 However, among all participants in the 4 cohorts with normal laboratory results and a CCS of 0, there was only 1 participant (male) who had testing with both hs-cTn assays and who had the primary outcome.
 The AUCs for CCS were higher in the Brisbane (hs-cTnI CCS AUC 0.95, 95% CI 0.93–0.97; hs-cTnT CCS AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.87–0.94) and Christchurch (hs-cTnI CCS AUC 0.94, 95% CI 0.92–0.95; hs-cTnT CCS AUC 0.90, 95% CI 0.87–0.92) cohorts compared with the Hamilton (hs-cTnI CCS AUC 0.87, 95% CI 0.85–0.89; hs-cTnT CCS AUC 0.83, 95% CI 0.81–0.85) and Hamburg (hs-cTnI CCS AUC 0.86, 95% CI 0.85–0.89; hs-cTnT CCS AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.81–0.86) cohorts (Supplemental Figure 3, Appendix 1).View this table:View inlineView popupTable 2: Participant characteristics and partitioning per the clinical chemistry score (range 0 to 5 points) at presentation to the emergency department for all cohorts, by tests for cardiac troponin I or T*In the Hamilton cohort, the sensitivity for a CCS of 0 points was 100% (95% CI 97.9%–100%) with hs-cTnI (Table 3) and with hs-cTnT (Table 4).
 A CCS of 1 point yielded a sensitivity close to 99% with both hs-cTn assays.
 The specificity of a CCS of 5 points was higher for hs-cTnI CCS (95.6%, 95% CI 94.1%–96.9%) than for hs-cTnT CCS (90.4%, 95% CI 88.3%–92.2%).View this table:View inlineView popupDownload powerpointTable 3: Diagnostic accuracy of the clinical chemistry score with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I for myocardial infarction or death at 30 days after presentation to the emergency department, by cohortView this table:View inlineView popupDownload powerpointTable 4: Diagnostic accuracy of the clinical chemistry score with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T for myocardial infarction or death at 30 days after presentation to the emergency department, by cohortThe sensitivity of a CCS of 0 points in the Brisbane, Christchurch and Hamburg cohorts with hs-cTnI was 100% (Table 3).
 In each of these cohorts, the point-estimate specificity was greater than 95% with an hs-cTnI CCS of 5 points.
 For a hs-cTnT CCS of 0 points, the point-estimate sensitivity was greater than 99.5%; the point-estimate specificity of a CCS of 5 points with the hs-cTnT assay was greater than 93.9% across the 3 non–North American cohorts (Table 4).
 Because the sensitivity estimates are greater than 99.0%, 378 participants (8.9% of the population) would be classified as low risk using hs-cTnI with CCS and 444 participants (10.5% of the population) using hs-cTnT with CCS.
 Applying a cut-off value for hs-cTnI of less than 5 ng/L alone, the sensitivity was 96.6% (95% CI 95.0%–97.8%) with 25 false negatives, and for hs-cTnT of less than 6 ng/L alone, the sensitivity was 98.2% (95% CI 97.0%–99.0%) with 13 false negatives.
 The specificity of a CCS of 5 points was 96.6% (95% CI 96.0%–97.2%) with a PPV of 75.1% (95% CI 71.3%–78.5%) for hs-cTnI, and a specificity of 94.0% (95% CI 93.1%–94.7%) with a PPV of 61.7% (95% CI 58.1%–65.2%) for hs-cTnT.
 Applying the overall 99th percentile as the cut-off, the specificity was lower for hs-cTnI (&gt; 26 ng/L) at 93.2% (95% CI 92.3–94.0) and for hs-cTnT (&gt; 14 ng/L) at 73.8% (95% CI 72.3–75.2) compared with the respective CCSs of 5.View this table:View inlineView popupTable 5: Performance of the clinical chemistry score for identifying patients at low and high risk for myocardial infarction or death within 30 days after presentation to the emergency department*Assessing the performance of the CCS with regard to sex, in women, the specificity for the primary outcome was higher with a CCS of 5 (hs-cTnI CCS specificity 96.4%, 95% CI 95.3–97.3; hs-cTnT CCS specificity 94.4%, 95% CI 93.1–95.5) compared with using the overall 99th percentile hs-cTn cut-offs (hs-cTnI specificity 93.6%, 95% CI 92.3–94.8; hs-cTnT specificity 76.1%, 95% CI 73.9–78.2).
 Higher specificity with a CCS of 5 was evident in men as well (Supplemental Table 2, Appendix 3).
 Overall, there were no obvious differences between men and women in the performance of the CCS for the primary outcome.For the secondary outcomes, the CCS algorithms also outperformed testing for hs-cTn alone for the index MI diagnosis (i.e., higher sensitivity and higher specificity; Supplemental Table 3, Appendix 3).
 With respect to interventions, there was nearly a doubling per score in the revascularization rate, with a hs-cTnI CCS of 0 yielding 0.79% (95% CI 0.16–2.32) compared with a hs-cTnI CCS of 5 with 26.2% (95% CI 21.8–31.2) revascularization rate (p &gt; 0.05 between hs-cTnI CCS and hs-cTnT CCS; Table 6).
 The sensitivities of the CCS for 30-day unstable angina, MI and death (sensitivity for a hs-cTnI CCS of 0 points 99.3%, 95% CI 98.3–99.8; for a hs-cTnT CCS of 0 points 98.8%, 95% CI 97.6–99.5) were significantly higher than those for hs-cTn alone (sensitivity for hs-cTnI
