 High rates of gene flow among populations within some species, such as the coyote and gray wolf, have suppressed genetic divergence, and where these species hybridize, large hybrid zones have been formed.
 In fact, the phenotype of the endangered American red wolf may be strongly influenced by hybridization with coyotes and gray wolves.
