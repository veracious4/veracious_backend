 Ursolic acid, curcumin and resveratrol were selected for further analyses and administered in vivo via the diet, either alone or in combination, in a mouse allograft model of prostate cancer.
 All possible combinations of these natural compounds produced synergistic effects on tumor size and weight, as predicted in the screens.
 A subsequent untargeted metabolomics and metabolic flux analysis using isotopically labeled glutamine indicated that the compound combinations modulated glutamine metabolism.
 In addition, ASCT2 levels and STAT3, mTORC1 and AMPK activity were modulated to a greater extent by the combinations compared to the individual compounds.
 Overall, this approach can be useful for identifying synergistic combinations of natural compounds for chemopreventive and therapeutic interventions.

 In turn, their low toxicity and capability of inhibiting multiple pathways represents a resourceful long-term strategy for chemoprevention or treatment of cancer.
 For instance, the ability of these compounds to target multiple pathways might be advantageous to limit compensatory signaling feedback loops and cross-talk between cellular pathways and between different cell types inside the tumor microenvironment.
 The vast molecular diversity offered by natural compound libraries represents an invaluable resource for identification of synergistic combinatorial treatments.
 However, the systematic search of synergistic combinations is hampered by the many possible combinations, even for combinations involving only two compounds within a modest pool of candidates.
 For example, a single dose (and single replicate) screening of a chemical library of 100 compounds in combinations of two agents, would require testing 4950 combinations.
 To avoid the extensive experimental exploration of all the possible compound combinations, several methods have been developed aimed at predicting synergistic combinations.
 However, most of these methods focused on the identification of targeted inhibitors for a single enzyme rather than on monitoring the global response of cancer cells.Metabolomics, an emerging field of biomedical and nutrigenomics research,20,21,22 entails the measurement of a comprehensive pool of small molecules, called the metabolome, in biological samples.23,24,25 Besides being nutrients essential for cell growth, in the context of cancer, metabolites represent sensitive markers of major alterations in cancer cell metabolism and contribute to oncogenic signaling.
 Lipid metabolism alteration is considered as another hallmark of cancer cells since lipid metabolizing enzymes are directly regulated by the activity of oncogenic signals.
 The effect of the most promising compounds (UA, CUR and RES) were tested in vivo in a murine allograft model of PCa, as individual and combination treatments.
 All the natural compound combinations resulted in synergistic effects on tumor volume and weight.
 Therefore, we further analyzed the molecular effects of the compounds (administered alone and in combination) in in vitro models of PCa using an untargeted metabolomics approach combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and mass spectrometry (MS).
 A number of metabolic pathways were affected by the synergistic combinatorial treatments and allowed discrimination of those which were unequivocally driven by the individual compounds.
 Moreover, metabolic flux analysis using isotopically labeled glutamine indicated that the combination of UA with either CUR or RES led to a blockade of glutamine uptake by the cancer cells possibly contributing to the efficacy of these combinations in hindering PCa growth.
 Collectively, the approach used in this paper demonstrates that the metabolic response induced by single agent screening alone may guide the development of novel combinatorial treatments from in vitro to in vivo models and could potentially be translated into human studies.ResultsScreening of NCLThe effect of a library of 142 natural compounds (listed in Supplementary Table 1) on cell viability (based on the adenosine triphosphate, ATP, bioluminescence assay) was screened in the HMVP2 mouse PCa cell line.33, 34 HMVP2 cells were screened at three different concentrations (5, 10 and 20 µM) and three time points (12, 24 and 48 h).
 Z-factors were calculated to evaluate cell response (based on ATP suppression) following exposure to the natural compounds.
 A Z-factor value greater than 0.5 was considered a very good response.
 The 20 µM treatment resulted in the highest number of compounds with Z-factors greater than 0.5 and ATP values lower than 0.5 (indicating good suppression) and was therefore selected as the best dose for the selection of the top hits (Fig.
 1, ATP only).
 ATP and the derived Z-factors for all treatments and all doses are included in Supplementary Table 1.
 1).
 Notably, after 12 h of treatment at the 20 µM dose, the majority of the natural compounds under study induced a greater suppression of ATP levels compared to untreated (solvent control) samples than longer treatments at the same dose (Fig.
 1).
 Moreover, the top hits (selected based on the highest Z-factor) were very consistent regardless of the treatment dose (Supplementary Table 1) and include shikonin, dioscin, amygdalin, UA, and oridonin (only for 24 and 48 h of treatment).
 Shikonin and dioscin were highly effective at all time points and all doses; however, no differences in ATP suppression levels were observed under the experimental conditions for these two compounds (even at lower doses of 5 and 10 µM, as shown in Supplementary Table 1).
 These results are likely due to the concentrations being too high.
 Therefore, shikonin and dioscin were not granted further investigation in the metabolic analysis and will be further characterized to determine a more appropriate concentration range.
 In spite of the high Z-factor values, amygdalin was not selected as a top hit in this study due to the known ineffectiveness as a cancer treatment.35 UA was selected as the top hit for further combinatorial treatment studies, as this compound overall resulted in better outcomes than oridonin.Fig.
 1Screening of a natural compound library.
 HMVP2 cell viability following treatment with a library of natural compounds was screened using the ATP bioluminescence assay.
 HMVP2 cells were treated for 12 (blue), 24 (red) and 48 h (green) with a library of natural compounds (single agent) at the dose of 5, 10 or 20 µM (only the latter dose is shown in the figure).
 Natural compounds are sorted according to increasing ATP bioluminescence values of the 12 h time-point (list of compounds is included in Supplementary Table 1).
 Relative ATP levels (ATP level in treated samples normalized by ATP level of untreated samples) as averages of four replicates are shownFull size image We next performed the screen in HMVP2 cells treated with UA (top hit from the individual agent screen) in combination with all the agents screened as individual treatments (both agents used at 20 µM for 12, 24 and 48 h).
 In addition to the HMVP2 cell line, we also performed the screen with the combined treatments in 3 androgen-independent, human PCa cell lines, DU145, PC3 and C4-2B (Supplementary Table 3).
 The experimental ATP-suppression values for the combined treatments are included in Table 1 (treatments inducing the top 20 highest ATP-suppression levels).
 In HMVP2 cells, the combination of UA with either corosolic acid, aesculin or CUR led to the highest level of ATP suppression (besides the combinations with shikonin and dioscin, excluded for the same considerations mentioned previously for the individual treatment screen).
 Corosolic acid is structurally analogous to UA and was therefore deemed suboptimal for further studies on the effect of the combined treatment.
 CUR and aesculin led to comparable ATP suppression results in HMVP2 cells, however, CUR showed greatly improved ATP suppression in DU145 and PC3 cells and similar ATP suppression in C4-2B cells compared to aesculin (Supplementary Table 3).
 Therefore, CUR was selected as top hit for combination treatment with UA.
 In addition to CUR, we also included in our metabolic studies the combination of UA with another natural compound, RES, which in our primary screen showed little to no ATP suppression (average control-normalized ATP levels between 0.77 and 1.72 in mouse and human PCa cell lines) when administered as a single agent, and a greatly improved ATP suppression following combined administration with UA.
 The combination of CUR and RES was also included for comparison.
 Both combinations of natural compounds showed at least comparable suppression of cell growth/survival (Supplementary Fig.
 1) to the standard therapeutic agents.Table 1 Cell viability modulation following combined treatment with UA and the NCL compoundsFull size table In addition to screening for modulation of cell viability (measured via ATP bioluminescence) following combined treatment with natural compounds, we also monitored generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in all the mouse and human PCa cell lines.
 Notably, screening of ROS levels indicated that UA and RES, administered either as single agents or in combination either decreased or did not affect the ROS levels (compared to control).
 In contrast, CUR alone induced an increase in ROS in most of the cell lines (not significant in PC3), which was suppressed by the combination with UA (Table 2).Table 2 Induction of ROS in treated murine and human PCa cellsFull size table In-vivo effects of UA, CUR and RES administered alone or in combinationAfter selecting the top-hit compounds of interest from the above screens the in vivo effects of the single or combined treatments with the selected natural compounds were evaluated on growth of tumors derived from HMVP2 spheroids in a mouse allograft model.
 HMVP2 cells were grown into spheroids, injected subcutaneously into the flank of male FVB/N mice and allowed to grow for 13 days post-injection before starting the treatment.
 All compounds were given in the diet.
 Tumor volume was monitored starting on the 1st day of treatment and continued until mice were sacrificed on day 32 of treatment.
 Moreover, tumors were weighed at the end of treatment (day 32).
 Notably, the addition of the natural compounds into the formulation of the animals’ diets did not induce changes in either the animals’ body weight (Fig.
 2a) or their daily food consumption (Fig.
 2b).
 Treatments administered as single agents induced modest, but not statistically significant, decreases in both tumor volume and weight (Fig.
 2c and d) as compared to mice on the control diet.
 In contrast, all of the combinations resulted in significantly smaller tumors (both volume and weight) than mice on the control diet.
 Furthermore, the combination of UA + CUR also resulted in significantly smaller tumors (both volume and weight) than those obtained following administration of UA or CUR as single-agent treatment.
 Thus, overall the combination of UA + CUR appeared to be the most effective at inhibiting tumor growth, although all three combinations produced significant combinatorial effects.
 We also compared the effect of the combination of natural compounds on in vivo tumor growth with docetaxel.
 At the doses used for this experiment, docetaxel did not produce any significant effects in the HMVP2 allograft model or in HMVP2 cells treated in vitro (Supplementary Fig.
 2).Fig.
 2In vivo effect on HMVP2 tumor growth of treatment with CUR, UA, RES and their combinations.
 HMVP2 cell spheroids were injected subcutaneously into the flank of male FVB/N mice.
 Mice were fed ad libitum with semipurified AIN76A-based diet containing CUR, UA, RES or their combinations of two natural compounds.
 Body weight (a), food consumption (b), tumor volume (c) and tumor weight (d) are shown as mean ± SEM.
 One-way ANOVA with significance at p  98% pure corosolic acid, epi-maslinic acid, epi-UA, epi-corosolic and maslinic acid were prepared as recently described.58, 59 For all screens, cells in exponential proliferation were seeded in 384-well plates using a Viaflo Assist micro-plate dispenser (Integra Biosciences, Hudson, NH, USA) and allowed to adhere overnight.
 During the primary screening, HMVP2 cells were screened with the individual NCL compounds at 3 time-points (12, 24 or 48 h) and three doses (5, 10, 20 µM final concentration).
 A secondary screen was then performed on both the murine and human cell lines treated for 12 h with combinations of two compounds administered at the same concentration (20 µM final concentration).
 The NCL was dispensed into the seeded 384-well plates using the Viaflo-384 liquid-handling system (Integra Biosciences).
 To reduce bias, the treatments were administered based on a randomized list of well positions.Two bioluminescence assays, CellTiter-Glo kit and ROS-Glo kit (both from Promega, Madison, WI), were used according to the manufacturer’s protocols to measure cell viability and ROS.
 Both ATP and ROS-based measurements were acquired on a SpectraMax M5e Series Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with 4 replicates per condition.
 Relative luminescence values were calculated as the luminescence value of the treated sample over that of solvent control cells within the same plate.In addition, the NMVP and HMVP2 cell lines were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with docetaxel at 1, 10, 25, 50,100 and 250 nM for 12 h. Cell viability was investigated by performing the ATP bioluminescence assay.In vivo tumor growthAll animal husbandry and experiments were carried out in strict accordance to guidelines defined by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and approved by the institutional animal research committees at The University of Texas at Austin.Spheroids generated from HMVP2 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank of male FVB/N mice.
 Thirteen days after injection of spheroids, treatment with the natural compounds was started by switching animals to semipurified AIN76A-based diets containing 1.0% CUR, 0.2% UA, 0.5% RES or their combinations (all ad libitum).
 Body weight and food consumption were monitored weekly in all groups.
 Starting on day 1 of treatment, tumor volume was measured twice weekly using digital calipers.
 Treatment was continued for 32 days and the experiment was terminated 45 days after injection of the tumor cell spheroids.
 At the end of the treatment period, mice were killed, and tumors were excised and weighed.
 The effect on tumor weight and volume was also evaluated following treatment with docetaxel.
 Four days after the injection of spheroids, mice were treated weekly with docetaxel (20 mg/kg body weight with half of the drug volume injected intraperitoneally and half subcutaneously) for four consecutive weeks.
 Tumor volume was measured weekly and tumor weight was measured at the end of the study.HMVP2 cell extracts for metabolomics and isotopic labeling analysisHMVP2 cells were treated for 12 h with either solvent control dimethyl sulfoxide or UA, CUR and RES administered alone or in combination.
 For the glutamine flux analysis, natural abundance glutamine in the medium was completely replaced with 13C5, 15N2-glutamine (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories, Inc.).
 At the end of the 12-h treatment period, an aliquot of media was collected from each flask for extracellular analysis.
 Cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested and intracellular metabolites were extracted using a modified Bligh-Dyer procedure, as previously reported60,61,62,63 (as described in Supplementary Information).MRS-based metabolomics analysisPolar samples for MRS analysis were resuspended in 45 µl of 0.1 M phosphate buffer in 90% D2O with 1 mM TSP, 0.05% NaN3, vortexed and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min.
 Thirty-five microliters of the supernatant were transferred into 1.7-mm tubes.
 One dimensional 1H MRS spectra were acquired and processed as previously described29, 63, 64 (as described in Supplementary Information).MS-based metabolomics analysisBoth polar and lipid analyses were analyzed on a Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Sci., Bremen, Germany).
 Sources for all solvents and reagents, and more detailed experimental procedures are included in Supplementary Information.
 Chromatographic separation was performed on a Thermo Scientific (Thermo Fisher Sci., San José, CA, USA) Accela UHPLC system equipped with a quaternary pump, vacuum degasser and an open autosampler with a temperature controller.
 MS analysis was carried out on a QEx active benchtop Orbitrap detector loading an electrospray (ESI) source simultaneously operating in fast negative/positive polarity switching ionization mode.
 For all sample types (media, and polar and apolar intracellular fractions), quality control samples were run once every five samples.All raw MS datasets were processed using Sieve 2.2 (Thermo Scientific) and mined against an in-house database of accurate masses and retention times generated in our laboratory using the IROA 300, MS Metabolite Library of Standards (IROA Technologies, Bolton, MA).
 In addition, databases of accurate masses taken from the KEGG database65 and the Human Metabolome database66 were also mined.
 Experimental procedures and the specific primary antibodies used are detailed in Supplementary Information.
 For all the Western blots shown, samples were derived from the same experiment and were processed in parallel.
 Molecular weight markers are shown in Supplementary Fig.
 5.Statistical and pathway analyses and evaluation of synergy between natural compoundsFor the screens, Z factor was calculated from ATP values to identify top-hit compounds as previously reported.
 Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the Euclidean distance and average linkage clustering methods on the intracellular levels (normalized to control) of all the identified metabolites.
 The predicted combined affected fraction with values lower than the experimental one is considered synergistic.36  Change history04 September 2017A correction to this article has been published and is linked from the HTML version of this article.References1.Benitez, D.

 Stefano Tiziani and John DiGiovanni from the University of Texas at Austin, and colleagues screened a library of 142 natural compounds for the effects of each molecule, alone or in combination, on the viability of cells from mouse and human prostate cancer cell lines.
 Amongst other promising combinations, the researchers identified ursolic acid and curcumin as the most promising combination for inhibiting tumor growth.
 (These compounds are found naturally in apple peels and turmeric, respectively.)
 In mice with implanted prostate tumors, the two compounds synergistically reduced tumor volume and weight, while in cell culture the researchers showed that the compound-combination strategy modulated metabolism of a critical amino acid and other cell signaling pathways.
