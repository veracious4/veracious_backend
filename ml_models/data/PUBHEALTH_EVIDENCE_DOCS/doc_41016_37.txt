Our Children First ...team hosted a special drive-thru graduation for families.
 We appreciate what our Children First nursing staff do in the home to help first-time mothers and their families prepare for parenthood and parenting their child up to age 2.
 The Children First Team received a special recognition this week from the National office of NFP (known as Children First in Oklahoma).
 Each team member was sent a special lapel pin and honored as a recipient of the NFP 2020 Tenacious Caregiver Award “for going above and beyond the call of duty to continue to serve families during this unprecedented time."
 The Children First team has continued to stay engaged with the families enrolled despite a very limited window of time allotted each week to conduct visits due to their ongoing participation in COVID response activities.
 Congratulations to the Children First Team for this well-deserved recognition!
