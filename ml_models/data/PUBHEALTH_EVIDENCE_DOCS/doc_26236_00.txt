Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Reddit Pinterest  Comments        4    1of4WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 01: U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) (C) leaves the Russell Senate Office Building after being interviewed by CNN about the government response to the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic on Capitol Hill April 01, 2020 in Washington, DC.
 Pelosi told host Anderson Cooper that the federal government needs to give more financial help to state and local governments dealing with COVID-19.
 "We had $150 billion in the bill that the President just signed.
 That is simply not enough, unfortunately," she said.

 Senate Democrats on Thursday stalled President Donald Trump's request for $250 billion to supplement a "paycheck protection" program for businesses crippled by the coronavirus outbreak, demanding protections for minority-owned businesses and money for health care providers and state and local governments.

 But Congress might have to do it soon anyway.
 There is no way for members of Congress to cast votes without being in the Capitol.
 And despite mounting calls, especially from younger lawmakers, for a way to vote remotely, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says any such changes are a long way off.
 “We’re not there yet, and we’re not going to be there no matter how many letters somebody sends in — with all the respect in the world for that,” the San Francisco Democrat told reporters in a call Thursday.
 Pelosi cited a number of concerns, including the security of any technology used, the constitutionality of changes to the rules, the logistics of having members vote on the change, and the time needed to be sure any new system is well thought out and bipartisan.
 The House and Senate have been out of session since March, and they have no plans to return until at least April 20.
 But that date could prove optimistic, as many states and localities have urged people to stay home at least into May.

 Now, Republicans and the White House are pressing for a supplement to that package and another massive recovery bill.
 Pressure is mounting for a way for lawmakers to pass legislation without having to return to Washington, including from several members of the Bay Area delegation.
 Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Dublin, has repeatedly introduced resolutions to allow House members to vote remotely since coming to Congress in 2013.
 As the pandemic spread, he led a request by dozens of Democrats to make a temporary rules change to allow it.
 “My constituents need a voice in Congress right now,” Swalwell said in a statement.
 “It is critical that no matter how this crisis develops, I can continue to advocate for working families in my district — no matter where I am physically.” Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Fremont, also renewed the call Wednesday, tweeting a series of reasons why any argument against remote voting “doesn’t hold up to reality.” “If anyone’s vote is wrong, we’d know immediately, because we almost always know how everyone is voting,” Khanna wrote regarding the safety of technology.
 “Also, we have the security to defend against cyberattacks.
 Congress just needs to partner with tech,” Khanna said.
 “Everyone in Congress is trying to figure out how we do business functionally as a body if we are still looking at significant shelter-in-place restrictions in May,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-San Rafael.
 “Many members just feel very strongly that we shouldn’t physically be in the petri dish of the Capitol right now.” A bipartisan group of centrist lawmakers sent Pelosi and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield a letter on Tuesday reiterating the call, and suggesting options like telephonic voting, videoconferencing and voting machines in members’ district offices or homes.
 House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., released a report on the options.
 It concluded that proxy voting would be the best alternative to in-person voting, in which a lawmaker who was present could register a colleague’s vote.
 But any changes would require amending multiple House rules, the report concluded, and lawmakers would have to be present to vote on those.
 Pelosi said Thursday that the idea “is being pursued,” but that the concerns outlined in McGovern’s report remain unresolved.
 In the meantime, she said, addressing the pandemic takes priority, and Congress’ “best minds” should concentrate on that.
 It’s one area where Pelosi is in agreement with McCarthy.
 He said that he had discussed the matter with Pelosi and that any changes would require lawmakers to be present.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky feels the same way, telling Fox News Radio: “We can work with this pandemic if we have to.” San Jose Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren chairs the House Administration Committee and has been exploring ways in which committees could meet and perhaps vote remotely.
 She said any solution needs to account for the responsibilities of Congress as a public body.
 “I think it’s a mistake, whether it’s voting as a House or as a committee, to focus on technology rather than the principles involved,” Lofgren said.
 “Whether it’s in-person or using components of technology, it’s preserving elements of the democratic system that’s important.” Tal Kopan is The San Francisco Chronicle’s Washington correspondent.
