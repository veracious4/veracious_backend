 (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s proposed payroll tax break met with bipartisan resistance Tuesday on Capitol Hill as pressure mounts on the administration and Congress to work more vigorously to contain the coronavirus outbreak and respond to the financial fallout.Flanked by his economic team, Trump pitched his economic stimulus ideas privately to wary Senate Republicans on another grueling day in the struggle against expanding infections.
 Fluctuating stock markets rebounded but communities discovered new cases and the two top Democratic presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, canceled Tuesday primary night rallies in Ohio.
 ADVERTISEMENTThe president’s GOP allies have been cool to additional spending at this stage, especially for cutting taxes that would have to be reimposed later — presumably after the November election.
 Democrats prefer their own package of low- or no-cost virus testing, unemployment insurance and sick pay for workers struggling to keep paychecks coming as the outbreak disrupts workplaces.“We’re taking this unbelievably seriously,” Trump said after his meeting at the Capitol.
 “It will go away, just stay calm.”Asked why he has not yet been tested for the virus, after having been in close contact with several advisers and members of Congress who are now self-quarantined after exposure, Trump said: “I don’t think it’s a big deal” and “I feel very good.” More on the Virus Outbreak:– Virus locks down Italy amid global push to contain outbreak– What's Happening: Italy under lockdown, officials infected– Spotty sick leave policies limit options for avoiding virusWhite House officials have been blindsided by the president’s sudden moves.
 As Trump headed to Capitol Hill, two administration officials said the proposals he was putting in play had not been completed.
 They were unauthorized to discuss the planning and requested anonymity.
 Trump’s team offered few specifics at the closed door GOP lunch on the size of the payroll tax break or its duration, senators said.
 Trump has long promised to bring about an election year “tax cuts 2.0,” and seemed to be seizing on the virus fears as a way to bring about a victory on that front before November.
 Behind closed doors he discussed the coming elections in swing states like Arizona and Montana where GOP senators face tough races.In addition to payroll tax relief, Trump has said he wants help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they’re “not going to miss a paycheck” and “don’t get penalized for something that’s not their fault.” He’s also mentioned small-business loans.
 But details are slight.ADVERTISEMENTSo far, the president’s approach, based on tax breaks, is receiving a cool response.
 Some Republicans endorsed Trump’s suggestion that help be provided to the beleaguered cruise-ship and airline industries, while others spoke up for other industries, including energy and gas.
 Some pushed for broader economic stimulus from a bipartisan highway bill they said was shovel-ready and popular.
 The payroll tax plan remains a work in progress.“They didn’t get into specifics,” said the No.
 2 Republican, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota.Increasingly, it appears a solution will originate in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats they would keep working this week despite concerns about the risk of infection at the Capitol.“We are the captains of the ship,” Pelosi said during a closed-door meeting, according to a person in the room unauthorized to discuss the private caucus and granted anonymity.
 “We are the last to leave.” But time is short as Congress heads toward its scheduled break next week.Trump tapped Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to meet with Pelosi, whose support will be needed for any deal in the divided Congress, where Republicans hold the Senate majority but Democrats hold the House.
 Munchin declared the meeting with Pelosi “productive” and said they’d “work together on a bipartisan basis to figure out how we can get things done quickly.”Pelosi insisted the “threshold” for any proposal must be its ability to respond to the virus.
 Her team was preparing to come out with a package in the next day or so.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was noncommittal after the meeting with Trump, emphasizing the path forward rests in the talks between Mnuchin and Pelosi.
 “We’re hoping that he and the speaker can pull this together,” he said.That reflected divisions even within the administration on the best approach.
 Other aides, including Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow advocated more modest measures.
 Trump prefers the payroll tax holiday “last through the end of the year,” Kudlow said.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.
 For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.
 The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.
 According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
 In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.In Washington, there were mixed signals about the public mood.
 Tourists still arrived for visits while marquee events, including this weekend’s Gridiron Club dinner, an annual mingling of political Washington, was postponed.
 At the U.S. Capitol, some senators said they resisted shaking Trump’s hand when he arrived for lunch.
 Lawmakers were given new instructions on how to protect themselves, with the House’s attending physician asking them to stop shaking hands or touching people during greetings.
 He recommended the split-fingers Star Trek greeting instead.Crowds are the norm in the Capitol and handshakes are coin of the realm there, even between political foes.
 But about a half dozen lawmakers — including Trump confidantes — have placed themselves in quarantine after being exposed to someone who had the virus, and the norm has been upended.One, GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who self-quarantined after having traveled with the president from Florida on Air Force One on Monday, said he had tested negative for the disease.
 He said he would remain quarantined as a precaution.
 Another, Trump’s incoming chief of staff.
 Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C, remains on quarantine.
 During House Democrats’ closed session, one lawmaker, California Rep. Raul Ruiz, who is a doctor, raised concerns about the situation, noting that the average age in Congress is 57.
 Some lawmakers have underlying health conditions and their work requires them to fly back and forth between home and the capital.Still, Pelosi implored lawmakers to keep working to strengthen the country’s defenses.
 But House and Senate leaders have made it clear there will be no voting by proxy.
 Quarantined lawmakers will be missing votes.
 Lawmakers were told up to 10,000 staff members could telework, if need be.
 The Securities and Exchange Commission, which monitors financial markets, encouraged employees at its Washington headquarters to work from home after an employee there had respiratory symptoms and was referred for coronavirus testing.
 And Defense Secretary Mark Esper postponed a trip to India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan that was to begin Monday, citing the coronavirus crisis, Pentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah said Tuesday.
 She said he would remain in the U.S to help manage the Pentagon response.

 Trump's economic team joined in presenting the economic stimulus package privately to wary Senate Republicans.
 They've been cool to additional spending at this stage.
 Democrats are preparing their own package of low-cost virus testing, unemployment insurance and sick pay for workers struggling to keep paychecks coming as the outbreak disrupts workplaces.

 “I’ve never seen anything like it.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;For most, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.
 But for a few, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illnesses, including pneumonia.
 More than 119,000 people have been infected worldwide and over 4,200 have died.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;By encouraging many of Italy's 62 million people to stay home and further drying up what was left of the country's already battered tourism industry, the lockdown could increase the likelihood of a recession, dealing another blow to reeling global markets.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Italy's economy, the third-largest of the 19 countries that use the euro currency, relies heavily on industries requiring the physical presence and proximity of workers: tourism, manufacturing, and retail.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Italians shouldn’t leave home unless for work, health care or “necessities” such as grocery shopping, the premier's office said.
 Early closures of shops, cafes and restaurants amounted to a seismic restriction in a country that prizes its gastronomy, luxuries and cafe culture.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I’ll do whatever they tell me to do,” Rome florist Stefano Fulvi said.
 “If I have to close, I’ll close.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Italy also found itself increasingly sealed off as other countries sought to keep infections contained.
 British Airways and Air Canada suspended all Italy flights.
 Austria barred travelers from crossing the border without a medical certificate.
 Slovenia closed its border with Italy, and Albania banned Italy air and ferry traffic.
 Britain, Ireland, Hong Kong and Germany strengthened travel advisories and urged their citizens to leave.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In a reversal of positions, China is seeing new cases brought in from overseas.
 In Beijing, the capital, all the new cases of COVID-19 reported on Wednesday came from outside the country, five from Italy and one from the United States.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Improving reports continued to come from South Korea, too, with 242 new cases reported Wednesday, a considerable drop from its highs.
 More than 100 countries — over half of the United Nations' membership — have now confirmed cases.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;France's government advised voters to bring their own pens to local elections Sunday so they won't have to share.
 The United Nations announced the closure of its New York headquarters complex to the general public.
 Albania told its citizens to stay home — banning public gatherings and shuttering schools, entertainment centers, gymnasiums and public pools.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The virus reached into the corridors of power.
 In the United States, several senior politicians were self-quarantined, and in Spain, a leading member of a far-right party tested positive for the virus.
 A British health minister became the first UK lawmaker to be diagnosed with the disease.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;At least two top European military commanders also tested positive after a conference on an American military base in Germany, and the commander of U.S. Army in Europe isolated himself in case he also was exposed.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;New York’s governor announced he is sending the National Guard to scrub public places and deliver food in a New York City suburb that is at the center of the nation's biggest known cluster of infections.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Washington state, where 19 of its 24 deaths have been connected to a Seattle-area nursing home, Gov.
 Jay Inslee announced new rules for screening health care workers and limiting visitors at nursing homes.
 Inslee was planning a news conference for Wednesday morning to announce a ban on gatherings of more than 250 people, a person involved in planning the decision told The Associated Press.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;And in California, thousands of restless passengers stuck on a cruise ship hit by the coronavirus waited their turn to get off the vessel and head to U.S. military bases or their home countries for two weeks of quarantine.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Worldwide, growing numbers of children were being taught online as school closures spread.
 The outbreak has interrupted schooling for nearly 363 million students worldwide, with 15 countries imposing nationwide school closures and 14 implementing localized closures, the U.N.'s education agency said.
 U.S. stocks, oil and other financial markets around the world went on another wild ride Tuesday, clawing back ground after their historic plunge the previous day.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Investors are likely to see more big swings until the number of infections slows down, and fear was still rampant that economies stood at the brink of recession, market watchers said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We are in a global panic,\" said Estelle Brack, an economist in Paris.

 Conte's office said runs on supermarkets went counter to the intent of the new decree, which aims to prevent Italians from congregating.
 Soldiers and police enforced the travel ban and Carabinieri teams patrolled cafes to make sure owners were keeping customers a meter (about three feet) apart.
 It was one of several recent signs of the diminishing threat the coronavirus presents in China as the illness spreads west.
 In mainland China, where the outbreak emerged in December, almost three quarters of the more than 80,000 patients who contracted the virus have recovered.
 Poland's top army commander, Gen. Jaroslaw Mika, was diagnosed after returning from a meeting in Germany.
 Many other officials are in self-isolation after potential exposure, including President Donald Trump's new chief of staff, the German interior minister and the Norwegian defense minister.

 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The vast majority of people recover.
 According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
 That means retail workers like Mendy Hughes must fend for themselves.
 “I don't know what I would be doing about taking care of my family.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hughes, a diabetic and mother of four, gets 48 hours of sick leave a year but she fears it wouldn’t be nearly enough time to recover.
 If they are not able to return to work after that time, additional pay may be provided for up to 26 weeks for both full-time and part-time hourly workers.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the United States, about 27% of private sector workers don’t have access to paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Some countries, like Britain, are looking into helping out non-permanent workers.
 There is no federal sick leave policy in the U.S., but 12 of the 50 states and Washington D.C. require employers to offer paid sick leave.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some House and Senate Democrats have been pushing legislation that would require employers to allow workers to accrue seven days of paid sick leave and to provide an additional 14 days in the event of any public health emergency, including the current coronavirus crisis.
 President Donald Trump said he was seeking help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they’re “not going to miss a paycheck,” and he would outline the proposals Tuesday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Britain, parcel delivery driver Ed Cross worries about catching the virus from the machine he hands people who sign for their packages.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"People have coughed on their hand and then got hold of my machine and you sort of make a joke of it trying to point it out,\" Cross, 53, said.
 “But yeah, it's what we face daily.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"We only have to go to the wrong house and we could catch it, as simple as that,\" said Cross, who on a recent day handed packages to 110 people on his route in Whitby, northern England.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The British government last week made it easier to collect statutory sick pay and is working on changes to help millions of non-permanent workers like Cross who aren't eligible for it.
 In a sign the industry is waking up to the problem, his parcel company, Hermes, announced a 1 million pound ($1.3 million) fund to help couriers who need to self-isolate.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Uber, meanwhile, said it would compensate drivers and couriers for up to 14 days if they get sick or have to be quarantined.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The viral outbreak has revealed gaping holes in health care coverage at a time when people may need it most.
 Most European countries and Canada have universal healthcare systems, but the U.S. relies on a patchwork of public and private insurance.
 U.S. employers with 50 or more employees are required to offer health insurance.
 But the same protection isn't provided to part-time workers or independent contractors.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Waiter Joey Ingham, who works at a barbecue restaurant in Kansas City, Missouri, popular with business travelers, says he doesn't have insurance.
 His protection?
 Washing his hands more often.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If I wasn’t able to come into work, it would be hard to make ends meet,” said Ingham, who waits on 80 to 120 people a shift.
 If he felt sick, he'd “probably talk to a manager” about what to do, but noted management hasn’t yet outlined any policies.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Liss-Riordan said most gig workers — independent or temporary contractors — she represents don't have health insurance.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We won’t have a fully insured population until we get universal healthcare,” he said.
 “There are going to be these huge gaps.
 The burden is falling on the poorest and most vulnerable in our society.
 This is just another example.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends workers without insurance contact a local health department or community health center for help.
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends emergency room visits only for patients who are very sick.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In France, where people have the right not to work and get full pay when they consider their workplaces to be dangerous, some service staff briefly stayed home because of contagion concerns.
 Workers at the Louvre, the world’s most-visited museum, refused to work for two days and were only coaxed back after management introduced a raft of new anti-virus measures.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We are asking for gloves.
 We are asking for disinfectant gels, and masks for the drivers,” said Bastien Berthier, of the Paris metro’s UNSA union.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In China, where the outbreak has been raging for two months, many service industry workers have it far worse, with business evaporating as people are forced to hunker down at home.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A barber in Beijing who would give only his surname, Long, said he is supporting his wife and child by charging food and other expenses to a credit card while he waits for his employer to reopen.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"I can ask for sick leave or compassionate leave, but I get nothing without working,\" said Long, 33.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Jiang Yanlin, a tour guide in eastern China’s Huangshan region, said she hasn’t earned anything since mid-January and doesn’t have any social welfare benefits to fall back on.
 Usually she can earn up 300 yuan ($42) a day during the normally busy Lunar New Year holiday.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If I don't work, I don't get paid.
 Everyone here in the Huangshan tourist zone is like this,” said Jiang, 33.
