 Today the term is often used to describe the developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and Oceania.
 Many poorer nations adopted the term to describe themselves.
 The most repressive regimes in the world.
 List of countries with the worst records for political rights and civil liberties.
 Within these countries and territories, state control over daily life is pervasive and wide-ranging, independent organizations and political opposition are banned or suppressed, and fear of retribution for independent thought and action is part of daily life.
 According to the Freedom House report Freedom in the World 2007, there are eight countries judged to have the worst records:  Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
 Also included are two territories, Chechnya (Russian Federation) and Tibet, whose inhabitants suffer intense repression.
 These states and regions received the Freedom House survey’s lowest rating: 7 for political rights and 7 for civil liberties.
 The report also includes nine more countries near the bottom of Freedom House's list of the most repressive countries:  Belarus, China, Cote d’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Laos, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Zimbabwe.
 The territory of Western Sahara (most of the territory is controlled by Morocco) is also included in this group.
 While these states scored slightly better than the “worst of the worst,” they offer very limited scope for private discussion while severely suppressing opposition political activity, impeding independent organizing, and censoring or punishing criticism of the state.

 Simplified the GNI PPP is the average annual income earned by a citizen of a country.
 That means for example, a citizen of Malawi can spend $ 1.6 a day to make a living,  a citizen of Eritrea $ 2.5, the average US citizen spends $ 114 daily.
 Below countries with an average yearly income per capita and year under $ 1000,  poorest nations first.

 Slightly different figures you will find at The World Bank Group  Full list of National Economic Accounts for Countries and Regions around the World                     Third World Countries in Terms of their Human Development   The Human Development Index (HDI) is published annually by the UN.
 It measures the average achievements in a country in three basic dimensions of human development:   1.
 Life Expectancy Index (LEI): Life expectancy at birth (in years); 2.
 Education Index (EI) Mean years of schooling (in years), and Expected years of schooling (in years), and 3.
 Income Index (II): Per capita income (PPP $).
 Below is the list of countries with a "Low Human Development".
 Definitions: Human Development Index (HDI): A composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development-a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living.
 Life expectancy at birth: Number of years a newborn infant could expect to live if prevailing patterns of age-specific mortality rates at the time of birth stay the same throughout the infant's life.
 Mean years of schooling: Average number of years of education received by people ages 25 and older, converted from education attainment levels using official durations of each level.
 Expected years of schooling: Number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrolment rates persist throughout the child's life.
 Gross national income (GNI) per capita: Aggregate income of an economy generated by its production and its ownership of factors of production, less the incomes paid for the use of factors of production owned by the rest of the world, converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP) rates, divided by midyear population.
 GNI per capita rank minus HDI rank: Difference in rankings by GNI per capita and by the HDI.
 A negative value means that the country is better ranked by GNI than by the HDI.
 Nonincome HDI: Value of the HDI computed from the life expectancy and education indicators only.

 The least developed countries (LDCs) are a group of countries that have been identified by the UN as "least developed".
 United Nations used the following three criteria for the identification of the LDCs  1. a low-income estimate of the gross national income (GNI) per capita.
 2. their weak human assets and   3. their high degree of economic vulnerability.
 There are 50 countries listed in the United Nations comparative analysis of poverty, 34 African countries, 10 Asian countries, 5 Pacific Island Nations and one Caribbean nation.
