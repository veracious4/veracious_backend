 This dual effect may simultaneously protect severely-ill patients and reduce the viral load, therefore limiting virus dissemination We want to demonstrate the superiority of naproxen (anti-inflamatory drug) treatment addition to standard of care compared to standard of care in term of 30-day mortality.
 Condition or disease   Intervention/treatment   Phase     COVID-19   Drug: 1: Naproxen Drug: 2: Standard of care   Phase 3        Detailed Description: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
 (1,2) The exacerbated inflammatory response in COVID-19 infected critically ill patients calls for appropriate anti inflammatory therapeutics combined with antiviral effects.
 Thus, drugs combining anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects may reduce the symptoms of respiratory distress caused by COVID-19.
 This dual effect may simultaneously protect severely ill patients and reduce the viral load, therefore limiting virus dissemination.
 Naproxen, an approved anti-inflammatory drug, is an inhibitor of both cyclo oxygenase (COX-2) and of Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP).
 The NP of Coronavirus (CoV), positive-sense single-stranded viruses, share with negative-sense single-stranded viruses as Influenza the ability to bind to- and protect genomic RNA by forming self-associated oligomers in a helical structure with RNA.
 Naproxen was shown to bind the Influenza A virus NP making electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with conserved residues of the RNA binding groove and C terminal domain.
 (3) Consequently, naproxen binding competed with NP association with viral RNA and impeded the NP self-association process which strongly reduced viral transcription/replication.
 This drug may have the potential to present antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 suggested by modelling work based on the structures of CoV NP.
 The high sequence conservation within the coronavirus family, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the present SARSCoV-2 coronavirus allows to perform this comparison.
 (4) A recent clinical trial shown that the combination of clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir reduced mortality of patients hospitalized for H3N2 Influenza infection.
 (5).
 Inappropriate inflammatory response in CODIV-19 patients was demonstrated in a recent study where Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?
 compared with non-ICU patients.
 (2) We suggest that naproxen could combine a broad-spectrum antiviral activity with its well-known anti inflammatory action that could help reducing severe respiratory mortality associated with COVID-19.
