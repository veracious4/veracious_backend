 While it&apos;s recently begun to gain lots of the accommodations of a bigger city with shopping centers like Century Square and Tower Point, it has maintained the quick and easy commutes, friendly smalltalk, and casual nature of a small town.
 The public high schools are excellent in both academic and athletic departments, and of course with a renowned university right in the backyard, the opportunities for jobs and education are endless.
 Housing is a bit pricey and apart from Hurricane Harry&apos;s and Downtown Bryan, there aren&apos;t many places for entertainment if you&apos;re under 21, but apart from those minor drawbacks, it&apos;s an overall excellent place to live.
 The students are friendly, the equal proximity to Houston, Austin, and Waco are incredibly convenient, and everyone in College Station just seems to be happy to be there.
 It&apos;s no wonder so many Aggie alumni move back to their college town!Current Resident9 months agoOverall ExperienceReportStart Your Review of College StationRate It!My experience at College Station has been pretty good.
 As a student from A&amp;M, I can guarantee that the city provides a multitude of options when it comes to food, jobs, housing, and services.
 It&apos;s everything you could want in a city honestly!
 Companies are built close together so you never only have one single option when it comes to grabbing a bite to eat.
 There are many different produce stores so you wont be limited to a single store.
 Also, the citizens are very kind and welcoming, which is something you don&apos;t see everywhere.
 The police here also patrol a good amount, which increases the safety of the city.
 Overall, it is a very nice city with many opportunities and options for every experience.
 If I could change anything, I would like to see more diversity in the area, but I understand that is out of my control.Current Resident3 months agoOverall ExperienceReportI love the atmosphere in CSTAT!
 Amazing school district, a safe environment, plenty of businesses and many more to come.
 When university is not in session the town is almost like a ghost town.
 The only downside I can think of is that there isn&apos;t too much for families to do in town- besides the movies and many parks to choose from and the cost of living in town has gone up a ton due to so much growth.
 But other than that neighborhoods are nice and the community is accepting- there is quite a bit of diversity in the population which probably has to do with TAMU being in the center.
 The town is in a more central location so day trips to places like Austin, Houston, and Waco are way do-able!Current Resident5 days agoOverall ExperienceReportRead More ReviewsAdd to ListNicheAbout UsNiche For SchoolsNiche For CollegesBlogContact NicheDataCareersPartnershipsPressDo Not Sell My InfoPrivacy PolicyUser AgreementCookie PolicyInstagramFacebookTwitterTiktok©2020 Niche.com Inc.Discover the schools, companies, and neighborhoods that are right for you.K-12CollegesGraduate SchoolsPlaces to LiveDo you work for a school or college?

 Science classes had access to samples from the city's university, and I remember looking at bone, muscle, and skin slides under the microscope.
 There were 9 classes per day and homework was usually due the next day so it was tough.
 I had to draw my own maps for Social Studies and then use that same map on an exam.
 Sex ed was not taught at this school.
 Thomas has been hands down the best decision we have made for our kids.
 Our kids have just blossomed at this school.
 The staff, teachers and head of school are all truly exemplary in their devotion, commitment and love for children.
 We as parents have been shown so much grace.
 This school is exemplary in all that it does.
 The best playground of all the preschools here in BCS.
 Its focus is on \"learning through play\".
 The curriculum is rich, beautiful and child centric.
 The educational philosophy draws from multiple approaches including Reggio Emilia, Waldorf and Montessori.
 Whilst most preschools in town may focus on introducing academics early, this school has its focus on the child and what is truly appropriate for the child's development.
 A truly nurturing, deeply accepting, gentle and respectful environment for children to grow and learn in.

 We support one another and generally there is no drama.
 My general manager is fair and supportive of the employees.
 I am in college now and my manager is flexible with my schedule and allows me to work the days that I need to so that it does not conflict with my college classes.
 I would recommend this location to my friends as a good place to work.
 Recently I went into a different Pei Wei restaurant as a customer and noticed that it was not as well run as my location.
 My manager is very professional with the customers whereas in this other location this manager was not.
 Great environment, kind employees, overall a great atmosphere to be a part of.
