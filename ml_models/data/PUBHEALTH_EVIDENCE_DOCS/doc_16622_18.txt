 Jeffries house appear ready to close a deal that will make the city the latest owner of the historic downtown property.
 City Attorney Joseph Poblick told the council Monday the bank is willing to sell it to the city \"as is\" for $111,000.
 The vote stipulates that a due diligence clause be added to the contract giving the city 45 days to obtain estimates on how much it will cost to repair and restore the house; if the figure is deemed too high, the clause gives the city authority to cancel the sale.
 Options include pulling money out of the general fund reserve account or using revenues from the Penny For Pasco sales tax, Drumm said.

 The home was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.
 The price will be negotiated but is expected to be between $50,000 and $60,000, said Drumm.
 The city will add 145 new customers to its utility roll and should recuperate the money spent on buying the system in about six years, he said.
