Gulf War-era II veterans were relatively young: in 
2009, 18- to 54-year-olds accounted for 95 percent of 
all Gulf War-era II veterans, whereas that same age 
group made up about 7 in 10 nonveterans. Among 
recent veterans, 63 percent of men and 72 percent of 

women were under the age of 35, compared with 37 

percent of nonveteran men and 29 percent of nonvet
-
eran women.
Gulf war-era II veterans were more likely to be 
White (79 percent) than Black (15 percent) or Asian 

(2 percent). Ten percent of these veterans were of His
-panic ethnicity. In contrast, the nonveteran population con
-tained a smaller proportion of Blacks and a larger proportion 

of Hispanics: 12 percent and 15 percent, respectively.
˜ere were noteworthy di˛erences in educational attain
-ment between Gulf War-era II veterans and nonveterans 

in 2009. Gulf War-era II veterans were more likely to have 

some college but no degree (33 percent) than were nonvet
-erans (19 percent). Also, veterans from Gulf War era II were 
much less likely to be high school dropouts (2 percent) than 
were nonveterans (14 percent). About one-fourth of recent 

veterans had a college degree, as did a similar fraction of 

nonveterans.
˜e educational attainment of recent veterans rose sig
-ni˚cantly with age. Older Gulf War-era II veterans had more 
education than younger veterans in 2009. Few Gulf War-era 
II veterans 18 to 24 years had a college degree, because they 

were on active duty during some of these early years of their 

adult lives. In 2009, 31 percent of young veterans 18 to 24 

years were enrolled in school. Older Gulf War-era II veterans 
may have earned their college degrees before joining the mili
-tary or may have ˚nished their degrees while in the military 
or following discharge. A look at the percentages reveals that 

about 19 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds had a college degree, 

compared with 35 percent of 35- to 44-year-olds and 38 per
-cent of 45- to 54-year-olds.
Labor force
Almost 84 percent of Gulf War-era II veterans 18 years 

and older participated in the labor force sometime in 2009, 

compared with 68.3 percent of nonveterans.
6 Much of this 
di˛erence has to do with the fact that Gulf War-era II vet
-erans tend to be younger than nonveterans. People 18 to 54 
years typically have higher labor force participation rates than 
those 55 years and older. In 2009, Gulf War-era II veterans 

18 to 54 years had a labor force participation rate of 84.1 per
-cent, while those 55 years and older had a participation rate 

of 72.0 percent. Since almost all Gulf War-era II veterans in 

the labor force (96 percent) were 18 to 54 years, the discus
-sion that follows will focus on this group of veterans and their 

nonveteran counterparts, except where otherwise noted.
The employed
In 2009, 1.4 million recent veterans (1.2 million men and 

more than 200,000 women) 18 to 54 years were employed. 

Men were nearly 85 percent of employed veterans and 
about half of nonveterans. ˜e following tabulation of the 
employment-population ratio (the employed as a percent of 

the population) of those 18 to 54 years shows that a greater

larger proportion of men in the veteran population, given 

that men tend to be employed at greater rates than women.
Since the start of the recession in 2007 and through 2009, 
the employment-population ratio declined for both Gulf 

War-era II veterans and nonveterans. However, the decline 

was greatest among veterans, especially male veterans.
˜e following tabulation of the occupational distri
-bution (occupation as a percent of total employed) of 
employed persons 18 to 54 years, by veteran status, oc
-cupation, and sex in 2009, shows that there was little dif
-ference in occupational distribution between veterans and 
nonveterans of the same sex:

 ........... 17  4  17    5One major exception was in service occupations: male 
veterans (10 percent) were more than 3 times as likely to 

be employed in protective service occupations than were 
male nonveterans (3 percent).
7Another major di˛erence was that Gulf War-era II 
veterans were almost twice as likely to be government 
workers as were nonveterans of comparable ages (18 to 
54 years). Among employed veterans in this group, 26 
percent worked in the government at the Federal, State, 

or local level in 2009, compared with 14 percent of non
-
veterans. About one-third of female veterans worked in 

government in 2009, as did 25 percent of male veterans. 

For nonveterans, the proportions were 18 percent and 11 
percent, respectively. ˜ree percent of Gulf War-era II 
veterans were self-employed, compared with 6 percent of 

nonveterans.
8Unemployment rate
One measure of how a population is faring in the labor 

market is the unemployment rate, which is the propor
-tion of the labor force that is currently not working but 
is actively seeking a job and is available to take one. In 
2009, the unemployment rate for Gulf War-era II veter
-ans between the ages of 18 and 54 years was 10.3 percent, 

only slightly di˛erent from the rate for nonveterans in the 

same age group (9.6 percent).
As the following tabulation of the unemployed as a 
percent of the labor force shows, unemployment rates of 

both Gulf War-era II veterans and nonveterans have risen 

since the start of the recession in 2007, re˝ecting the de
-teriorating economic conditions:

 2007 2008 2009 2007-09Gulf War-era II veterans:
  Total.
 .............................  6.1 7.5 10.3 4.2    Men ............................ 5.6 7.2 10.1 4.5    Women

 ....................... 4.5  5.5  8.3 3.8From 2007 to 2009, unemployment rates for men rose 
more than for women, regardless of veteran status.
As with other measures, the slight di˛erence in total 
unemployment rates of Gulf War-era II veterans and 

nonveterans can be partially explained by the di˛er
-ent demographic compositions of the two groups. Men 

were a large majority (82 percent) of all Gulf War-era II 

veterans ages 18 to 54 years, but made up about half (48 

percent) of all nonveterans. In 2009, the unemployment 
rate of all men ages 18 to 54 years (10.9 percent) was 
higher than that of all women in the same age group (8.3 
 

percent; the rates were the same as those for nonveteran 
men and women, respectively). ˜e higher proportion of 

men among the veteran population partially explains the 
overall higher unemployment rate for veterans compared 
with nonveterans. Furthermore, Gulf War-era II veterans 

were younger than nonveterans, on average, and many 

Gulf War-era II veterans were in younger age ranges (see 

table 1) with higher unemployment rates.
9 EarningsEarnings are another measure of success in the labor 

market.
10 As with the analysis of labor force activity, the 
earnings data presented are for individuals 18 to 54 years. 

However, the analysis is limited to men, because there 
were not enough female Gulf War-era II veterans in 2009 
to analyze the earnings data for that group.
Among full-time workers, there was little di˛erence be
-tween the median weekly earnings of male Gulf War-era II 

veterans and nonveterans in 2009. Recent veterans earned 

$796 per week, compared with $786 for nonveterans.
11
In 2009, men working full time in government jobs 
earned more than their counterparts in the private sector, 

regardless of veteran status. (See chart 1.) Male Gulf War-
era II veterans employed in government earned $866 per 

week, while those employed in the private sector earned 
$760. Among nonveteran men, those working in govern
-ment earned $927 per week, compared with $765 per week 
for those employed in the private sector. It is important to 

note that individuals™ earnings are in˝uenced by a variety 

of factors, such as educational attainment, age, occupation, 
industry, ˚rm size, geographic location, and job tenure.
Special categories of veterans 
Additional information about veterans is available from 
the CPS through a supplemental survey that is cospon
-sored by the U.S. Department of Veterans A˛airs and the 

U.S. Department of Labor™s Veterans™ Employment and 
Training Service. ˜is survey has been conducted every 
other year since 1985, and the most recent data are from 

August 2009.
12 ˜e supplement contains questions about 
service-connected disabilities and Reserve or National 

Guard status.
Data from the 
CPS veterans supplement show that, in 
August 2009, 71.0 percent of disabled veterans ages 18 

years and older who served in Gulf War era II were em
-ployed, compared with 76.1 percent of veterans from that 
  Chart 1.

N






 
era who did not have any disability.
13 About 3 of 10 veter
-ans ages 18 years and older held a job with Federal, State, 
or local government, regardless of their disability status.
14˜e August 2009 supplement also collected informa
-tion about Gulf War-era II veterans™ membership in the 

Reserve or National Guard. About 34 percent of these 
veterans ages 18 years and older indicated that they 
were current or past members. ˜is group had an unem
-ployment rate of 10.6 percent. ˜e 46 percent of Gulf 

War-era II veterans ages 18 years and older who never 

participated in the Reserve or National Guard had an 

unemployment rate of 13.8 percent. (About 20 percent 
of recent veterans did not report their Reserve or Na
-tional Guard status.) ˜e lower unemployment rate for 
recent veterans who are current or past members of the 

Reserve or National Guard may be in˝uenced by the fact 

that some returned to the same job they held before go
-ing on active duty.
15
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE INTEREST
 in demographic 
and employment characteristics of recent veterans and in 

how veterans are faring in the current labor market. De
-mographic and labor market data from the 
CPS provide 
useful information about this group. In using these data, 

it is best to compare veterans and nonveterans of the same 
age and sex groups, because of di˛erences in demographic 
characteristics of the Gulf War-era II veteran and nonvet
-eran populations.
Gulf War-era II veterans are more likely than nonvet
-erans to be men and to be between the ages of 18 and 54 
years. ˜e 2009 
CPS data show that the unemployment 
rates of recent male veterans and male nonveterans ages 

18 to 54 years were about the same. However, the unem
-ployment rate of recent female veterans was higher than 

that of female nonveterans in 2009. Male veterans and 

nonveterans were equally likely to be employed, as were 

female veterans and nonveterans.
˜ere was little di˛erence in the earnings of male Gulf 
War-era II veterans and nonveterans in 2009. Among 
wage and salary workers, men had higher earnings if they 
worked in the public sector than in the private sector, re
-gardless of their veteran status. However, male veterans 

working in government had somewhat lower earnings 

than did male nonveterans in 2009.
As of August 2009, 71.0 percent of Gulf War-era II 
veterans with a service-connected disability held a job; 

about 3 of 10 of these disabled veterans worked for the 

government. Current or past members of the Reserve or 

National Guard who served on active duty sometime since 

September 2001 had an unemployment rate of 10.6 per
-cent, compared with 13.8 percent for those veterans who 

never participated in the Reserve or National Guard.
Notes
1 Gulf War era II began in September 2001 and continues through 
the present. ˜e designation ﬁGulf War era IIﬂ was developed in con
-sultation with the Department of Veterans A˛airs and the Depart

see the section entitled ﬁ
CPS questions that determine veteran statusﬂ 
in the appendix.5 All references to the U.S. population in this article are to the ci
-vilian noninstitutional population. ˜erefore, active-duty members of 
the military, as well as individuals residing in places such as prisons, 

hospitals, and mental institutions, are excluded.
6 ˜e labor force participation rate measures the proportion of 
the civilian noninstitutional population that is either employed or 

unemployed.
7 Protective service, a subset of service occupations, includes, among 
others, police and sheri˛s™ patrol o˙cers; security guards and gaming 

surveillance o˙cers; and baili˛s, correctional o˙cers, and jailers.
8 In this article, the term ﬁself-employedﬂ refers to the unincorpo
-rated self-employed. Incorporated self-employed veterans are consid
-ered wage and salary workers.
9 In 2009, 161,000 recent veterans ages 18 to 54 years were unem
-ployed, of whom 31 percent were ages 18 to 24 years and more than 50 

percent were ages 25 to 34 years. ˜e unemployment rate for those ages 

18 to 24 years was 21.1 percent, while the rate for those ages 25 to 34 

years was 10.6 percent. Among unemployed nonveterans ages 18 to 54 
years, 25 percent were ages 18 to 24 years and 28 percent were ages 25 
to 34 years. ˜e unemployment rates for these nonveteran groups were 

16.6 percent and 9.8 percent, respectively.
10 Earnings data from the 
CPS are collected from one-quarter of 
the CPS monthly sample. In other words, each month, individuals liv
-ing in households that have been in the survey for either 4 or 8 months 

are asked about earnings on their primary job. ˜ese month-in-sample 

groups are sometimes referred to as 
outgoing rotation groups
, and earn
-ings are tabulated for wage and salary workers only. ˜us, earnings data 
exclude both the incorporated and unincorporated self-employed, as 
well as unpaid family workers. ˜e earnings data presented here are for 

workers on their full-time jobs (at least 35 hours per week).
11 ˜e di˛erence in their earnings is not statistically signi˚cant.

 ˜e CPS was designed to produce timely monthly estimates 
of employment and unemployment at the national level. ˜e 
survey was established in 1940, just before the United States 

entered World War II. After the war ended, the
 CPS
 provided 
data on the postservice adjustment of male veterans into the 

civilian labor force in the 1940s and 1950s.
1 Similarly, during 
the Vietnam era, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published quar
-terly 
CPS data about male veterans of that era, beginning with 
data from the ˚rst quarter of 1969.
2 Later, the Bureau published 
these Vietnam-era data monthly. 
CPS data about female veterans 
were ˚rst collected and became available as of January 1986, 

re˝ecting the growing number of women who had served in the 

military.
3 Following renewed military action in the Persian Gulf 
area and troop deployment in Afghanistan and Iraq, in 2006 the 

Bureau began publishing labor force statistics for veterans of 

the Gulf War era, which includes Gulf War era I (August 1990 

through August 2001) and Gulf War era II (September 2001 

to the present).
4CPS questions identifying veteran status
In the 
CPS, veteran status is obtained from responses to two 
questions. ˜e ˚rst is ﬁDid you ever serve on active duty in the 

U.S. Armed Forces?ﬂ If the response is ﬁyes,ﬂ the person is asked, 

ﬁAre you still in the Armed Forces?ﬂ Answers of ﬁyesﬂ to the ˚rst 

question and ﬁnoﬂ to the second question identify the individual 

as a veteran. Veterans are not on active duty at the time of the 

survey.
In the
 CPS
, the following individuals are considered as hav
-ing served on active duty:
Members of the U.S Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Ma
-rine Corps, or Navy. 
Members of the Reserve or National Guard whose unit 

was called to active duty 
by Presidential order
. 
U.S. o˙cers commissioned by the Public Health Service 

and assigned to any branch of the Armed Services.
Cadets in a U.S. military academy (Air Force Academy, 

Coast Guard Academy, Naval Academy, or West Point).
˜ese individuals do not qualify as having served on active duty:
Members of the National Guard or Reserve serving only 

for training.
Members of the National Guard or Reserve called into 

action 
without a
 Presidential order
 for help in a local dis-
aster such as a ˝ood, tornado, or riot.
Civilian employees of the Department of Defense, Mer
-chant Marine, or Maritime Commission.
CPS question identifying period of service
˜e question ﬁWhen did you serve on active duty in the U.S. 

Armed Forces?ﬂ asked only of veterans, is used to identify the 

following periods of service:
 Period
 Timeframe
 Gulf War era II
 September 2001Œpresent
 Gulf War era I
 August 1990ŒAugust 2001
 Vietnam era 
 August 1964ŒApril 1975
 Korean War
  July 1950ŒJanuary 1955
 World War II
 December 1941ŒDecember 1946   Other
 All other periods
Period-of-service de˚nitions are modi˚ed occasionally to re
-
˝ect changes in laws, regulations, and program needs of the 

survey sponsors.
In data tabulated by the Bureau, veterans who served during 
one of the selected wartime periods and during another period 

are classi˚ed into the wartime period. For instance, a veteran 

who served on active duty from 1968 through 1988 would be 

considered a Vietnam-era veteran. However, in the microdata, 

both periods of service would be identi˚ed (Vietnam era and 

other periods of service).
5A veteran who served in more than one wartime period is 
classi˚ed into the most recent one. For example, a veteran who 

served on active duty from 2000 through 2005 would be con
-sidered a Gulf War-era II veteran, and in the microdata both 

periods of service would be identi˚ed (Gulf War era I and Gulf 

War era II).
APPENDIX: Technical information about 
CPS data on veterans
 
Tabulated annual average and monthly data
 Since April 2008, the Bureau has published annual average la
-bor force statistics on veterans and nonveterans in a news release 
entitled ﬁEmployment Situation of Veterans.ﬂ
6 Previously, these 
annual averages appeared only in unpublished tables available 

to the public upon request. Monthly data by veteran status were 

added to the ﬁEmployment Situation,ﬂ the monthly 
BLS
 news 
release about employment and unemployment, on February 5, 

2010.
7 Limitations of the 
CPS data
 ˜e sample size of the 
CPS limits the precision of detailed data 
pertaining to relatively small groups. For instance, during any 

month in 2009, approximately 11,000 veterans were members 

of a household participating in the 
CPS. Of those 11,000, about 
700 had served during Gulf War era II. Further dividing the 

data by sex and age results in weighted estimates that are based 

on very few interviews. As a result, the standard errors for some 

weighted estimates are large.
Weighting procedures for data on veterans 
˜e publication entitled 
Design and Methodology: Current Popula
-tion Survey
, also known as Technical Paper 66, describes weight
-ing procedures for calculating various kinds of data on veterans.
8Frequency of the 
CPS veterans supplement
Periodically, a set of questions about a particular subjectŠ
also known as a 
CPS
 supplementŠis added to the end of the 
basic 
CPS
 interview. ˜e
 CPS
 ˚rst added a supplement about 
veterans, including questions asking them about whether 

they had a service-connected disability, in April 1985. ˜is 

supplement has continued to be part of the 
CPS
 during one 
month every other year from 1985 through 2009. Beginning 

in 2009, the supplement will be conducted annually. In 2010, 

the supplement will be asked in July. Beginning in August 

2011, the supplemental questions will be asked in August of 

each year.
ﬁEmployment Situation of Veteransﬂ 
˜e results of the 
CPS veterans supplement are published in the 
news release ﬁEmployment Situation of Veterans,ﬂ usually in 

March or April in the year following the survey. A small change 

to this practice occurred on April 10, 2008, when the Bureau 

published supplement data collected in August 2007 along with 

2007 annual average data from the 
CPS. ˜is was the ˚rst news 
release to include annual average data by veteran status. ˜e 

next year, on March 20, 2009, the Bureau published only 2008 

annual average data by veteran status, because supplemental 

questions about veterans were not asked in 2008; at that point, 

the supplement was biennial. On March 12, 2010, the Bureau 

published August 2009 supplemental data and 2009 annual 

averages. In early 2011, 
BLS will release July 2010 supplement 
data and 2010 annual averages. Beginning in August 2011, the 

supplemental questions will be asked in August of each year 

and the supplement data will be published the year after their 

collection, along with annual average data.
