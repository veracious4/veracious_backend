 Leaders across Amazon are meeting every day to consider the evolving situation and are consulting with medical experts to ensure we are doing all we can to keep our teams healthy.
 We’ve taken a number of actions over the past few weeks and today we’re introducing two more.Extra time off with pay for full and part-time employeesEffective immediately, all Amazon employees diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine will receive up to two-weeks of pay.
 This additional pay while away from work is to ensure employees have the time they need to return to good health without the worry of lost pay.
 This is in addition to unlimited unpaid time off for all hourly employees through the end of April.Amazon Relief FundWe are establishing the Amazon Relief Fund with a $25 million initial contribution focused on supporting our independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants, and seasonal employees under financial distress during this challenging time.
 We will be offering all of these groups the ability to apply for grants approximately equal to up to two-weeks of pay if diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine by the government or Amazon.Additionally, this fund will support our employees and contractors around the world who face financial hardships from other qualifying events, such as a natural disaster, federally declared emergency, or unforeseen personal hardship.
 Applicants can apply and receive a personal grant from the fund ranging from $400 to $5,000 USD per person.We will be publishing a website in the coming days where employees and contractors can apply for grants from the fund.I’ve never been more proud of our teams around the world.
 People are supporting one another, taking care of themselves and others while also doing what we do best, which is serving customers.
