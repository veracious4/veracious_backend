 As CNN reported after the bill passed:Five Republican lawmakers — Republican Sen. Ted Cruz along with Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Doug Collins of Georgia, Paul Gosar of Arizona and Mark Meadows of North Carolina — opted to self-quarantine after interacting with an individual at the Conservative Political Action Conference who has tested positive for coronavirus.

 Three Democratic Party congressmembers — Don Beyer of Virginia, California’s Julia Brownley, and John Yarmuth of Kentucky — also announced that they were imposing a self-quarantine or working remotely.
