awareness about the seriousness of 

the obesity epidemic, encouraged 

the creation of a national obesity-
prevention strategy, and highlighted 

promising approaches for reversing the 

epidemic at the state and local level.After decades of bad news, we™re ˜nally seeing signs of progress.  In 
August 2013, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) 
announced that rates of obesity 
among preschool children from 
low-income families decreased in 18 
states and one U.S. territory. That™s 
after a handful of states as diverse 
as California and Mississippi already 
had reported progress in reducing 
rates of childhood obesity. We™ve 
also seen declines in New York City, 
Anchorage, Philadelphia and other 
cities that were among the ˜rst to 
adopt a comprehensive approach to 
preventing obesity among children. And, in this year™s F as in Fat, we 

can report that adult obesity rates 

remained level in almost every state. 

That™s after three decades of increases.The rates, however, remain very high, 
putting Americans at risk for a range 

of health problems and adding a major 

burden to national healthcare costs. 
Currently, 13 states have adult obesity 
rates topping 30 percent, 41 states have 

rates above 25 percent, and every state 

is above 20 percent. It™s hard to believe 

thatŠjust 30 years agoŠthe highest 

adult obesity rate for any state was still 

lower than the lowest obesity rates today.  
Even with an apparent stabilization of 
adult rates and the ˜rst signs of decreases 

in childhood obesity rates, progress is 

uneven. For instance, in most places 

where rates of childhood obesity have 

declined, children living in lower-income 

communities and communities of color 

are experiencing slower reductions in 
INTRODUCTIONﬁFﬂ as in ﬁForward?ﬂThe following is a letter from Risa 
Lavizzo-Mourey, MD, MBA, president 
and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson 
Foundation (RWJF), and Jeffrey Levi, 
PhD, executive director of the Trust 
for America™s Health (TFAH).If we fail to reverse our nation™s obesity epidemic, the current generation of young people may be the ˜rst in 
American history to live sicker and die younger than their 
parents™ generation. That™s a frightening prospect and an unacceptable outcome. It™s the reason our organizations collaborate to produce this annual report.  4obesity or no progress at all. Philadelphia 
provides a notable exception: in addition 

to overall progress, the city reports reduc-
tions in obesity-related disparities. 
So where does this leave us? In talking 
about this year™s report, we considered 

renaming it F as in Forward because we 

honestly believe real and lasting progress 

is being made in the nation™s effort to 
turn back the obesity epidemic. We know 

what is working to make that progress. 

Our success among children has taught 

our nation how to prevent obesity: chang-
ing public policies, community environ-
ments, and industry practices in ways that 

support and promote healthy eating and 

physical activity. When schools, parents, 

policymakers and industry leaders get 

together, they can create a culture of 

health that improves children™s lives.But no one should believe that the nation™s work is done.Our challenge is to ensure that everyone shares in the bene˜ts 
of what we are learning and the 
progress we are making. We must 
build a movement around a truly 
comprehensive approach to making 
our nation healthier, citizen by 
citizen, town by town, state by state. As you™ll see in this year™s report, we 
highlight speci˜c features of that ap-
proach. For instance, all food in schools 

must be healthy, kids and adults should 

have access to more opportunities to be 

physically active on a regular basis, res-
taurants should post calorie information 

on menus, food and beverage compa-
nies should market only their healthiest 

products to children, our nation should 

invest more in preventing disease to 

save money on treating it, America™s 

transportation plans should encourage 

biking and walking, and everyone should 

be able to purchase healthy, affordable 

foods close to home. 
The good news is that we know what to do. The only question is, do we 
have the will to do it?F AS IN FAT 2013 MAJOR FINDINGSAdult Obesity Trends in the United States (based on latest available data): 
  Thirteen states currently have an adult obesity rate above 30 percent, 41 states 
have rates of at least 25 percent, and every state has a rate above 20 percent.
  Obesity rates remained level in every state except for an increase in Arkansas.  

Previously, the United States had experienced three decades of increases:  in 
1980, no state was above 15 percent; in 1991, no state was above 20 percent; 
in 2000, no state was above 24 percent; and in 2007, only Mississippi was above 

30 percent.  Since 2005, there has been some evidence the rates have not been 
climbing as rapidly.  In 2005, every state but one increased; in 2008, 37 states 
increased; in 2010, 28 states increased; in 2011, 16 states increased.*  Of the states with the 20 highest adult obesity rates, only Pennsylvania is not 

in the South or Midwest. For the ˜rst time in eight years, Mississippi no longer 
has the highest rateŠLouisiana at 34.7 percent is the highest, followed closely 
by Mississippi at 34.6 percent. Colorado had the lowest rate at 20.5 percent.  Rates vary by age.  Obesity rates for Baby Boomers (45- to 64-year-olds) have 

reached 40 percent in two states (Alabama and Louisiana) and are 30 percent 
or higher in 41 states.  By comparison, obesity rates for seniors (65+-year-olds) 
exceed 30 percent in only one state (Louisiana). Obesity rates for young adults 

(18- to 25-year-olds) are below 28 percent in every state.  Obesity rates vary by education.  More than 35 percent of adults (ages 26 and 

above) who did not graduate high school are obese, compared with 21.3 percent 
of those who graduated from college or technical college.  Obesity rates vary by income.  More than 31 percent of adults (ages 18 and 
above) who earn less than $25,000 per year were obese, compared with 25.4 
percent of those who earn at least $50,000 per year.  Nine of the 10 states with the highest rates of type 2 diabetes and hypertension 
are in the South.*Note: CDC changed the methodology for measuring obesity rates in states in 2012.More than two-thirds  
(68.7 percent) of American adults are either overweight  or obese. F as in Fat: Key FindingsSECTION 1: OBESITY RATES AND RELATED TRENDS AUGUST 2013Obesity Rates and  Related TrendsADULT OBESITY RATES RISING OVER TIME:  More than two-thirds (68.7 percent) of 
American adults are either overweight 

or obese.1  In the past 30 years, adult 
obesity rates have more than doubled 

Š from 15 percent in 1976Œ1980 

to 35.7 percent in 2009Œ2010.  The 

average American adult is more than 

24 pounds heavier today than in 1960.2Gender Gap Closing:  Ten years 
ago, the obesity rate for women was 
signi˜cantly higher than the rate for 
men Š 33.4 percent compared with 
27.5 percent.3  Currently, men™s (35.8 percent) and women™s (35.5 percent) 
obesity rates are essentially the same.4  RACIAL/ETHNIC GAP EXISTS AMONG WOMEN:Prevalence of Obesity Among Women Ages 20 and Older by Race and 
Ethnicity: 1988 to 1994 and 2009 to 2010 Obesity rates for men are relatively 
similar among different racial/ethnic 

groups: 36.2 percent among White 

men; 38.8 percent among Black men; 

and 36.6 percent among Mexican-American men.  However, women™s 

rates vary signi˜cantly: 32.2 percent 

among White women; 58.5 percent 

among Black women; and 44.9 percent 

among Mexican-American women.5Obesity in

Researchers at the Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention (CDC) report 

that rates of childhood obesity have 

remained statistically the same for the 

past 10 years, with the exception of 

the prevalence of obesity among boys 

(2 to 19 years old) increased from 14 

percent in 1999 to 2000 to 18.6 per-
cent in 2009-2010.6  However, rates of 
obesity among children ages 2 to 19 
are still far too highŠmore than triple 

what they were in 1980.7  According 
to the most recent National Health 

and Nutrition Examination Survey 

(NHANES), 16.9 percent of children 

ages 2 to 19 are obese, and 31.7 per-
cent are overweight or obese.8  This 
translates to more than 12 million chil-
dren and adolescents who are obese 

and more than 23 million who are 

either obese or overweight.  
Extreme Obesity Rates Rising Among 

Adults and Children:  The number of 
extremely obese adults and children 

also has grown signi˜cantly over time.  

The rate of extremely obese adults 

grew from 1.4 percent from 1976Œ1980 

to 6.3 percent during 2009Œ2010.9  An 
individual is considered extremely 

obese if his or her body mass index 

(BMI) is greater than or equal to 40, 

which is roughly the equivalent of 

being 100 pounds or more above ideal 
body weight. The number of extremely 

obese women is nearly twice that of 

men (8.1 percent versus 4.4 percent).  

For children and teens ages 2 to 19, 

severe obesity grew from 1.1 percent 

among boys and 1.3 percent among 

girls during 1976 to 1980 to 5.1 percent 

among boys and 4.7 percent among 

girls during 1999 to 2006.10, 11  Rates 
were particularly high among Hispanic 

boys (9 percent) and non-Hispanic 

Black girls (12.6 percent).

adult obesity rates increased in one state and stayed level 

in the remaining states.  Thirteen states currently have an 

adult obesity rate over 30 percent.  Louisiana now has the 

highest rate of obesity at 34.7 percent, followed closely by 
Mississippi at 34.6 percent, while Colorado had the lowest 
rate at 20.5 percent.  Of the states with the 20 highest 

adult obesity rates, only Pennsylvania is not in the South 

or Midwest.  Northeastern and Western states comprise 

most of the states with the lowest rates of obesity.The U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) set a 

goal to reduce the adult obesity rate 

from 33.9 percent to 30.5 percent by 

2020, which would be a 10 percent 
decrease.12  Healthy People 2020 
also set a goal of increasing the 

percentage of people at a healthy 

weight from 30.8 percent to 33.9 

percent by 2020.

Fat compares data from the Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).BRFSS is the largest ongoing telephone 
health survey in the world. It is a 

state-based system of health surveys 
established by CDC in 1984.  BRFSS 
completes more than 400,000 adult 

interviews each year.  For most 
states, BRFSS is the only source of 
population-based health behavior data 

about chronic disease prevalence and 
behavioral risk factors.   
BRFSS surveys a sample of adults in each state to get information on health 
risks and behaviors, health practices for preventing disease, and healthcare access linked mostly to chronic disease 
and injury. The sample is representative of the population of each state.Washington, D.C., is included in the rankings because CDC provides funds 
to the city to conduct a survey in an equivalent way to the states.The data are based on telephone surveys 
by state health departments, with assis-
tance from the CDC.  Surveys ask people 
to report their weight and height, which is 
used to calculate body mass index.  Experts 

say rates of overweight and obesity are 
probably slightly higher than shown by the 
data because people tend to underreport 

their weight and exaggerate their height.14BRFSS made two changes in methodology 
for its dataset starting in 2011 to make the data more representative of the total population. The changes included making survey calls to cell-phone numbers and 
adopting a new weighting method:  The ˜rst change is including and then growing the number of interview calls made to cell phone numbers. Estimates today are that three in 10 U.S. house-
holds have only cell phones.   The second is a statistical measurement change, which involves the way the data are weighted to better match the demo-graphics of the population in the state.  
The new methodology means the BRFSS 
data will better represent lower-income and racial and ethnic minorities, as well as populations with lower levels of formal 
education. Although generalizing is dif˜cult because of these variables, it is likely that the changes in methods will result 
in somewhat higher estimates for the occurrence of behaviors that are more common among younger adults and to 
certain racial and ethnic groups.The change in methodology makes direct comparisons to data collected prior to 2011 dif˜cult.  In prior years, this report has included racial, ethnic and gender breakdowns by state. However, because there is only one year of data available using the new meth-
odology, the sample sizes for some states are too small to reliably provide these breakdowns in this year™s report.More information on the methodology is available in Appendix B. 14DEFINITIONS OF OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHTObesity is de˜ned as an excessively high 
amount of body fat or adipose tissue in 
relation to lean body mass.15,16  Overweight 
refers to increased body weight in relation 

to height, which is then compared to a 
standard of acceptable weight.17  Body 
mass index, or BMI, is a common measure 
expressing the relationship (or ratio) of 
weight to height.  The equation is:  
Adults with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 are considered overweight, while individuals with a BMI of 30 or more are considered obese.  The National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) adopted a lower optimal weight threshold in June 1998.  Previously, the federal government de˜ned overweight as 
a BMI of 28 for men and 27 for women.On the basis of CDC growth charts from 2000, children and youth at or above the 95th percentile were de˜ned as 
ﬁoverweight,ﬂ while children at or above the 85th percentile but below the 95th 
percentile were de˜ned as ﬁat risk of overweight.ﬂ  However, in 2007, an expert committee recommended using the same 
cut points but changing the terminology by replacing ﬁoverweightﬂ with ﬁobeseﬂ and ﬁat risk of overweightﬂ with ﬁoverweight.ﬂ  The committee also added an additional cut point Š BMI at or above the 99th per-centile Š to de˜ne ﬁsevere obesity.ﬂ18BMI is considered an important measure for understanding population trends.  For individuals, it is one of many factors that should be considered in evaluating healthy 
weight, along with waist size, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, cholesterol level and blood sugar.19An analysis of the 2012 BRFSS data looking at income, level 

of schooling completed and obesity ˜nds strong correlations 
between obesity and income,  and between 
 obesity and education:  Over 35 percent of adults age 26 and older who did not graduate 
high school were obese, compared with 22.1 percent of those who 
graduated from college or technical college.  Thirty-three percent of adults who earn less than $15,000 per 
year were obese, compared with 25.4 percent of those who

income families, found that 14.4 percent of this group is 

obese, compared with 12.1 percent of all U.S. children 
of a similar age.21 The data for PedNSS is based on 
actual measurements rather than self-reported data. The 
prevalence of obesity among children from low-income 

families increased from 12.7 percent in 1999 to 14.4 
percent in 2011.  However, during 2008 to 2011, 18 states 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands had a statistically signi˜cant

STUDY OF CHILDREN AGES 10 TO 17 (2011)The most recent data for childhood statistics on a state-by-state level are from the 2011 National Survey of Children™s 

Health (NSCH).23  According to the study, obesity rates 
for children ages 10 to 17, de˜ned as BMI greater than the 

95th percentile for age group, ranged from a low of 9.9 

percent in Oregon to a high of 21.7 percent in Mississippi.  
Seven of the 10 states with the highest 
rates of obese children are in the 

South.  Only two states had statistically 

signi˜cant changes for rates of obese 

children between the 2007 to 2011 

surveys: South Carolina saw an increase 

and New Jersey saw a decrease.The NSCH study is based on a survey 

of parents in each state.  The data are 

derived from parental reports, so they 

are not as reliable as measured data, 

such as NHANES and PedNSS, but 

they are the only source of comparative 

state-by-state data for children.

STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS (2011)The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) includes both national and state 
surveys that provide data on adolescent obesity and overweight rates, most recently in 
2011.24 The information from YRBSS is self-reported.There was an increase from 1999 to 2011 
in the prevalence of students nationwide 

who were obese (10.6 percent to 

13 percent) and overweight (14.2 

percent to 15.2 percent).26  Students 
also reported on whether or not they 

participated in at least 60 minutes of 

physical activity every day of the week.  

The most recent state surveys, conducted 

in 43 states, found a wide range in the 

percentage of high school students 

who were physically active for at least 60 

minutes per day seven days a week, from 
a high of 33.1 percent in Oklahoma to 

a low of 20.8 percent in Utah, with a 

median prevalence of 25.8 percent.The latest state surveys also found a range 
of obesity levels: a low of 7.3 percent in 

Colorado to a high of 17.0 percent in 

Alabama, with a median prevalence of 

12.0 percent.  Overweight prevalence 

among high school students ranged from 

a low of 10.7 percent in Colorado to a 

high of 19.5 percent in Louisiana, with a 

median prevalence of 14.7 percent.

ADULT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE 
CONSUMPTION, 201127Nationally, 37.7 percent of adults consume fruits less than one time a day, and 22.6 consume vegetables less than 
one time a day.  Consumption of fruits ranged from a 
low of 30.3 percent of adults consuming fruits less than once a day in New Hampshire to a high of 50.8 percent consuming fruits less than once a day in Mississippi.  
Oregon had the best rates of vegetable consumption with 
a low of 15.3 percent of adults consuming vegetables less 
than once a day, compared with 32.5 percent in Louisiana 
consuming vegetables less than once a day. Obesity is one of the biggest drivers of preventable 
chronic diseases and healthcare costs in the United States.  

Currently, estimates for these costs range from $147 

billion to nearly $210 billion per year.28  In addition, job 
absenteeism related to obesity costs $4.3 billion annually.29  The 2012 edition of F as in Fat featured 
a modeling study projecting what the 

rise in adult obesity could be if rates 

continued on their historical trajectory.  

If things continue on this course, by 

2030, adult obesity could reach 50 

percent and combined medical costs 

combined medical costs associated with 

treating preventable obesity-related 

diseases are estimated to increase by 

between $48 billion and $66 billion 

per year, and the loss in economic 

productivity could be between $390 

billion and $580 billion annually.30  
As obesity rates rise, the risk of 

developing obesity-related health 

problems Š type 2 diabetes, coronary 

heart disease and stroke, hypertension, 
arthritis and obesity-related cancer Š 

increases exponentially.31  Twenty years 
ago, only 7.8 million Americans had 

been diagnosed with diabetes, and today, 

approximately 25.8 million Americans 

have diabetes.32   More than 75 percent 
of hypertension cases can be attributed 

to obesity.33  And, approximately one-third of cancer deaths are linked to 

obesity or lack of physical activity.34F as in Fat: Obesity Policy SeriesSECTION 2:  Cost Containment and Obesity Prevention COST CONTAINMENT AND OBESITY PREVENTION AUGUST 2013CURRENT STATUS:Obesity in America 2010 36%Obesity in America 2030 50% 24Reducing obesity and improving health can help lower costs through 
fewer trips to the doctor™s of˜ce, fewer

fewer readmissions to the hospital and

To date, there has not been a 
sustained, strong national focus on 

prevention to deliver the potential 

results.  A growing number of studies 
are demonstrating the positive 

returns that many strategies and 

programs can deliver for improving 

health, lowering healthcare costs 

and improving productivity.36  For 
instance, a 2008 study by the Urban

Americans could be spared from serious health problems 
and preventable diseases, and the country could save $29.8 billion in ˜ve years, $158 billion in 10 years and $611.7 billion in 20 years.35  25nutrition, and prevent smoking 
and other tobacco use could save 

the country more than $16 billion 

annually within ˜ve years.  That™s a 

return of $5.60 for every $1 invested.37  Out of the $16 billion, Medicare 

could save more than $5 billion, 

and Medicaid could save more than 

$1.9 billion.  Expanding the use of 

prevention programs would better 

inform the most effective, strategic 

public and private investments to 

yield the strongest results.FIVE-YEAR ROI ON $10 PER PERSON 
COMMUNITY-BASED INVESTMENT Medicaid  $1.9 billionMedicare  $5 billionPrivate Insurance $9.1 billionObesity has a major impact on direct and indirect health spending:
  Obese adults spend 42 percent more on healthcare costs than healthy-weight people.38  Annual medical claims costs per 100 full-time employees is $7,503 for healthy-weight workers and $51,091 for obese workers.    Obese children had $194 higher out-
patient visit expenditures, $114 higher 
prescription drug expenditures, and $25 
higher emergency room expenditures, 

based on a two-year Medical Expenditure 
Panel Survey.39  Overweight and obesity in 
childhood is associated with $14.1 billion 

in additional prescription drug, emergency 
room, and outpatient visit costs annually.  The average total health cost for a child 

treated for obesity under Medicaid is 
$6,730 annually, while the average 
health cost for all children covered by 

Medicaid is $2,446.40 The average total 
health cost for a child treated for obesity 
under private insurance is $3,743, while 
the average health cost for all children 

covered by private insurance is $1,108.41  Hospitalizations of children and youths 
with a diagnosis of obesity nearly doubled 
between 1999 and 2005, while total 
costs for children and youths with obesity-
related hospitalizations increased from 
$125.9 million in 2001 to $237.6 million 
in 2005, measured in 2005 dollars.42  Obesity-related job absenteeism costs 
$4.3 billion annually.43  Obesity is associated with lower 

productivity while at work (presenteeism), 
which costs employers $506 per obese 
worker per year.44  As a person™s BMI increases, so do the 

number of sick days, medical claims 
and healthcare costs associated with 
that person.45  A number of studies have shown 
obese workers have higher workers™ compensation claims.46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 WHY CONTAINING OBESITY-RELATED HEALTHCARE COSTS MATTERS:Total Annual Child Health Care ExpensesObesity-related Hospitalization Costs for Children and YouthsAnnual Medical Claims per 100 Full-time EmployeesAll

be a major focus of healthcare cost-containment efforts.  Funding for obesity-prevention programs will be 

important to achieve results in improving health and 

reducing healthcare costs.  Programs and policies 

should include a wide range of partners to ensure 
success, including businesses, schools, community- and 
faith-based organizations, economic and community 

developers, and health providers. 
  Because community-based obesity- and disease-prevention 

programs can signi˜cantly cut healthcare costs for 

communities, funding for evidence-based programs at all 

levels of government will continue to be important. 
  Community-based programs must include the ability to 

evaluate effectiveness and cost savings, and demonstrate 

how savings can be shared among partners, including 

businesses and the healthcare system, and reinvested to 
continue to support prevention activities.

and Cutting Costs:  
Continuing to Build the CaseCOMMENTARY FROM BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTERBY LISEL LOY, JD, Director, and  LAURA ZATZ, MPH, Senior Policy Analyst, Nutrition and Physical Activity Initiative,  Bipartisan Policy CenterOur nation is in crisis.  This is not just a health crisis, 
resulting from escalating rates of obesity and related 

chronic diseases, but also a budget crisis, with public 

and private stakeholders searching for ways to rein in 

spending in a tight ˜scal environment.  These crises are 

inextricably linked, given that rising health care costs are 
a primary driver of our national debt.  
THE STATUS QUO IS UNSUSTAINABLE.  We must change the way we approach both health and health care, and the 
ways we pay for both.  Doing so will 
require us ˜rst to identify the key drivers of this crisis, and the existing 
barriers to ˜xing it.  The situation 
is complex, and involves many 
stakeholders across multiple sectors.  CHANGE IS HARD. CHANGE THAT INVOLVES ENTRENCHED SYSTEMS AND INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR IS PARTICULARLY COMPLICATED. From our perspective, this means 
looking for big levers Š those that will 

result in the greatest progress toward 

our twin goals of improving health and 

cutting costs. The good news is there are 

many leaders and much activity in this 

space:  community-based organizations 

creating innovative partnerships to 

deliver healthier food options and 
more opportunities for physical activity; 

mayors and state governments leading 

the way on diabetes prevention efforts, 

and cutting costs for state employees by 

improving health; and, at the national 

level, a greater focus on prevention 

designed to shift our energy and 

resources toward less disease and lower 

health care spending.  
 28fasinfat.orgTAKING US FROM HERE TO THE NEXT STEP Š BIGGER-SCALE CHANGES SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM Š WILL REQUIRE AT LEAST THREE THINGS:1  Increasing investment in prevention Š combined with continued learning from existing efforts about what is working best to improve health and cut costs.  
While many existing initiatives are relatively young and small-scale, they 
re˚ect important leadership from 
all levels of government, non-pro˜t 
organizations and the private sector.  
These efforts represent laboratories 
of innovation and contribute to our ongoing collective learning about 
what works.  We need to continue to 
understand, share and promote these 
stories and their data so that a broader 
range of stakeholders understands the 
work being done and its impact.  In addition, many chronic diseases, 
unlike certain acute conditions, are 
responsive to changes in diet and 
physical activity levels.  Changing 
what we eat and how much we move is not necessarily easy, and it usually 
requires a combination of individual 
and environmental change.  But the 
opportunity is there.  3  Identifying areas of common ground and building partnerships among the full range of stakeholders.  Obesity and chronic disease are not 
just health issues.  They are economic 

and national security issues.  They 

affect our kids and their performance 

in school.  They affect the health of 

our businesses and the strength of our 

families and communities.  Everyone, 
from employers and insurers to doctors 

and community health workers to 

governors and mayors to food retailers 

and manufacturers, has a role to 

play and a stake in the outcomes Š 

improving health and cutting health 

care costs are essential to all of us. 
2  Increasing investment in robust data collection with longer follow-up, including 
analyzing and disseminating information about what is learned. Uncertainty about which strategies or 
policies yield the biggest bang for the 

buck chills investment in prevention.  

Government and private decision-makers 

need more information before making 

big investments that change the status 
quo.  We need to wisely invest existing 

resources, and leverage additional ones 

where possible, to build the evidence 

base and deliver that information to the 

decision-makers who need it.  
 29fasinfat.orgSource: Bipartisan Policy Center 30fasinfat.orgAt the Bipartisan Policy Center, we 
tried this integrated approach.  Our 

Health Care Cost Containment 

Initiative brought together leaders 

from the worlds of health and 

budget policy to develop consensus 

recommendations.  The report, 

ﬁA Bipartisan Rx for Patient-
Centered Care and System-wide 

Cost Containment,ﬂ recommended 

strategies to contain health care cost 
growth, while enhancing health care 

quality and value.i While much of the 
report focused on ways to improve 

quality and care in Medicare, the 

authors recognized that reducing 

the prevalence of chronic disease was 

essential to controlling costs.  The 

recommendations focus on building 

the evidence base and support for 

prevention as a tool in the larger cost 

containment strategy.  
We must continue to build success stories and test new 
prevention strategies.  Bringing together data on health 

outcomes and economic outcomes will help convince 

key decision-makers across sectors that prevention is a 
worthwhile investmentŠespecially in a time of constrained 
resources.  A successful national prevention strategy requires 

strong leadership and a broad, multi-faceted approach 

involving all sectors.  We must continue working together 

to identify what will stem both our chronic disease crisis and 

our health care cost crisis.THE BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER (BPC) launched its Nutrition and Physical Activity Initiative to reduce obesity and chronic disease and their associated 
health care costs through constructive engagement with the public, non-pro˜t, 
and private sectors.  Led by a bipartisan group of former U.S. Cabinet Secretaries 

Dan Glickman, Mike Leavitt, Donna Shalala, and Ann M. Veneman, the initiative 
released ﬁLots to Lose: How America™s Health and Obesity Crisis Threatens our 
Economic Futureﬂ in June 2012.  It featured 26 consensus recommendations to 

improve America's health and ˜scal crisis.i  A Bipartisan Rx for Patient-Centered Care and System-wide Cost Containment. Tom Daschle, Pete Domenici, 
Bill Frist and Alice Rivlin.  http://bipartisanpolicy.org/library/report/health-care-cost-containment National recommendations call for children and adolescents to get at least 60 minutes of physical activity 
per day, most of which should be moderate or vigorous 
in intensity.52 Currently, fewer than 30 percent of high school students were physically active at least 60 minutes 
per day on all seven days before a survey.53Efforts to provide physical education 
and physical activity often focus on 

schools because that is where school-
age children spend more than half of 

their waking hours.54 The Carol M. 
White Physical Education Program 

(PEP), the only federal funding stream 

for physical education programs, 

provides federal grants to school 

districts and community organizations 

that implement comprehensive 
physical ˜tness and nutrition programs 

designed to help students reach 

state physical education standards. 

Authorized by the Elementary and 

Secondary Education Act, (ESEA) $74.6 

million was appropriated for PEP in FY 2013.55 While all 50 states have enacted 
physical education standards or 

requirements, the scope of these laws 

and degree to which they are funded 

and enforced varies signi˜cantly. 
F as in Fat: Obesity Policy SeriesPhysical Activity In and Out of SchoolCURRENT STATUS:PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN AND OUT OF SCHOOLAUGUST 2013 32To address physical activity outside of school, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) provides grants to 
states and localities to fund walking and biking projects. 
More than half of states have adopted complete streets policies,57 which help ensure that roads accommodate all users by incorporating features such as sidewalks and bike lanes. A growing number of states also have enacted 
legislation to facilitate joint-use agreements,58 which provide members of a community with increased access to 
facilities like school athletic ˜elds and playgrounds.  ESEA was last reauthorized in 2002 
for ˜ve years; since 2007, Congress has 

enacted temporary extensions of the 

current law. In the interim, proposals 

that would make in-school physical 

education and physical activity a 

higher federal priority have included 

increasing resources for PEP, providing 

funding for schools to hire additional 

physical education teachers, and 

requiring school boards to collect and 

publish data on the extent to which they 

have made progress in meeting national 

physical education and physical activity 

standards. Should Congress attempt 

to reauthorize ESEA in 2013, they may 

consider these and other proposals. 
The new surface transportation 

law that Congress reauthorized in 

2012Šknown as Moving Ahead for 

Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-
21)Šcontinues to fund walking and 

biking projects. However, overall 

funding levels were cut, and a set 

of active transportation programs, 

including Safe Routes to School, was 

reorganized.  MAP-21 is authorized 

through the end of FY 2014, and 

Congress is likely to begin debating 

reauthorization of the law in 2013 or 

2014. Advocates are expected to press 

for the revival of such programs at 

higher funding levels.  
On the physical activity front, only 20 percent of school districts nationwide had a wellness policy that required 
daily recess, and children who are at the highest risk of obesity are the least likely to attend 
schools that do offer it.56  33WHY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL MATTERS:  Physical activity provides a wide variety of health bene˜ts for young people. Research has shown that physical activity can strengthen muscles and 
bones, help young people maintain a healthy weight, and reduce the likelihood of high blood pressure, cholesterol and 
type 2 diabetes.59  Well-structured physical education 
programs can result in children who are more active.61 In addition, providing short activity breaks during the school day can increase physical activity in students and improve some measures of health, such as muscle strength, 
endurance and ˚exibility.62  Cooperation between schools and 
communities also can help. When young people have access to school recreational facilities outside of school 
hours, they tend to be more active.63Research shows that physically 

active and ˜t children tend 
to have enhanced academic 
achievement and links 

physical activity breaks during 
the school day with better 
academic focus and better 

behavior in the classroom.60Source: Active Living Research 34Policy Recommendations:  School districts, with support from federal, state and local governments, should provide regular physical 
activity opportunities in schools and communities to 
help children and adolescents be active for at least 60 minutes per day.  Schools should conduct body mass index or other weight-related screenings to help assess rates of 
childhood obesity and evaluate the extent to which 
physical education and/or physical activity programs 
help students maintain or achieve a healthy weight.  Schools and communities nationwide should prioritize 
joint-use agreements to provide access to school 
facilities for recreational use outside of school hours.ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:Institute of Medicine: Educating the Student Body: Taking Physical Activity and Physical Education to School.  http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2013/Educating-the-Student-Body-Taking-Physical-Activity-and-Physical-Education-to-School.aspx

However, these requirements are often limited or not enforced, and 
many programs are inadequate.64    Many states have started enacting 

laws requiring schools to provide a cer-tain number of minutes and/or a speci-˜ed dif˜culty level of physical activity.  

Twelve speci˜cally require schools to 
provide physical activity or recess dur-ing the school day: Arizona, Colorado, 

Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, North 
Dakota, Ohio and Tennessee.  
Shared Use Agreements  22 states currently have laws 
supporting shared use of facilities, including: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, 
Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North 
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.Many communities do not have enough 

safe and accessible places for people 
to be physically active, indoors and 
out.  Schools often have gymnasiums, 

playgrounds, tracks and ˜elds, but they 
are not accessible to the community.  

Many schools keep their facilities closed 
after school hours for fears of liability in 
the event of an injury, vandalism, and 

the cost of maintenance and security.  
Some states and communities have 
laws encouraging or requiring schools 

to make facilities available for use by 
the community through shared or joint 
use agreements.65  These agreements 
allow school districts, local governments 
and community-based organizations to 
overcome common concerns, costs and 

responsibilities that come along with 
opening school property to the public 
after hours.  
 36 TFAH  RWJF  fasinfat.orgHEALTH ASSESSMENT AND HEALTH EDUCATIONPhysical activity, nutrition and other factors affect the overall health of students.  A number of states have instituted legislation 
to conduct health assessments to help parents, schools and communities help understand the health of children and teens, and 
nearly every state requires some form of health education classes for students.
Health Assessments21 states currently have legislation that requires BMI screening or weight-related assessments other than BMI.    States with BMI screening requirements:  Arkansas, 
California*, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont and West Virginia.    States with other weight-related screening requirements:  
Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, South Carolina and Texas.*As of July 2010, statewide distribution of diabetes risk information to school children, California Education Code 
§ 49452.7, replaced individual BMI reporting, California Education Code § 49452.6.  BMI and other health assessments are intended to help schools and communities assess rates of childhood obesity, 
educate parents and students, and serve as a means to evaluate obesity-prevention and -control programs in that school and community.  The American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP)  recommends that BMI should be calculated and plotted annually for all youths as part of normal health supervision within the child™s medical home, and the Institute of Medicine 
(IOM) recommends annual school-based BMI screenings.66, 67  Health EducationOnly two states Š Colorado and Oklahoma Š do not require 
schools to provide health education.  Health education curricula often include community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, 
personal health, prevention and control of disease, and sub-stance use and abuse.  The goal of school health education is 
to prevent premature deaths and disabilities by improving the 
health literacy of students.68According to a 2006 CDC study, health education standards 
and curricula vary greatly from school to school.69    The percentage of states that require districts or schools 
to follow national or state health education standards increased from 60.8 percent in 2000 to almost 75 percent in 2006; the percentage of districts that required this of 
their schools increased from 68.8 percent to 79.3 percent.  Nearly 14 percent of states and 42.6 percent of districts 
required each school to have a school health education coordinator. 37fasinfat.orgThe Perry County School District in Marion, Alabama, 
has a simple philosophy: we strive to prepare lifelong 

learners who will shape the future. However, in order 

for them to shape the future, our children need a 
healthy start. 
A Healthy Future for Students, One Step at a TimeSince 2002, I have served as 
superintendent of the Perry County 

Schools. I am proud to call this area my 

home, but the statistics in my state and 

county are dire. Alabama has the 11th-
highest rate of childhood obesity in the 

country. This problem doesn™t end with 

childhood, it extends into adulthood: 

according to the 2013 County Health 
Rankings, more than 40 percent of 

adults here in Perry County are obese, 

with more than one-third reporting that 

they do not engage in physical activity. 
As superintendent, I consider the 1,700 
students in our district to be my own, and 

I am determined to provide each one of 

them with a better, healthier future. 
Getting our children moving during the school day has been 
critical to our success. 
In our school system, we place a high priority on physical education. We 
require a minimum of 30 minutes of 
physical education every day for all of 
our elementary school students, while 
our high school students are required 
to take one year of physical education 
to meet graduation requirements. 
Our next goal is to make physical 
education a yearly requirement for 
our high school students.  Being active during the school day 
extends beyond the gymnasium. 

Therefore, we™ve built new 

playgrounds for recess. Students take 
part in a ﬁJammin™ Minuteﬂ to get some 

quick physical activity breaks during 

class timeŠour teachers report that 

getting some excess energy out makes 

students more attentive and on-task 

once instruction resumes. We host 

walks for students, complete with music 

and marching bands, in which parents 

and the community participate.  These 

events raise the entire community™s 

awareness of the importance of our 

children and adults being physically 

active.  All of this helps make the 

school day more enjoyable and helps 

our children be better learners.For our obesity-prevention efforts, we received Silver National Recognition Awards in 2010 from the Alliance for a 
Healthier Generation. EXPERT COMMENTARYBY JOHN P. HEARD III Superintendent, Perry County School District 38fasinfat.orgIN MY VIEW, THE SCHOOL DAY EXTENDS BEYOND THE OPENING AND FINAL BELLSWe have a responsibility to make 
sure that students get to school safely 

each morning and return home 

safely each afternoon. We™ve received 

two Safe Routes to School grants to 

˜x sidewalks, install new bike racks 

and replace old signage around our 

buildings. These improvements will 

encourage students to walk and bike to 

school, allowing them to start and end 

their day school day in a healthier way. 
I believe that schools can also play a 
big role in helping communities be 

active all year round. That is why we™ve 

signed joint-use agreements with the 

Perry County government to keep our 
facilities open after hours and on the 

weekends for all to enjoy.  And it™s not 

just during the school yearŠwe keep 

our gymnasiums open for several weeks 

during the summer months as well. 
In all of these instances, we™ve made certain to communicate openly and 
directly with students, parents, faculty 
and staff. We™ve established school 
health committees that meet regularly 
to provide feedback on current 
initiatives and propose new ones. 
We™ve made signi˜cant changes to the 
nutrition content of the food we serve 
to complement our physical activities. 
We™ve also received full commitment and buy-in from our local board of 
education members. I have been an educator for more than three decades. It is mind-
boggling to me when I read reports 
thatŠin large part due to the obesity 
epidemicŠthe current generation 
of young people may be the ˜rst 
in American history to live sicker 
and die younger than their parents™ 
generation. So I refuse to sit idly by 
and watch this happen.  We may not 
be the most well-known school district 
out there, but I ˜rmly believe we can 
be a model for others to follow. ﬁEvery child has the potential to change the world.  We can help them get there, one healthier step at a time.ﬂ  The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, enacted in 
December 2010, authorized the ˜rst update to nutrition 

standards for school meals in more than a decade, and 

the ˜rst update to standards for school snacks and drinks 
in more than 30 years.Today, schools across the country 
are serving healthier breakfasts and 

lunches because of the updated 

school meal nutrition standards that 

went into effect for the beginning of 

the 2012-13 school year. Meals now 

include more fruits, vegetables, whole 

grains and low-fat dairy products, 

and less sugar and unhealthy fats.  

Students now have access to free 

water at lunch, and over time meals 

will contain less sodium. To help 

schools implement these changes, 
the law also increased the federal 

reimbursement for meals that meet 

the new standards by six cents.Schools also sell foods and drinks outside of breakfast and lunch in 
vending machines, school stores and a 
la carte lines. These items, sometimes 
called competitive foods because 
they compete with school meals 
for students™ spending, are often 
unhealthy and can include salty chips, 
candy and sugary drinks.F as in Fat: Obesity Policy SeriesSchool Foods and Beverages CURRENT STATUS:SCHOOL FOODS AND BEVERAGES AUGUST 2013 40  Millions of children rely on the school 
meals program.  For some children, the 
only meals they have are in school.  During 
the average school day in 2011, more 

than 31 million children ate school lunch, 
and 12.5 million ate school breakfast.73 Children and teens can consume up to half 

of their total daily calories at school.74 
  Strong school nutrition policies can have 
a positive impact on children™s health. 
Research shows that students who 
received free or reduced-price lunchesŠ
who tend to be from lower-income 
familiesŠhad higher obesity rates than 
those who did not participate in the lunch 

program, but the gap was much smaller 
in states with strong meal standards.75  Kids eat less of their lunch, consume 
more fat, take in fewer nutrients 
and gain weight when schools sell 
unhealthy snacks and drinks outside of 

meals.76,77,78,79,80,81,82  Children and teens 
in states with strong laws restricting 
the sale of unhealthy snack foods and 
beverages in school gained less weight 

over a three-year period than those living 
in states with no such policies.83   Healthier standards also can help schools™ budgets. A recent health impact assessment found that, when schools serve healthier snacks and 
drinks, they generally see their total food service revenues increase.84WHY SCHOOL FOODS AND BEVERAGES MATTER:An analysis of data from the USDA found that schools are selling 400 billion calories from junk foods each year.71On June 27, 2013, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
issued an interim ˜nal rule updating nutrition standards for 

school snacks and drinks for schools that participate in the 

National School Lunch Program. The new standards, called 
ﬁSmart Snacks in School,ﬂ call for healthier competitive 
foods with more fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, whole 

grains and lean proteins as main ingredients. They also 

sets limits for sugar, fat and sodium in such items. The new 

standards apply to foods and beverages sold outside of the 

school meals program on school campus at any time during 

the school day. More than 240,000 people commented on 

the proposed standards, with 97 percent in favor of a strong 

˜nal rule. Competitive foods and beverages must meet the 
nutrition standards speci˜ed in the interim ˜nal rule by the 
beginning of the 2014-2015 school year.Average daily number of children who ate school meals in 2011Percentage of daily calories consumed at schoolBreakfast 12.5 millionLunch 31 million50% 41Policy Recommendations:  The U.S. Department of Agriculture should continue to monitor state and local implementation of both 
updated school meal and snack food and beverage 
standards, and provide adequate training and technical assistance where needed to states, localities, industry and school nutrition organizations.       Adequate funding is an important strategy to ensure 
schools have the tools and resources they need to 
provide healthy and appealing meals necessary to meet 
nutrition standards set by USDA.ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:Kids™s Safe & Healthful Foods Project: Health Impact Assessment: National Nutrition Standards for Snack and a la Carte Foods  and Beverages Sold in Schools.  http://www.pewhealth.org/uploadedFiles/PHG/Content_Level_Pages/Reports/KS_HIA_revised%20WEB%20FINAL%2073112.pdf

2010 also required USDA to release 
new national standards for competitive 
foods in schools.  The interim ˜nal rule 

for competitive foods was released in 
June 2013.  The standards for foods 
and beverages are minimum standards 

that local educational agencies, school 
food authorities and schools are 
required to meet, but state agencies 

and/or local school districts have 
the discretion to establish their own 
standards for non-program foods sold to 

children, as long as those standards are 
consistent with the federal standards.  
USDA de˜nes competitive foods as any food or beverage served or sold 
at school that is not part of the USDA school meals program.86  These foods are sold in à la carte lines, in school vending machines, in school stores, or through bake sales.   35 states and Washington, D.C., 

have nutritional standards for 
competitive foods: Alabama, 
Arizona, Arkansas, California, 

Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, 
Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, 
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, 

Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, 
New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, 

Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, 
Rhode Island, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, 

Virginia, Washington and 
 West Virginia. 
  29 states and Washington, D.C.,

Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, 

Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, 
Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New

An analysis by CDC researchers found 
that the content of these laws and policies 

varied dramatically by state and by grade 
level within a state.87  More information

drinking recommended levels of water during the school day.88  Research suggests that children who drink 
more water consume less of other beverages and less sugar.89  Although water fountains have been available in most schools for decades, there are issues that discourage students 
from drinking water at school. For example, many schools do not have enough water fountains to supply all 
of the students, and most schools do not make cups available to encourage students to take more water from the 
fountains. The cost of providing cups may be a barrier in some schools.90  The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act 
of 2010 requires schools to provide easily accessible, clean water to 
students at no cost.  Farm-to-School Programs  31 states and Washington, D.C., 

currently have established farm-to-school programs: Alabama, 
Alaska, California, Colorado, 

Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, 
Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, 

Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, 
Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, 
New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, 

Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, 
Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West 

Virginia and Wisconsin.  Many of 

these programs cover only select 
students or schools in these states 
rather than all.  
Farm-to-school programs have 

shown results in improving students™ 
nutritional intake.91 For example, a 
study by researchers at the University 

of California, Davis found that farm-to-school programs not only increase 

consumption of fruits and vegetables, 
but actually change eating habits, 
causing students to choose healthier 

options at lunch.92  A recent health 
impact assessment examining the 
Oregon farm-to-school reimbursement 
law found that the law would create 

and maintain jobs for Oregonians, 
increase student participation 
in the school meals program, 

improve household food security 
and strengthen connections within 
Oregon™s food economy.93 45fasinfat.orgAs I discussed the pro˜le of a young clinic patient with a colleague, my colleague said, ﬁIf I didn™t know better, I™d 
say she has type 2 diabetes. But she™s 15, and we all know 
that 15-year-olds don™t get type 2.ﬂTaking Nutrition from the Clinic to the ClassroomOr do we? I still remember the day in clinic when I saw my ˜rst patient with type 
2 diabetes. That, in itself, was not 
noteworthy; I was a dietitian and well 
acquainted with the condition. But 
this case was exceptional because 
I worked in pediatrics. Until then, 
everything I saw in practice con˜rmed 
what the textbooks on the subject said: 
type 1 diabetes happened to children, 
and type 2 diabetes happened to 
adults. But on that day in 1999, the 
rules changed.Clinics were the ˜rst to see what we now understand is a childhood 
obesity crisis. Children and teens 
were coming in, struggling with 
their weight and presenting with 
obesity-related diseases such as high 
cholesterol, high blood pressure and 
type 2 diabetes Š illnesses that were 
historically seen almost exclusively 
in adults. As I worked with these 
families and learned about their lives, it was clear that the epidemic was 
expanding. Yet outside of the clinic, 
few seemed to notice, which only 
made the problem worse. As I worked in weight-management and endocrinology clinics, I sat with 
families and tried to help them. 
But their journey was dif˜cult. 
Between trying to gain access to more 
nutritious food options, ˜nding time 
to prepare meals, and navigating the 
numerous snack and fast-food venues 
that surrounded them, their path to a 
healthier life was an uphill struggle.But one obstacle stood out from the 
rest: the place to which these parents 

entrusted their children every day.  In 

this environment, children were a 

captive audience; there was a wide range 

of less-healthy foods and a large number 

of adults consuming those options, 

offering them as rewards, and selling 

them alongside more-balanced meals. 
 EXPERT COMMENTARYBY JESSICA DONZE BLACK, RD, MPH 
Director, Kids™ Safe & Healthful Foods Project 46fasinfat.orgKids were learning to eat snacks and drink sugar-sweetened beverages from 
vending machines because they were 
quick and easy. Doughnuts were sold 
for breakfast to pay for uniforms, and 
candy to cover the cost of a class trip. 
These kinds of ﬁtreatsﬂ were even 
offered as rewards because Š it was 
believed Š that is what successful 
children deserved. Day after day I™d sit with children 
who were struggling to make healthy 

decisions in a sea of less-healthy 

options and think about how much 

better their lives would be if we could 

just make wholesome choices common 

and easy. If we could just change from 

offering hungry students cookies to 

offering them an apple or a pear, 

we would set them up to make good 

decisions no matter what they picked. 
These children inspired me to get 
involved in the policy arena and 

continue to motivate me to make 
sure that all foods sold in schools are 

safe and healthy. Kids spend more 

time in school than any place other 

than home. They deserve schools that 

help them reach their full potential 

Š academically, socially, emotionally 

and physically. 
The good news is that the pendulum is swinging back. Thousands of 
schools are improving their nutrition 
environment and demonstrating 
that they can serve healthy food 
while keeping their budgets solvent. 
Some are inviting kids to be the taste 
testers of healthy options. Some 
have leveraged their local farms to 
get fresh fruits and vegetables at a 
reduced cost. Some are ˜lling their 
vending machines with lower-fat and 
lower sodium foods, while others 
have stopped selling snack foods and 
beverages in schools completely. As the parent of four young children, 
I know how challenging it can be to 
serve nutritious meals and convince my 

kids to eat them.  For the people who 

prepare school lunches each day for 

millions of American children, the task 

is far more dif˜cult.  But I encourage 

schools to remain committed to 

serving nutritious options and to keep 

˜nding ways to make food taste good. 

School districts all across the country 

are already doing so, and research 

shows that these changes are helping 

students maintain a healthy weight. We 

also know that healthier kids do better 

in school.Today children consume up to half of their daily calories at school. If schools  

and those of us who want healthy food 
for our children can work together 
to ensure, at a minimum, that the 
foods kids consume there are healthy, 
perhaps in a not-too-distant future 
clinics reporting large numbers of 
adolescents with type 2 diabetes will 
only be a memory.Schools.Schools are supposed to be safe places that nurture students™ 
minds and bodies. But somewhere along the way we lost sight of 
encouraging and offering healthy food. Finding new ways to balance 
budgets left too many convenient snack foods and beverages with 

little nutritional value available. And thus the lessons being taughtŠeven if unintentionallyŠwere moving us in the wrong direction. According to CDC, more than half of Americans live with a chronic disease, many of which are related to obesity, 
poor nutrition and/or physical inactivity, and a majority 
of these diseases could be prevented.94A wide range of evidence-based studies 
have found that effective disease-
prevention programs in communities 

can reduce obesity rates, improve 

nutrition and increase physical activity  

among residents.  This research has 

informed the creation of three major 

components of the Affordable Care 

Act (ACA) that focus on obesity 

prevention:  the National Prevention

support for prevention. It supports 
programs, medical screenings, and 
research that are aligned with the 
goals of the NPS. More than $2 billion 
has been appropriated through the 
PPHF since Fiscal Year (FY) 2010, with 
a total of $14.5 billion scheduled to be 
allocated through FY 2022. One of the primary parts of PPHF is the funding for CTGs, and CTGs 
were intended to address the leading 
causes of chronic disease to improve Americans™ health and reduce 
long-term healthcare costs. CDC 
scientists have identi˜ed many of the 
top evidence-based approaches to 
preventing diseases, including ways to 
reduce obesity rates.  Communities 
receiving CTGs are required to 
base their efforts on one or more of 
these proven approaches and meet 
measurable, achievable outcomes.  
Fund-supported CTG initiatives are 
required to incorporate Healthy 
People 2020 goals in program plans 
and strategies.  POTENTIAL PERCENT GROWTH IN OBESITY-RELATED HEALTHCARE COSTS BY 2030 IF THE CURRENT TRAJECTORY

In an effort to reduce childhood 
obesity, the county will use its CTG 
to establish a Healthy Food Zone 
initiative in order to decrease access 
to unhealthy foods and beverages 
near schools. The initiative will 
reach almost 100,000 school-age 
children in the county.  MarylandŠjust over one-third of 

high school students in Maryland

of physical activity.  The state will 

use its CTG to collaborate with 

school districts to improve physical 

education, encourage walking and 

biking to school, and coordinate 

physical activity breaks and other 

physical activity clubs.  The 

Maryland plan to increase access

related chronic diseasesWHY NATIONAL PREVENTION EFFORTS MATTER:  In the United States, seven out of 10 deaths are caused by chronic diseases, and three-quarters of every dollar spent on medical costs is used to 
treat chronic diseases and associated risk factors.99  CTGs focus on creating healthier communities to reduce chronic 
disease burdens through a range of community interventions.100  A range of factors beyond the healthcare 
system Š including housing, education, transportation, the availability of affordable healthy food, and conditions 
in the workplace and the environment Š impact Americans™ health and risk for obesity. Working across agencies 
to identify and develop reforms can have a major impact on the health of 
all Americans.101, 102  If every federal agency prioritizes obesity prevention, the American people will see the bene˜ts.  Two resources Š CDC™s The Guide 
to Community Preventive Services and 
The New York Academy of Medicine™s 
Compendium of Proven Community-Based 

Prevention Programs Š have identi˜ed 
speci˜c programs with proven results in 
reducing obesity and related diseases, 

including heart disease, hypertension, 
diabetes and some forms of cancer.103, 104  CTGs allow local communities to tailor their approaches to local needs 
and to work with partners from a 
range of sectors to design strategies 
based on the most pressing needs 
of their populations.  More than 70 
percent of awardees are focusing their 
strategies on addressing nutrition 
through a variety of activities.96  In 2011, $103 million was awarded to 
61 communities in 36 states, serving 
approximately 120 million Americans.  

In 2012, $70 million was awarded to 
40 communities, directly impacting 
about 9.2 million Americans.  Twenty 
percent of all programs are in rural or 
frontier areas.97  According to CDC, at current funding levels, CTGs impact 
130 million people Š more than four 
out of 10 Americans.  For example:98 Approximately 16 percent of school-age children are obese in TexasTwo-thirds of high school students 
in Maryland do not engage in the 
recommended levels of physical activity 51  The National Prevention Strategy recommendations should be fully implemented across all of the 
participating agencies.  Each agency should highlight 
how their programs can directly or indirectly affect physical activity and nutrition opportunities for the Americans they serve.   All levels of government should also encourage  
public-private partnerships in their prevention  
strategies and activities.  Continued funding of prevention programs, such as 
the Community Transformation Grants, will be an 
important strategy going forward.Policy Recommendations:ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:National Prevention Strategy:  America™s Plan for Better Health and Wellness.

Analyses from a number of organizations, including the 
Institute of Medicine, The New York Academy of Medicine, CDC and a range of other experts have found that public 
health has been severely underfunded for decades and does not receive suf-˜cient support to carry out many core 
functions, including programs to prevent disease and obesity.105Much of the federal support for obesity 
prevention is through grants to states 
distributed through CDC™s National 
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention 
and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP).  The 

Prevention and Public Health Fund was 
created to supplement, not supplant, 
support for prevention programs.  The 

Prevention Fund includes many mea-sures aimed at obesity prevention, such 
as through the National Prevention Strat-
egy and as one of the key goals of the 
CTGs.  However, discretionary funding for 
chronic disease prevention has been cut 

for the past four years.  In addition, the 
Fund also has experienced cuts from the 
originally intended allocation levels.  
So while federal chronic disease prevention funding reached an all-time high of $1.13 billion in FY 2012, cuts 
to discretionary programs and the Prevention Fund caused total funding for chronic disease prevention to decrease 
by 17 percent in FY 2013.  The ACA originally allocated $21 billion for the Prevention Fund from FY 2010 to FY 2022.  The Fund already has 
experienced cuts or reallocations of nearly one-third, dropping it to $14.5 billion, nearly a 32.3 percent cut.

the national level, state-level public 
health funding also has experienced 
signi˜cant cuts, with median per 

capita spending decreasing from 
$33.71 in FY 2008 to $27.40 in FY 
2012.  This represents a cut of more 

than $1.15 billion, based on the total 
states™ budgets from those years, 
which would be $1.9 billion adjusted 

for in˚ation.106  Budget cuts have led 
state and local health departments to 
cut more than 45,700 jobs across the 
country since 2008.107  Dwindling funding has meant decreased 

and inconsistent support for the vari-
ous categorical disease-prevention and 
health-promotion programs. For example, 
in FY 2012, while all 50 states and D.C. 

received some funding to work on dia-betes, only 25 states received federal 
funding to focus speci˜cally on nutrition, 

physical activity and obesity.  In FY 2013, 
CDC/NCCDPHP released a funding oppor-tunity announcement (FOA) that brings to-
gether four programs that were previously 
standalone programs: heart disease and 
stroke; nutrition, physical activity and 
obesity; school health; and diabetes. The 

FOA, entitled State Public Health Actions 

to Prevent and Control Diabetes, Heart 
Disease, Obesity and Associated Risk Fac-tors and Promote School Health, aims to 
ef˜ciently implement cross-cutting strate-gies in a variety of settings that improve 
multiple chronic diseases and conditions, 

while maintaining categorical appro-priation funding levels and performance 
targets.  Coordination could improve the 

impact of efforts to prevent obesity and 
conditions related to obesity, such as 
diabetes and heart disease.PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH FUND ALLOCATIONS (FY 2010 TO 2022):(CURRENT FUNDING UNDER HR 3630 VS. FUNDING ESTABLISHED BY ACA) ($ IN BILLIONS, FY 2010 TO 2022)$2.25$2.00

Through implementation of Patient

Partners are working to reduce the 
incidences of childhood obesity and 
lessen the healthcare costs, emotional 
damage, and long-term diseases and 
disabilities associated with obesity. Childhood obesity is complex and not easily addressed by any one approach.  TOUCH has brought together community-
based organizations, multidisciplinary strategies and diverse communities to 
address the most recognizable factors contributing to childhood obesity.  It is anticipated that 
these system, environmental and policy enhancements will positively impact the health, 
well-being and longevity of children living in Broward County, Florida.  More than 29 million Americans lack access to healthy affordable foods.  They live in ﬁfood deserts,ﬂ meaning 
they do not have a supermarket or supercenter within a 
mile of their home if they live in an urban area, or within 10 miles of their home if they live in a rural area.108  Families living in lower-income 
neighborhoods and in communities 

of color are particularly hard 

hit:  ZIP codes with the highest 

concentration of Blacks have 

about half the number of chain 

supermarkets compared with ZIP codes with the highest concentration 

of Whites and ZIP codes with the 

highest concentrations of Latinos 

have only a third as many.109  Many 
of these same neighborhoods 

also are struggling with high rates 
of obesity, unemployment and 

depressed economies.Increasing access to healthy foods has become a priority for policy-makers 
across the country.  One strategy is 
the use of Healthy Food Financing 
Initiatives (HFFI), which operate at 
the federal, state and local level and 
provide grants and loans to full-service 
supermarkets or farmers™ markets in 
return for locating in lower-income 
urban or rural communities.F as in Fat: Obesity Policy SeriesHealthy Affordable FoodsCURRENT STATUS:HEALTHY AFFORDABLE FOODSAUGUST 2013 60For example, 17 states and the 
District of Columbia are pursuing 

HFFIs in a variety of different 

forms.  California has established a 

public-private partnership to fund 

the California FreshWorks Fund, 

which has raised $272 million to 

bring grocery stores, fresh produce 

markets, and other healthy food retail 

stores to communities that do not 

have them.110 In New Orleans, the 
City Council has prioritized healthy 

food retail as a strategy in rebuilding 

after Hurricane Katrina.  Following 

recommendations from its Food 

Policy Advisory Committee, the city 

created the Fresh Food Retailer 

Initiative to provide direct ˜nancial 

assistance to retail businesses by 

awarding forgivable and/or low-
interest loans to supermarkets and 
other fresh food retailers.111 The most successful program to date is the Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative (FFFI), which since 2004 has ˜nanced supermarkets and other fresh food outlets in 78 urban and rural areas serving 500,000 city residents.112  In the process, FFFI also has created or retained 4,860 jobs in underserved neighborhoods and increased local tax revenues. Direct food assistance programs are another strategy to increase access to 
healthy foods. Nutrition assistance 
programs comprise more than two-
thirds of the federal Farm Bill. The 
largest is the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP), which 
provided $74.6 billion in bene˜ts 
to 46.6 million Americans in Fiscal 
Year 2012.113 In addition to providing monthly bene˜ts, SNAP™s nutrition 
education component provides 
federal grants to states for efforts to 
help participants get the most out of 
their bene˜ts by encouraging smart 
shopping and healthy eating habits.114 SNAP also licenses eligible farmers™ 
markets so participants can use their 
bene˜ts at those locations.  61The federal government funds SNAP entirely through the Department of Agriculture; the national HFFI is funded through the Departments of Treasury, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture.  More than $31 billion in SNAP funding has been 
allocated to date in Fiscal Year 2013; in addition, as of 2012, $77 million in federal grants and loans has been awarded to community development organizations to support a myriad of food  access 
projects in underserved communities.115 23.5 millionAmericans don™t have access to a

these stores to smaller grocery stores and convenience stores.116  Adults living in neighborhoods with super-markets or with supermarkets and grocery 
stores have the lowest rates of obesity 
(21 percent) and  those living in neighbor-
hoods with no supermarkets and access 
to only convenience stores, smaller gro-cery stores, or both had the highest rates 

(32 percent to 40 percent obesity).117   Blacks living in a census tract with 
a supermarket are more likely to meet dietary guidelines for fruits and vegetables, and for every additional 
supermarket in a tract, produce consumption rose 32 percent. Among Whites, each additional supermarket 
corresponded with an 11 percent increase in produce consumption.118  Adults with no supermarkets within a mile of their homes are 25 percent to 46 percent less likely to have a healthy diet than those with the most 
supermarkets near their homes.119  New and improved grocery stores can 
catalyze commercial revitalization in a community. An analysis of the economic impacts of ˜ve new stores that opened 
with HFFI assistance found that, for four of the stores, total employment sur-rounding the supermarket increased at a 
faster rate than citywide trends.12032%Percent of African Americans who live in a census tract with a supermarketPercent of Whites who live in a census tract with a supermarket8%31%30 MilesSource: PolicyLink, The Grocery Gap 62  The federal government, states and cities should continue to prioritize and fund Healthy Food Financing

than two-thirds of Farm Bill funding.  Two main vehicles provide ˜nancial 
support for millions of low-income 
individuals and families to purchase 

food:  the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program  provided $74.6 
billion in bene˜ts to 47.7 million 

Americans in Fiscal Year 2012, and 
$308 million was appropriated for The 
Emergency Food Assistance Program 

(TEFAP) to support low-income and 
elderly Americans in Fiscal Year 2012.  
Nearly half of SNAP participants are 
under 18 years old. In addition to 
providing bene˜ts for all eligible food 
items, many states and cities have 

established public-private partnerships 
to increase the value of SNAP dollars 
for the purchase of healthy foods. 
SNAP also contains a nutrition education 
component, which provides federal grants 
to states for efforts to help participants 
get the most out of their bene˜ts by 

encouraging smart shopping and healthy 
eating habits.121  The Farm Bill also 
authorizes the Fresh Fruit and Vegetables 

Program and community-based nutrition 
programs, such as farmers™ markets.STATE SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGE TAXES  34 states and Washington, D.C.,

7 percent or below, and of those with a 
soda tax, 14 have a tax rate of 5 percent 

or less.129Researchers at Yale University 

estimated that, if a national soda

beverage daily, and sugar-sweetened beverages were the top calorie source for teens.134, 135  Nearly half of 2- to 3-year olds consume a 
sugar-sweetened beverage daily, and a quarter to a third consume whole 
rather than low-fat or nonfat milk.136, 137, 138, 139 Children ages 2 to 5 are estimated to consume 124 calories per day Š 7 percent of total daily energy Š from sugar-sweetened 
beverages.140  Increased health risks related 

to sugar-sweetened beverage 
consumption:  A number of studies 
have shown a signi˜cant link 

between sugar-sweetened beverage 
consumption and weight gain in 
children.141  Adults who drink a soda 
or more per day are 27 percent more 
likely to be overweight than those 
who do not drink sodas, regardless of

higher risk for a heart attack.142, 143, 144   
  Improved health from lowering 
sugar-sweetened beverage consumption:  Children who reduced their consumption of added sugar 
by the equivalent of one can of soda per day had improved glucose and insulin levels.  Eliminating one can of 
soda per day, regardless of any other diet or exercise change, can reduce a child™s risk for type 2 diabetes.145  65fasinfat.orgAccess to Healthy Food is About More Than Just HealthŠIt™s 
About CommunityPeople of New Orleans love to tell me stories about Circle Food Store. The grocery store was more than a source 
of fresh, affordable, high-quality produce in a city where 
too many neighborhoods lacked access to healthy foods. 
For nearly 70 years, the red-roofed Circle Food Store was 
a community gathering spot, a point of pride, almost a tradition. That was before Hurricane Katrina.In the aftermath of the storm, the store and the working-class 7th 
Ward neighborhood surrounding 
it were ˚ooded chest-deep. So 
much was destroyed by the water, 
including the community™s anchor 
supermarket. Across a city that already 
had inadequate healthy food access, 
more than half of the supermarkets 
shuttered post-Katrina. That was 
nearly eight years ago. The story of Circle Food Store is a devastating one. But so are the 
numerous tales of communities across 
the country that lack access to healthy, 
affordable food. They are part of 
a long-term trend of supermarkets 
leaving urban and rural areas for the 
suburbs, forcing parents to travel long distances to feed their families or to 
shop at small corner stores, where 
offerings are often more expensive 
and less nutritious. In the 7th Ward and elsewhere, the dangers of a lack of access to 
affordable, healthy food are the same, 
leading to an increased risk for obesity 
and other diet-related diseases. When I talk about lack of access, 
which affects more than 30 million 

Americans, and obesity Š af˚icting 

more than one-third of all adults and 

12.5 million children Š I worry that the 

problem can seem overwhelming, even 

unsolvable.  But lessons we™ve learned 

in Philadelphia over the past 20 years 

show that a solution is possible.ﬁI™ve had people calling me,ﬂ

Boudreaux will say, ﬁtelling me it

the city has signi˜cantly reduced the 
rate of obesity among Philadelphia 
schoolchildren -- by 5 percent between 
2006 and 2010. It shows even larger 
declines in obesity rates among 
African American boys and Hispanic 
girls, the largest documented to date, 
and a critical ˜nding, as African 
Americans and Hispanics are more at 
risk to become obese.Here™s the important thing for me: the study doesn™t credit one 
program or policy as the hero of 
this success story. Instead, it suggests 
that Philadelphia™s comprehensive 
approach to obesity prevention Š a 
combination of increased access to 
healthy food, nutrition education and 
exercise Š may be responsible for 
reversing the obesity trend.One program that™s been a piece of 
the puzzle is Pennsylvania™s Fresh Food 
Financing Initiative, which The Food 

Trust advocated for and co-managed 

with The Reinvestment Fund. Created 

by State Rep. Dwight Evans in 2004, 

the program made ˜nancing available 

to grocers willing to open their doors 

in lower-income neighborhoods. 
I™ve watched this approach spread 
through other states Š New York, 

California and New Jersey Š and 

reach the federal level, with the 

national Healthy Food Financing 

Initiative providing resources to 

organizations working to improve 

healthy food access nationwide. 
At the local level, the New Orleans Food 

Policy Advisory Committee and the 

leadership of Mayor Mitch Landrieu 

led to the establishment of the Fresh 

Food Retailer Initiative. Modeled on the 

successful Pennsylvania program and 

co-managed by the city of New Orleans, 

the Community Development Finance 

Institution Hope Enterprise and The 

Food Trust, the Fresh Food Retailer 

Initiative is bringing grocery stores back 

to New Orleans.

Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Store renovations 
began in January 2013, and the store is 
expected to reopen this summer. Better-for-you Foods:  It™s Just Good BusinessObesity is the foremost public health problem facing our nation today, and it™s clear that the packaged food and 
restaurant industries must be part of the solution. Many companies are already embracing the challenge and are 
introducing healthier, lower-calorie 
versions of popular foods and 
beverages. Several corporations have 
also pledged substantial voluntary 
commitments through initiatives, such 
as the Healthy Weight Commitment 
Foundation (HWCF), the Kids 
LiveWell program launched by the 
National Restaurant Association, 
and the Partnership for a Healthier 
America, with First Lady Michelle 
Obama serving as Honorary Chair. All of this is good news not only for 
consumers, but also for the companies 

themselves and their shareholders. 

The reason? A growing number 

of food, beverage and restaurant 

companies have found that selling 
lower-calorie, ﬁbetter-for-youﬂ products 

is also good for business.  Their success 

should inspire risk-averse companies 

that worry about whether customers 

will accept healthier new products and 

menu items.Traditional high-calorie, supersized fare no longer serves the needs of the 
growing number of grocery shoppers 
and restaurant patrons who want 
smaller portions, more wholesome 
products and lighter versions of 
traditional favorites.  Studies by 
the Natural Marketing Institute 
have shown that at least a third of 
America™s consumers are committed 
to healthier eating; a Harris poll has 
found that 58 percent of restaurant 
patrons now consider ﬁhealthy menu 
itemsﬂ in choosing where to dine.    EXPERT COMMENTARYBY HANK CARDELLO, Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute and director of the Institute™s Obesity Solutions Initiative67fasinfat.orgPercentage of Patrons Who Consider ﬁHealthy 
Menu Itemsﬂ in Choosing Where To Dine58% Three rigorous studies conducted by 
the Hudson Institute over the past 

two years have established a clear link 

between healthier, lower-calorie foods 

and healthier food company ˜nancials.  

Hudson™s 2011 study of the consumer 

packaged goods (CPG) industry, Better-
for-You Foods: It™s Just Good Business, found 

that between 2006 and 2011, 15 leading 

food and beverage companies that grew 

their lower-calorie/ﬁbetter-for-youﬂ 

products enjoyed superior sales growth, 

operating margins and operating 

pro˜t growth. Products with no/low/
reduced calories, whole grains or other 

ingredients, generally recognized 

as healthier or in calorie-controlled 

packaging, accounted for over 70 

percent of their U.S. dollar sales growth. 
A follow-up study, commissioned by the 
HWCF, analyzed United States product 

and sales data for 16 member companies 

Š some of the biggest food and 

beverage corporations in the country Š 

covering the same period. It found that 

lower-calorie product sales grew more 

than $1.25 billion and accounted for 82 
percent of the combined sales growth 

over that period, increasing at more than 

four times the rate of higher-calorie fare.  

HWCF reported that the higher sales of 

lower-calorie items helped the member 

companies achieve a public commitment 

to reduce 1.5 trillion calories in food sold 

in the United States, three years ahead 

of schedule. An independent evaluation, 

which is supported by the Robert Wood 

Johnson Foundation, will examine 

whether that goal has been met and will 

be published later this year.A 2013 Hudson Institute study of the restaurant industry, Lower-Calorie 
Foods: It™s Just Good Business, found that 
restaurant chains that increased their 
lower-calorie servings from 2006 to 
2011 outperformed those that served 
fewer lower-calorie menu items. More pointedly, while servings of 
lower-calorie foods increased by 
almost a half billion over the ˜ve 
years, servings of higher-calorie foods 
declined sharply by 1.3 billion.These study results show that companies can do well by doing 
good and no longer need to choose 
between satisfying investors and 
helping address the nation™s most 
urgent public health crisis. Healthier, 
lower-calorie foods are selling well and 
an increasing number of Americans 
are demanding them. The companies 
that are already ˜lling this need are 
demonstrating a commitment not 
only to public health, but also to the 
well-being of their consumers and 
their bottom lines.Those companies that ignore this sea change will be missing out on the 
biggest business opportunity  
in decades. Hank Cardello is the author of ﬁStuffed: 
An Insider™s Look at Who™s (Really) 
Making America Fat.ﬂ68fasinfat.orgCOMPANIES THAT CAN FILL AMERICA™S GROWING DESIRE TO EAT BETTER ARE ALREADY BENEFITING. Chains that increased their lower-calorie servings saw a 5.5 percent 
increase in same-store sales, while 
those that did not suffered a 5.5 
percent decline.  The food and beverage industry spends nearly $2 billion 
annually marketing mostly unhealthy products to children 

and adolescents in America.146  Research shows that food 
and beverage marketing in˚uences the diets of young 

people.  Studies also link the marketing of energy-dense 

and nutrient-poor products to overweight and obesity.147  Black and Latino children and 
adolescents, who experience higher 

rates of overweight, obesity, and diet-
related chronic diseases, such as type 

2 diabetes, are exposed to higher 

levels of marketing for unhealthy food 

and beverage products.148, 149 Despite some progress to improve 

the nutritional quality of foods 

marketed to children at home, 

in schools and in restaurants, 

America™s youths continue to grow 

up in environments that promote 

unhealthy foods and beverages. 150F as in Fat: Obesity Policy SeriesFood MarketingCURRENT STATUS:FOOD MARKETINGAUGUST 2013 70In 2005, the Institute of Medicine 
recommended the food, beverage, 

and restaurant industries improve 

the health of their products 

and shift their advertising and 

marketing emphasis to healthier 

child- and youth-oriented foods 

and beverages.151  The IOM has 
since reaffirmed the need for 

stronger standards to improve food 

marketing practices that target 

young people. 152In 2006, food and beverage companies 
created the Children™s Food and 
Beverage Advertising Initiative 
(CFBAI), a self-regulatory program 
administered by the Council of Better 
Business Bureaus to limit unhealthy 
marketing aimed at children under 
12.  While the CFBAI has led to 
some reductions in unhealthy food 
marketing aimed at children, several 
studies show that the vast majority of 
marketed products remain unhealthy.  
Television advertising remains the 
dominant form of marketing to 
children and adolescents. However 
companies employ a variety of highly 
effective techniques to reach young 
people.  These include new digital 
and online media, such as online 
games, mobile apps and ads that 
can be shared via text messages, 
and social networks.  A 2012 report 
by the Federal Trade Commission 
showed that industry spending on 
digital media, such as online and viral 
marketing, increased 50 percent (or 
$45.9 million) from 2006 to 2009.154  Concern about the ineffectiveness of 
industry self-regulation led Congress 
in 2009 to direct the formation of an 
Interagency Working Group on Food 
Marketed to Children (IWG).  The 
group, composed of nutrition, health 
and marketing experts from the 
Federal Trade Commission, the Food 
and Drug Administration, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 
and the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, released a set of voluntary 
principles in 2011 to improve the 
nutritional pro˜le of foods marketed 
directly to children.  Through narrow marketing de˜nitions, loopholes in marketing types, 
and signi˜cant gaps in nutrition standards, the CFBAI nutrition 
criteria allow companies to continue to market foods and beverages 
high in calories, sodium, saturated fat and/or added sugars.153   71WHY FOOD MARKETING MATTERS:  The food and beverage industry spent $1.79 billion dollars in 2009 to advertise their products to American children and adolescents.    America™s youths view 12 to 16 food 
and beverage ads every day. 156  More than 2 billion ads for foods and 
beverages appeared on children™s websites in 2009, primarily for sugary cereals and fast-food restaurants.157    The vast majority of child-directed ads 
promote unhealthy foods and beverages, such as candy, sugary cereals, fries and sodas.  Ads for healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables, are extremely 
rare, accounting for just 1 percent or 
less of all ads.158   Black children saw more than twice the 
number of television ads for energy and sports drinks, and 93 percent more for regular soda compared with their 
White counterparts. Between 2008 and 2010, Hispanic children saw 49 percent more television ads and teens saw 99 
percent more ads on Spanish- language television for sugary drinks and energy drinks compared with their White 
counterparts.159  In an effort to address continued public health concern and scrutiny about food marketing, CFBAI unveiled a 
set of uniform standards in 2011 that are slated to be in 
place by January 1, 2014.  The uniform standards build on existing company-speci˜c criteria, but do not go as far as the IWG proposal.   Following the conclusion of a 
public comment period, Congress 
requested IWG to conduct a cost-bene˜t analysis of the proposed 

voluntary guidelines in 2012; 
to date, that analysis has not 
been completed, and no further 

progress has been made to 
implement the IWG proposal.15593% MORE!2 Billion!Black children™s exposure to advertising for

should strengthen and expand its self-regulatory 
program to cover all forms of marketing to all children, 
including product packaging, in-store promotions and all marketing in schools.  Media and entertainment companies should jointly adopt meaningful, uniform nutrition standards for 
marketing food and beverages to children.   Government agencies, researchers and independent 
groups should continue to monitor and evaluate 
food marketing expenditures and practices, as well as 
children™s exposure to marketing and advertising for unhealthy foods and beverages and the effectiveness of industry™s voluntary actions. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:Food and beverage marketing to children and adolescents: Limited progress by 2012, recommendations for the future Š full report.

 Corporate Irresponsibility: Junk Food Marketing to ChildrenIn a single day, a child may be given a soda-branded school

play a computer game featuring his or her favorite candy.

companies that pledged to reform their 

child-directed advertising practices 

to encourage healthier choices, 78 

percent of their ads for children on 

Spanish-language television are for 

unhealthy foods or drinks.  
Food and beverage companies also use sponsorship to expand the 
places they reach into communities 
of color. In addition to blanketing 
neighborhoods with billboards and 
signs outside corner stores, food 
marketers brand places like athletic 
˜elds and sporting events, festivals, 
concerts and awards shows.  These 
tactics integrate food companies and 
their products into the cultural and 
social fabric of people™s lives.In fact, soda and fast-food companies 

have been especially aggressive, 

sponsoring cultural events and including 

people of color in employment and 

in advertising before other companies 

ventured into those markets.This might be why research shows youth of color are more interested 
in, positive toward, and in˚uenced by 
marketing than their white peers. How can parents compete in an environment where the marketing 
campaign for a single candy bar

EACH DAY, AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN SEE TWICE AS MANY CALORIES ADVERTISED IN FAST-FOOD COMMERCIALS AS WHITE CHILDREN. THE MOST FREQUENTLY PROMOTED AND MOST ACCESSIBLE PRODUCTS TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE HIGH-CALORIE AND LOW-NUTRITION FOODS  AND BEVERAGES. 75fasinfat.orgAnd these tactics are accelerating 
thanks to the onslaught of digital 

marketing especially potent for

with messages promoting unhealthy 

foods and beverages.  Even their

delivering content marketing through

What can be done?  Responsibility begins 
with the food industry, which must 

strengthen its nutrition and marketing 

standards, including expanding the 

standards to cover all forms of marketing 

such as on packaging, sponsorships and 

toy giveaways.  
Kids today face an overall 
message environment that 
primarily promotes unhealthy

combined with sophisticated 
marketing strategies that 
disproportionately target them. 
 76fasinfat.orgEntertainment companies should do their part by

In public health, we must continue 
to monitor the latest forms of 

marketing and examine its effects 

on kids.  We need more research 

on the effects of brand advertising 

and content marketing on children 

and youth, especially youth of color, 

and we have to help parents better 

understand the harms of targeted 

advertising and the susceptibility of 

their children.  
And we have to share what we learn with 

the Federal Trade Commission and 

other government agencies that need to 

be equipped with the best science so they 

can take steps that protect children™s 

health.  Only then can we have any 

assurance that our kids Š especially 

kids of color Š can grow up in an 

environment that fosters healthy choices, 

not one that pits the good intentions of 

parents and advocates against the power 

and money of advertisers.  
 Americans consume approximately one-third of their total calories and spend half of their food budget eating 
away from home.160, 161  Few restaurants, however, display calorie information on menus or menu boards or make 
a complete set of nutrition information about their food 
and beverage options readily available to customers.  Over the past few years, some 
states and local communities have 

started to require larger chain food 

establishments to begin menu labeling. 

In addition, many leading health 

organizations, including the American 

Medical Association (AMA) and the 

American Heart Association, support 

menu labeling as an important health 

education tool to allow consumers to 

make informed choices.162  The AMA 
recommends providing consumers 

with nutrition information that is 

easy to understand and includes 
information about the total calories, 

fat, saturated fat, trans fat and sodium 

content of food items.163 According to the National Restaurant 
Association, ﬁMenu labeling has the 
potential to improve our nation™s 
health by allowing guests to make 
informed choices about the foods 
that are appropriate for their diet. 
This could ultimately contribute to 
the prevention and control of obesity, 
heart disease, cancer, diabetes and 
other nutrition-related conditions.ﬂ164F as in Fat: Obesity Policy SeriesMenu LabelingCURRENT STATUS:MENU LABELINGAUGUST 2013 78The Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, included a national requirement 
for all food establishments with 20 
or more locations, including chain 
restaurants, bakeries, grocery stores, 
convenience stores and coffee chains, 
to clearly post the calorie information 
for each standard item on their 
menus.  Companies with 20 or more 
food or beverage vending machines 
would have similar requirements.  In April 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued 
proposed rules and held a public comment period on new requirements 
for chain restaurants, similar retail 
food establishments and vending 
machines to include calorie counts on 
menu boards and to have additional 
nutrition information available upon 
request.  The federal rules would pre-
empt any existing state or local menu 
labeling regulations.The proposed rules provided speci˜c guidance for chain restaurants; 
however, FDA exempted movie 
theaters, airplanes, bowling alleys, 
stadiums and hotels, stating that their primary business is not to sell food.  
Nutrition labeling for alcohol also 
was exempted in the proposed rule.  
More than 80 national, state and local 
health organizations and experts 
called on the FDA to strengthen the 
˜nal rule and adhere to the language 
in the ACA by including outlets that 
sell food beyond chain restaurants, 
and to require labeling of alcoholic 
beverages listed on menus.As of July 20, 2013, the rule has not 
been finalized.  
  Eating out has increased dramatically over the past 40 years.  From 1977 to 78, Americans consumed about 18 percent of their calories eating out; now they consume approximately 30 percent of their daily calories outside of their homes.165  In 1970, families spent around 25 percent of their food budget at restaurants ($42.6 billion), now they spend around 48 percent of their food budget at restaurants ($631.8 billion).166  Research has shown that food eaten away from home is higher in 

fat and sodium, consumers routinely underestimate calories and 
fat when eating out, and children eat nearly double the number of 
calories when they eat out versus eating at home.167, 168, 169, 170, 171  Menu labeling can in˚uence consumer purchasing decisions, 
and market research by weight-management groups has shown some segments of the population are highly in˚uenced by this information. 172, 173  Menu labeling has prompted some restaurants to offer more 
healthful options or reformulate their current offerings.174  Researchers looking at the impact of menu labeling in 
Washington™s King County found that U.S. adults and teens who used calorie information posted on menus purchased up to 143 fewer calories than those who did not see the calories.175WHY MENU LABELING MATTERS:800 cal.18%25%30%48%1580 cal.Meal at Home% of Calories Eating Out 1977-78% of Calories Eating Out 2013Restaurant Meal% of Income Eating Out 1970% of Income Eating Out 2013 79  The Food and Drug Administration should issue ˜nal regulations for menu labeling for food establishments

 80fasinfat.orgCOMMENTARY FROM NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATIONBY JOAN MCGLOCKTON Vice President, Industry Affairs and Food Policy, National Restaurant AssociationNutrition information can be found on nearly every prepackaged food and beverage. The information on 
those ubiquitous labels is important for Americans, and   
more consumers are getting used to having access to nutrition information that can help them make informed decisions about what they eat and drink. Menu Labeling is Key to Empowering Consumers to 
Make Healthy ChoicesThe new menu labeling law sets 
a consistent, national standard 

for restaurants and similar retail 

food establishments, requiring 

these operations to provide certain 

nutrition information on menus 

and more information to those who 

request it. 
The law covers restaurants and 
similar retail food establishments 

that are part of a chain of 20 or more 

locations operating under one brand. 

That means that about 250,000 

restaurants across the country will 

be required to provide information 

about calorie counts, sodium, 

cholesterol and other information.  
The national standard comes after 
several states and cities moved to 

require chain restaurants to provide 

varying nutrition information. This 

presented a challenge for restaurant 
operators who operated in multiple 

states and had to comply with different 

regulations.  It was also confusing for 

consumers, who would visit a favorite 

restaurant in one state only to ˜nd the 

nutrition data presented differently in 

another state or city.The federal standard provides uniform nutrition information that 
restaurants operating in multiple 
states can implement nationwide. The 
new standard will override state and 
local laws that differ from the new 
federal standard. A national standard 
will ensure that diners from Portland, 
Ore., to Portland, Maine, have access 
to the same information Š and it 
spares restaurant companies that 
operate across multiple states the cost 
of producing separate menus or menu 
boards to comply with different state 
and local laws.  Tens of millions of Americans who 
eat in chain restaurants every day 
will soon have access to some of 
the same nutrition information 

available on prepackaged foods. 
 81So what will the new menu labeling look like in an actual restaurant? 
While the restaurant industry is 
still awaiting the release of the ˜nal 
standards by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), the draft 
standards released in 2011 gave some 
idea. Calorie counts will be available 
on menus, menu boards and drive-
thru displays, and restaurants will be 
required to provide other nutrition 
information on request. While the menu-labeling standard will 
no doubt present some challenges 

for restaurant operators, it also 

presents opportunities. A survey last 

year by the Association showed that 

75 percent of adults considered the 

availability of healthy menu items 

when choosing a quick-service or 

fast -food restaurant. Nearly three-
quarters of adults reported that they 

were trying to eat more healthfully 

than they did two years before. 
Many restaurants already post nutrition information about their meals online, and about 25 percent of adults report having looked up that online information, according to National Restaurant Association research. fasinfat.org 82fasinfat.orgThroughout the creation of the menu labeling standard, the National 
Restaurant Association has worked 
with Congress and now regulators 
to ensure that the new standards 
are ˚exible for restaurants, and 
that information is presented to consumers in a manner that is useful 
to them.  The foodservice industry 
is extraordinarily diverse, and a one-
size-˜ts-all approach to labeling will 
present challenges for the industry 
and consumers. Grocery stores and convenience 
stores are large and rapidly growing 
components of the away-from-home 
foodservice market in the United 
States.  According to the U.S. Census 
Bureau™s Economic Census, there are 
more than 114,000 grocery stores, 
convenience stores and gas stations 
offering freshly prepared food and 
beverages, with annual sales in excess 
of $20 billion. Taken together, these 
foodservice segments are nearly one-
quarter the size of the total number 
of full-service and limited-service 
restaurants in the United States.  The intent of the new law is to cover restaurant-type food. Excluding a 
signi˜cant portion of the foodservice industry Š just because the locations 
that sell restaurant-type foods get the 
majority of their sales from fuel or 
packaged goods Š will signi˜cantly 
limit the effectiveness of the law.    Over the past several years, consumers have shown an increased interest 
in healthful options at restaurants 
and restaurants have responded.  
Healthful children™s meals, locally 
grown produce and lower-calorie 
items are among the top restaurant 
trends this year. The menu-labeling law is the next step in empowering Americans to make 
choices that help them achieve their 
personal and health-related goals. FOR BOTH RESTAURANTS AND CONSUMERS, THE FDA WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANOTHER IMPORTANT DECISION: WHETHER THE STANDARDS 
COVER CONVENIENCE STORES AND GROCERY STORES THAT ARE RAPIDLY 
EXPANDING INTO RESTAURANT FOOD SALES.   Half of adults and nearly 72 percent of high school students in the United States do not meet the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention™s recommendations for 
physical activity, and American adults walk less than in any other industrialized country.176, 177, 178     Federal, state and local transportation 
policy impacts how all Americans move 

and has the potential to provide more 

opportunities for Americans to walk, 

bike and be more physically active.  

Research has shown that children and 

families are more active when they live 

in neighborhoods that have sidewalks, 

parks, bicycle lanes and safe streets.179  States and communities across the 

country are implementing policies to 

promote active transportation. For 

instance, 488 communities now have 

Complete Streets programs to support 

safe, accessible walking, biking, use 
 of public transportation and 

recreation spaces.F as in Fat: Obesity Policy SeriesMAP-21: Active Federal Transportation Policy and Obesity PreventionCURRENT STATUS:MAP-21: ACTIVE FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION POLICY AND OBESITY PREVENTIONAUGUST 2013 84WHY ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION MATTERS:  According to the National Academy of 
Sciences, a healthy built environment Š 
which includes having safe, accessible 
places to walk, bike or engage in other 

physical activity Š can facilitate physical 
activity.  They concluded a range of stud-ies show the built environment can be 

structured to give people more opportuni-ties and choices to be physically active.180 
  Children and teens living in neighborhoods 
with more green space, such as parks, 
playing ˜elds, trails and schoolyards, are 
less likely to be overweight than their coun-
terparts who live in neighborhoods with 
less green space.181  In general, states 
with the highest levels of bicycling and 

walking have the lowest levels of obesity, 
high blood pressure and diabetes, and 

have the greatest percentage of adults 
who meet the recommended 30 minutes 
or more a day of physical activity.182  In 1969, 89 percent of kindergarten 

through 8th grade students who lived 
within one mile of school usually walked 
or biked to school. By 2009, only 35 

percent of kindergarten through 8th 
grade students who lived within a mile of 
school usually walked or biked to school 

even once a week.183  Bridging the Gap, 
a nationally recognized research program 
funded by the Robert Wood Johnson 
Foundation,  found that laws requiring 

sidewalks, crossing guards and traf˜c 
safety measures increased the number of 
children walking or biking to school, and 

that certain laws, such as busing require-ments for particularly short distances, 
decreased biking and walking rates.184  According to the most recent National 
Household Travel Survey, just over 10 percent of all daily trips in the United States are made by walking.185  Percentage of trips in the United States 
made by walkingIn July 2012, President Obama signed a two-year extension of the federal 
surface transportation authorization, 
called the Moving Ahead for Progress 
in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21 
(P.L. 112-141).  MAP-21 reorganized Safe Routes to School, Recreational Trails and 
the Transportation Enhancement 
Program into a new entity called the 
Transportation Alternatives Program. 
Rather than a dedicated funding 
stream for each separate program, a 
single allocation will be divided for 
such purposes, and states now also may use a portion of these funds to 
support some road uses, such as basic 
repairs or maintenance projects.Funding for the Transportation Alternatives Program was authorized 
at $800 million annually, which 
represents a 33 percent cut from the 
$1.2 billion previously appropriated 
to the three individual programs.  
Interim guidance released by the 
U.S. Department of Transportation 
in October 2012 requires a new 
20 percent state or local match for 
any new Transportation Alternative 
Program projects.Percentage of K-8

Complete Streets programs and Safe Routes to School 
and other programs that make it easier and safer for 
children and adults to be active.  State and regional transportation planning, monitoring, 

and evaluation should incorporate health into all decision-

making, and federal transportation dollars should be tied 

to measurable health-improvement metrics and goals.Policy Recommendations: 86 TFAH  RWJF  fasinfat.orgSTATE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION LAWSSafe Routes to Schools  Safe Routes to School (SRTS) programs operate in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., bene˜ting 13,000 schools.  Every state and 
Washington, D.C., has an SRTS coordinator.SRTS was created by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation (DOT) to 

promote walking and biking to school.  
The program supports improving 
sidewalks, bike paths and safe street 

crossings; reducing speeds in schools 
zones and neighborhoods; addressing 
distracted driving; and educating people 

about pedestrian and bike safety.  
The program includes a range of 
partners, such as educators, parents, 

students, government of˜cials, city 
planners, business and community 
leaders, health of˜cials and members 

of the community.   Early studies of 
the program have shown a positive 
effect on active travel among children 

and a reduction in crashes involving 
pedestrians.186, 187, 188  While every state 
currently participates in some form of 
SRTS activities, implementation and 
funding support varies.Complete Streets Programs  Twenty-eight states and D.C. 
have adopted Complete Streets programs:  California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, 
Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New 
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, 
Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.  Complete Streets programs encourage physical activity and green 
transportation, walking and cycling, and building or protecting urban transport systems that are fuel-
ef˜cient, space-saving and promote healthy lifestyles. 87fasinfat.orgOver the last decade or so, research has continually 
demonstrated how the ﬁbuilt environmentﬂ Š the layout 

and design of buildings, streets, sidewalks and other 

infrastructure Š affects health. Since the 1950s, we have 
built most of our neighborhoods and cities in a way that 
accommodates increasing levels of traf˜c at the cost of 

discouraging physical activity. 
Studies have correlated time spent in traf˜c with extra weight gain and 
lower physical activity, while the 
rapid transformation of the built 
environment has posed an increasing 
danger to pedestrians.  Two-thirds of 
pedestrian fatalities occur on bigger ﬁarterialﬂ roads, the wide, multi-lane 
thoroughfares lined with shopping 
centers, apartment complexes and 
of˜ce parks.  Many of the victims are 
seniors, recent immigrants or people 
struggling to make ends meet. EXPERT COMMENTARYBY JAMES CORLESS, Director, Transportation for AmericaBold Reforms Needed for Federal Transportation Policy  88fasinfat.orgDESPITE THE OBSTACLES OF A BUILT ENVIRONMENT THAT Š INTENTIONALLY 
OR NOT Š INHIBITS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, OVER THE LAST DECADE WE HAVE SEEN A TREMENDOUS UPSURGE IN AMERICANS™ DESIRE TO WALK AND BICYCLE, WHETHER FOR COMMUTING OR RECREATION. 
Communities of all sizes, in all regions of the country, have built new 
sidewalks, multi-use trails and bike 
lanes, many as part of a ﬁcomplete 
streetsﬂ policy that calls for safely 
accommodating all users of urban 
and suburban roads. Developers have 
found that residents are ˚ocking to 
new neighborhoods designed to be 
walkable, and new real estate tools 
such as WalkScore.com, which rates neighborhood walkability, have arisen 
to help people ˜nd them. Bike-share 
systems providing short-term, point-
to-point bicycle rentals are operating 
or planned in more than a dozen 
major cities, and growing numbers of 
people are walking or biking to public 
transportation. In short, if you build 
infrastructure that is safe and inviting, 
many people will use it, and they will 
be more active and healthier.  89fasinfat.orgIn the summer of 2012 Congress reauthorized the surface transportation law now known as Moving Ahead for 
Progress in the 21st century, or MAP-21, which included 
some notable changes to federal transportation programs:  MAP-21 consolidated Safe Routes to Schools, Recreational Trails and 
Transportation Enhancements into 
one Transportation Alternatives 
Program. There is no longer 
dedicated funding for each separate 
program, but a single allocation to 
divide among all three, with a third 
less funding overall. In addition, 
states can now use a portion of 
these funds to support some road 
uses, leaving even less funding for 
the projects that support active 
transportation.   While state DOTs previously 

controlled the funding for active 

transportation, a new provision gives 

more local control to communities to 

make their streets safer for walking 

or biking. About half the funding 

in the Transportation Alternatives 

Program will be given directly 

to metropolitan areas, with the 

remainder used at state discretion. 

Local leaders interested in creating 
more walkable neighborhoods and 

better infrastructure for public 

transportation need to secure 

matching grants from a federal 

partner to get their projects funded. 
  A new grant program will fund 
community-led planning for 
neighborhood revitalization around 
transit lines. Research has shown 
that making mass transit more 
accessible promotes physical activity, 
as people generally walk to and from 
the subway or bus lines.   T
he law provides a new framework for measuring and improving 
transportation performance. 
Accountability under this structure 
will largely need to come from 
the public to ensure that the U.S. 
Department of Transportation sets 
the right performance measures and 
that states, metro regions and transit 
authorities all set aggressive targets 
that guide investment decisions.What should the future of federal 
transportation policy look like? 
With federal gas tax revenues 
declining, the U.S. population 

growing and the existing system 
showing its age, it is clear that 
bolder reforms and additional 

funding will be necessary within 
the next few years. 90fasinfat.orgOther factors also argue for a more forward-looking approach: Gas 
prices are trending ever upward, and 
demand for public transportation 
is booming like never before. 
Demographic shifts show a more 
diverse America with fewer young 
people driving and huge increases 
in demand for more walkable towns 
and suburbs. More and more people 
are clamoring for safer streets and 
healthier communities.States and localities should be 
encouraged to ensure transportation 
funding that is forward-looking 
and re˚ects the priorities of rapidly 
changing demographics Š such as 
seniors trying to get to the doctor, 
millenials looking for more vibrant 
neighborhoods and transportation 
options, low-income workers trying to 
get to jobs, and kids simply trying to 
cross the street to get to school or to a 
park to play.The goals of federal transportation policy must be to guarantee 
the nation™s freedom to move Š however we choose Š and to 
lead to a stronger economy, greater energy security, a cleaner 
environment and a healthier America. 
People have shown, repeatedly, that they want well-maintained 
infrastructure and access to a variety 
of transportation options and safe places to walk and exercise in their 
communities. Federal, state and local 
policies should re˚ect and support 
these desires.  Traditionally, care inside the doctor™s of˜ce and support to help people follow their doctors™ advice in their daily 
lives have operated separately.  And, public and private 
insurers have typically focused on reimbursing activities that happen directly within a healthcare setting.  However, there is growing evidence that Americans cannot achieve health 
goals and effectively follow their 
doctors™ advice without support in 
their daily lives Š in neighborhoods, 
workplaces and schools.The Affordable Care Act calls 
for increased attention to obesity 
prevention and control at the doctor™s 
of˜ce and provides new opportunities 
for insurers to expand coverage for 
proven community-based programs 
outside the clinical setting.F as in Fat: Obesity Policy SeriesObesity Prevention  Inside and Outside the Doctor™s Of˜ceCURRENT STATUS:OBESITY PREVENTION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE DOCTOR™S OFFICEAUGUST 2013 92WHY BETTER INTEGRATION OF MEDICAL CARE AND SUPPORT WHERE PEOPLE LIVE, LEARN, WORK AND PLAY MATTERS:  To maximize effectiveness, providers and 
insurers, including state Medicaid pro-grams, can take an integrated approach 
to include community-based prevention 

and public health to provide support for 
patients to be able to follow doctors™ 
advice in their daily lives.  For instance, 

a new model that created an Affordable 
Care Community (ACC) in Akron, Ohio, 
involves a coordinated clinical-community 

prevention approach and has reduced 
the average cost per month of care for 
individuals with type 2 diabetes by more 

than 10 percent per month over 18 
months. A second project, a diabetes 
self-management program, resulted in 

estimated program savings of $3,185 
per person per year.  This initiative also 
led to a decrease in diabetes-related 

emergency department visits.  Efforts such as the National Diabetes Pre-
vention Program (DPP) that help provide 
support to allow patients to follow doctors™ 
advice in their daily lives, are showing 

results in improving health and bringing 
down costs.  Participants in the YMCA™s 
DPP lost an average of 4.8 percent of 

their body weight, with some participants 
losing up to 7 percent of body weight.  NIH 
studies have shown this to be suf˜cient 

change to prevent the onset of diabetes.  The American Heart Association 
published a review of more than 200 studies and concluded that most cardiovascular disease could be 
prevented or at least delayed until old age through a combination of direct medical care and community-based 
prevention programs and policies.190Average body weight

participants 
  T
he ACA requires new plans 
from private and self-insurers 
and Medicare to cover the most 

bene˜cial and cost-effective 

prevention services without co-
payments.  This gives doctors 

increased ability to provide obesity 

screening and counseling to patients.  

Incentives are provided to encourage 

state Medicaid programs to cover 

more preventive services.  However, 

nearly half of all Americans currently 

do not access many commonly 

recommended preventive services.189 
  O
utdated regulations and billing 
systems have constrained insurers 

from paying for programs that are 

not directly delivered by doctors 
and licensed medical providers, or 

that help support the health of an 

entire neighborhood rather than 

focusing on a speci˜c individual 

who is tied to a speci˜c billing code.  

Recently, a few private insurers have 

begun covering some evidence-based 

community prevention programs, but 

these efforts are limited.  In addition, 

in 2013, the Centers for Medicare 

and Medicaid Services (CMS) took 

a ˜rst step with a proposed rule that 

would give states greater ˚exibility in 

what kinds of prevention programs 

they cover, such as for obesity 

education and counseling activities. 

CMS has not ˜nalized this rule or 

provided best practices or speci˜c 

examples to states.Average monthly savings that individuals with type 2 diabetes achieve with preventive care 10%$3,185per personper year4.8% - 7% 93Policy Recommendations:  New health system approaches, including Accountable 
Care Organizations and other approaches to organizing 

and ˜nancing healthcare, must incorporate community 

obesity-prevention programs to be successful in reaching 
goals to improve health and lower costs. Accountable Care 
Organizations are groups of health care providers that pri-
oritize coordinated care and quality goals to achieve overall 

health for their patients while reducing health care costs.  Government and private insurers should implement 
policies and programs to increase the use of preventive 
services, particularly among communities where services 
are underutilized.  Medicaid should expand coverage of community 

prevention programs, including moving forward on 

regulations to allow states to reimburse a broader array of 

health providers and entities and pay for additional services.  Medicaid should identify and disseminate community 
prevention best practices by Medicaid programs.  Private insurance coverage should incentivize 
coordinated clinical and community care, and expand coverage of community prevention programs.ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:Transforming Health By Developing an Accountable Care Community.  J. Janosky.

 TO HELP CONNECT INDIVIDUALS WITH COMMUNITY RESOURCES, WE LAUNCHED THE IOWA COMMUNITY REFERRAL PROJECT SO IOWANS WILL STAY HEALTHIER LONGER AND DELAY OR AVOID SERIOUS NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES.Connecting Care Inside and 
Outside the Doctor™s Of˜ce in IowaRight now, 30.4 percent of adults and 13.6 percent of 
children in Iowa are obese.  According to the 2012 F 
as in Fat report, if things continue on their current 

course, the state™s obesity rates could climb to 54.4 
percent by 2030.  
Currently, nearly 30 percent of Iowa 
adults have hypertension and 9.7 

percent have diabetes.  If we don™t take 

action, in the next 20 years, we could 

see the number of new cases of type 

2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke, 

hypertension, arthritis, obesity-related 

cancer and other diseases continue 

to rise, and obesity-related healthcare 

costs could grow by 3.7 percent.iWe™ve decided it™s time to do things 
differently.  One thing that has never 
made sense is the disconnect between 
the care patients receive in the 
doctor™s of˜ce and the lack of support 
there is in communities to be able to 
follow the doctor™s advice in daily life.   
This is particularly important for 
obesity and related health conditions.  

For instance, a doctor ˜nds a patient 
has prediabetes.  Unfortunately, there 
is no special pill to prescribe as a cure, 
but, rather, the prescription is making 
better decisions about nutrition and 
being more physically active.  To 
make the connection between the 
clinical setting and daily life, Iowa™s 
local Community Transformation 
Grant (CTG) projects are making it 
easier for people who want to follow 
the doctor™s orders to do so in their 
community by creating environments 
that support access to healthy foods 
and physical activity.94fasinfat.orgEXPERT COMMENTARYBY KALA SHIPLEY, Executive Director, Health Promotion Œ Division of Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention, Iowa Department of HealthﬁObesity is already taking a 
serious health and economic toll on the state.ﬂ   We™ve partnered the Iowa Primary Care 
Association (IPCA) and Local Boards 

of Health so that doctors will now have 

access and information about programs 

in communities, and will be able to 

refer and match their patients to those 

resources.  As part of our CTG, we are 

bringing together partners, including 

medical providers, local departments 
of public health, community groups 

and others to identify evidence-based 

programs and efforts. 
Now, doctors in many counties will 
have the information they need to 

connect their patients with effective 

programs.  In essence, the prediabetic 

patient will be able to receive a referral 

from their doctor to programs in their 
community that can help them get 

healthier and potentially avoid devel-
oping diabetes.  The Community Re-
ferral Project connects individuals to 

the entire spectrum of care Š provid-
ing patients with better opportunities 

to follow their doctor™s advice, whether 

it be healthy eating, increased physical 

activity or something else.    
EXAMPLES OF SOME TYPES OF PROGRAMS INCLUDE:  The Black Hawk County Board of Health has built a referral system that connects members of the community with healthy choices and better chronic disease self-
management. The evidence-based Stan-ford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program helps manage chronic condi-
tions such as diabetes or prediabetes by empowering individuals to set person-alized goals for health improvement. At 
the Aging and Disability Resource Center serving Iowans in Black Hawk County and the Hawkeye Valley Area, counsel-
ors help seniors ˜nd practical ways to self-manage their condition, starting with understanding the health, mobility and 
physical activity levels of individuals and making referrals to community programs such as the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management classes, exercise 
classes, farmer™s markets and disability resources.  As part of the recently upgraded electronic 
medical record system in Decatur County, 
physicians can now give patients an ﬁex-ercise prescription,ﬂ which can include 

information about ways to increase physi-cal activity and connect people with ˜tness 
centers and exercise programs.  In Polk County, medical clinics, the 
YMCA Health Living Center and the county health department are work-ing together to connect patients with 
the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program.  Physicians at Mercy Medical Centers refer patients 
with chronic health conditions, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol, to health coaches at the hospital and wellness coaches at the YMCA who work 
with individuals and hold workshops to improve their health.   In Dallas County, the county health de-partment has built a referral system with 
county Mercy Medical clinics that par-ticipate in the Iowa Medicaid Enterprise 

(IME) Health Home program.  The clinics 
now regularly refer patients to a Health 
Navigation program run by the county 

health department, which connects them 
with local services including housing as-sistance, food assistance, enrolling in 

public programs, medication assistance, 
behavioral health, wellness options and 
other programs.  
95fasinfat.org One of the objectives of the CTG is to reduce obesity by 5 percent.  We believe this project is one important piece 
in helping to reach that goal.  By creating more overt and 
direct connections between care in the doctor™s of˜ce with opportunities to be healthier in daily life, we can achieve better results. Last year™s F as in Fat report demon-strated the impact these types of changes 

can have.  If we reduce the average body 

mass index (BMI) of adults in the state, 

we could reduce healthcare spending 

by more than $2 billion in 10 years and 

$5.7 billion in 20 years, while helping 

thousands of Iowans from developing 

preventable diseases.iiBy better coordinating care for those 

who have obesity-related illnesses, we 
can prevent situations from getting 

worse Š for instance, stopping 

people with pre-diabetes from 

developing type II diabetes Š and 

save lives and money. 
It™s time we involve the whole healthcare system in preventing 
diseases and keeping us all healthier, 
rather than just treating conditions 
after they have already happened. 96fasinfat.orgi  T

ii  Ibid OBESITY AND HEALTH Type 2 Diabetes  More than 25 million adult Americans have diabetes.191  Another 79 million Americans are pre-
diabetic, which means they have pro-longed or uncontrolled elevated blood sugar levels that can contribute to the 
development of diabetes.192 CDC proj-ects that as many as one in three U.S. adults could have diabetes by 2050.193  Approximately 215,000 individuals under the age of 20 have diabetes and two million adolescents ages 12 to 19 have pre-diabetes. 194, 195  Compared with non-Hispanic white 
adults, the risk of diagnosed diabetes is 18 percent higher among Asian Ameri-cans, 66 percent higher among Hispan-
ics/Latinos, and 77 percent higher among non-Hispanic blacks.  Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of 
death in the United States and accounts 
for $245 billion in total U.S. healthcare 
costs annually.196, 197  Diabetes accounts 
for more than one in ˜ve U.S. healthcare 
dollars, and healthcare costs for individu-als with diagnosed diabetes are approxi-
mately 2.3 times higher than costs for 
those without diabetes.  More than 80 percent of people with dia-betes are overweight.198  The National Institute of Diabetes and 
Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) found that a 7 percent weight loss to-gether with moderate levels of physical 
activity (walking 30 minutes a day, ˜ve days a week) decreased the number of new diabetes cases by 58 percent among people at risk for diabetes.199Heart Disease and Stroke  One in four Americans has some form of 
cardiovascular disease.200  One in three adults has high blood pres-
sure, and high blood pressure is the 
leading cause of stroke.  Approximately 
30 percent of cases of hypertension 

may be attributable to obesity, and the 
˜gure may be as high as 60 percent in 
men under 45.201  Heart disease is the leading cause of 
death in the United States, and stroke is the fourth leading cause.202    People who are overweight are more likely to have high blood pressure, high levels of blood fats, and high LDL (bad cholesterol), which are all risk factors 
for heart disease and stroke.203  Physically inactive people are twice as 
likely to develop coronary heart disease compared with regularly active people.204Cancer  Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States.205  Approximately 20 percent of cancer 
cases among women and 15 percent of cancer cases among men is attributable to obesity.206  Obesity increases risk for endometrial 

(uterine) cancer by 39 percent, esopha-geal cancer by 37 percent, kidney cancer 
by 25 percent, colon cancer by 11 percent 

and post-menopausal cancer by 9 percent.F as in Fat: Appendix AFast Facts about ObesityAPPENDIX A:  FAST FACTS ABOUT OBESITYAUGUST 2013 98  Physical activity can reduce a person™s risk for a number of types of cancer, including colon cancer by 30 percent to 40 percent, breast cancer by at least 20

nearly 100,000 cases of breast and colon 
cancer each year in the United States.208Neurological and Psychiatric Diseases  Both overweight and obesity at midlife independently increase the risk of de-mentia, Alzheimer™s disease and vascu-lar dementia. 209, 210  An analysis of data from a health survey 
of more than 40,000 Americans found a correlation between depression and obe-sity.  Obese adults were more likely to

obese (BMI ˝ 40).212Kidney Disease  Obese individuals (BMI ˝ 30) are 83 
percent more likely to develop kidney disease than normal-weight individuals (18.5<BMI<25), while overweight indi-
viduals (25< BMI<30) are 40 percent more likely to develop kidney disease.213   In the United States, an estimated 24.2 percent of kidney disease cases among men and 33.9 percent of cases among women are related to overweight and 
obesity.214Liver Disease  Obese individuals are at greater risk of 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a liver disease which can lead to cirrhosis, in which the liver is permanently dam-
aged and no longer able to work prop-erly.  NASH is one of the major causes of cirrhosis in America, behind only hep-
atitis C and alcoholic liver disease. 215Arthritis  Obesity is a known risk factor for the 

development and progression of osteoar-thritis of the knee and possibly of other 
joints.  Obese adults are up to four times 

more likely to develop osteoarthritis of 
the knee than healthy-weight adults.216  68.8 percent of individuals diagnosed with arthritis are overweight or obese.217  For every pound of body weight lost, 

there is a 4 percent reduction in knee 
joint stress among overweight and obese 
people with osteoarthritis of the knee.218 
  Adults with arthritis are signi˜cantly 

less likely to participate in leisure time 
physical activity compared to those 
without arthritis.219HIV/AIDS  Antiretroviral treatments are less ef-fective for obese patients.  One study found that obese individuals had signi˜-cantly smaller gains in CD4 cell count 
after starting HIV treatment than both patients of normal weight and those who were overweight.220 99Obesity and Children™s Health  More than one third of children and ado-lescents are overweight or obese.221  The number of fat cells a person has is de-
termined by late adolescence; although over-weight and obese children can lose weight, 
they do not lose the extra fat cells.222  Obese adolescents are more likely to be-
come obese adults. A retrospective study 
found that as BMI increased in adoles-cence the probability of obesity as an adult 

signi˜cantly increased as wellŠobese 
male youths were 18 times more likely to 
become obese adults and obese female 

youths were 49 times more likely to be-come obese adults.223 About 70 percent of 
obese youths have at least one additional 

risk factor for cardiovascular disease, such 
as elevated total cholesterol, triglycerides, 

insulin or blood pressure.224  Nearly 40 percent have two or more 
additional risk factors.225  At least one out of every ˜ve U.S. teen-
agers has abnormal cholesterol levels, a major risk factor for heart disease.226    Among obese teenagers, the rate jumped to more than two out of ˜ve (43 percent.)227   Overweight and obesity are associated 
with a 52 percent increased risk of a new 
diagnosis of asthma among children and 
adolescents.228  The majority of studies 
included in a systematic review of the rela-tionship between obesity and asthma from 
1966 through 2011 support a positive 

association between obesity and asthma 
in children. The review found that gender 
was the most prominent effect modi-
˜er, with obese girls more likely to have 
asthma diagnoses than obese boys.229  Children and adolescents with a BMI 
greater than 28 are four to ˜ve times more 
likely to experience sleep-disordered breath-ing than their peers with a lower BMI.230Maternal Health and Obesity  There is a growing body of evidence 
documenting the links between maternal health conditions, including obesity and chronic diseases, and increased risks 
before, during and after childbirth.231    Children born to obese mothers are 
twice as likely to be obese and to de-velop type 2 diabetes later in life.232  Teenage mothers who are obese before pregnancy are four times more likely than their healthy-weight counterparts to develop gestational diabetes, a form 
of diabetes that arises during pregnancy and increases a woman™s risk of devel-oping type 2 diabetes later on.233  CDC and the Kaiser Permanente 
Northwest Center for Health Research found that obesity during pregnancy is associated with an increased use of 
healthcare services and longer hospi-tal stays.234  The study of more than 13,000 pregnancies found that obese 
women required more outpatient medi-cations, were given more obstetrical 
ultrasounds, and were less likely to see nurse midwives or nurse practitioners in favor of physicians.  Cesarean delivery 
rates were 45.2 percent for extremely obese women, compared with 21.3 percent for healthy-weight women.235  Cesarean deliveries have higher heath risks and higher medical costs. 100Economic Costs of ObesityHealthcare Costs  Obesity-related medical treatment costs between $147 and $210 billion a year, or nearly 10 percent of all an-nual medical spending (based on 2006 
data).  The majority of the spending is generated from treating obesity-related diseases such as diabetes.236  Of the $147 billion, Medicare and 
Medicaid are responsible for $61.8 billion.  Medicare and Medicaid spend-ing would be 8.5 percent and 11.8 
percent lower, respectively, in the ab-sence of obesity.237  Obese people spend 42 percent more on healthcare costs than healthy-weight people.238  Childhood obesity alone is responsible for $14.1 billion in direct costs.239   Annually, the average total health ex-
penses for a child treated for obesity under Medicaid is $6,730, while the av-erage health cost for all children covered 
by Medicaid is $2,446. The average total health expenses for a child treated for obesity under private insurance is 
$3,743, while the average health cost for all children covered by private insur-ance is $1,108.240  Hospitalizations of children and youths 
with a diagnosis of obesity nearly doubled between 1999 and 2005, while total costs for children and youths 
with obesity-related hospitalizations increased from $125.9 million in 2001 to $237.6 million in 2005, measured in 
2005 dollars.241  In California alone, the economic costs 

of overweight, obesity and physical 
inactivity are estimated to cost $41 bil-lion a year.242Decreased Worker Productivity and Increased Absenteeism  Obesity-related job absenteeism costs $4.3 billion annually.243  Obesity is associated with lower pro-
ductivity while at work (presenteeism), which costs employers $506 per obese worker per year.244  As a person™s BMI increases, so do the 
number of sick days, medical claims and healthcare costs associated with that person.245Higher Workers™ Compensation Claims  A number of studies have shown obese workers have higher workers™ compensa-tion claims.246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251   Obese employees had $51,091 in medical claims costs per 100 full-time employees, costs for medical claims for healthy-weight workers was $7,503. And 
obese workers had $59,178 in indem-nity claims costs per 100 full-time em-ployees; healthy-weight indemnity claims 
cost $5,396.252Health and Emergency Safety Costs  Emergency responders and healthcare 
providers face unique challenges in transporting and treating the heaviest patients.  According to one study, the 
number of severely obese (BMI ˝ 40) patients quadrupled between 1986 and 2000 from one in 200 to one in 50.  
The number of super-obese (BMI ˝ 50) patients grew by a factor of ˜ve, from one in 2,000 to one in 400.253    A typical ambulance out˜tted with 
equipment and two emergency medical technicians (EMTs) that can transport a 400-pound patient costs $70,000.  A 
specially out˜tted bariatric ambulance that can transport patients weighing up to 1,000 pounds costs $110,000.254  A standard hospital bed can hold 500 
pounds and costs $1,000.  A bariatric hospital bed that can hold up to 1,000 pounds costs $4,000.255   101MANY FACTORS INFLUENCE NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITYFood Choices and Changes  Prices for many less nutritious foods 
and content have declined signi˜cantly, 
and there is a much wider availability 
of less nutritious foods available.256  Increases in caloric intake; adults con-
sumed approximately 300 more calo-ries daily in the past 30 years.257  Limited access to supermarkets and nu-tritious, fresh foods in many urban, rural 
and lower-income neighborhoods.258 
  ﬁPortion distortion,ﬂ or the rise of bigger portions.  ﬁValue sizingﬂ or placing a higher 
value on the amount of food versus the quality of food.259  Less in-home cooking and more fre-quent reliance on takeout food and eating in restaurants.Schools   Marketing of unhealthy foods and bev-erages in schools.  Increased availability of low-nutrition 

foods and beverages in à la carte lines, 
school stores, vending machines and at 
fundraisers and classroom parties.260  Reduction in the amount of physical edu-
cation (PE), recess and recreation time.  Fewer safe routes to school that en-
courage kids to walk and bike.  Limited opportunities for health educa-
tion that includes health topics on nu-trition and physical activity and ˜tness.Community Design  Communities designed to foster driv-ing rather than walking or biking.  Lack of public transportation options.  No sidewalks or poor upkeep of side-
walk infrastructure.  Walking areas often unsafe or 
inconvenient.  Limited park and recreation space, 
including indoor facilities.  Poor upkeep and security in local parks.  Lack of affordable indoor physical 
activity options.  Retail and employment centers sepa-
rated from housing.  Zoning codes prohibit many smart 
growth strategies that would create more opportunities for physical activity and increase access to healthy foods.Marketing and Advertising  More advertising and marketing of un-
healthy foods, particularly to kids.  Newer forms of marketing to kids, 
including online promotions and text messaging, which take place out of the view of parents.  Marketing of extreme or fad weight 
loss programs.Many Workplaces Not Conducive to Supporting Healthy Nutrition and 
Physical Activity  Many desk jobs limit or discourage physical activity and become part of the sedentary lifestyle.  Worksites typically not designed to foster movement.  Limited opportunities for physical ac-
tivity or recreation during the workday.  Unhealthy options in cafeterias or 
work lunch sites.  Lack of bike racks and/or shower 
facilities that discourage active transportation.  Lack of support for breast-feeding mothers.Economic Constraints  Health insurance coverage for obesity-
prevention services often has been limited or unavailable.  Lack of either appropriate preventive services or follow-up care for people without health insurance.   Expense, including taxes, of gym memberships, exercise classes, equipment, facility use and sports league fees.  Fewer and smaller grocery stores in 
lower-income neighborhoods, which often means residents have less ac-cess to affordable fruits and vegeta-
bles in lower-income neighborhoods.Family and Home In˚uences  In˚uence of other family members™ 

habits on eating and exercise patterns.  ﬁElectronic cultureﬂ options for enter-
tainment and free time, including TV, video games, and the Internet.  More people working outside the home or far from home.  Insuf˜cient amount of sleep.Limited Time  Long work hours lead to more meals, 
many of them high in calories, eaten outside the home.  Car time and commuting cut into free time 
that could be used for physical activity. 102TRENDS IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITYAdults  The World Health Organization es-timates that 1.9 million deaths 
worldwide are attributable to physical 
inactivity.  Chronic diseases associated 

with physical inactivity include cancer, 
diabetes and coronary heart disease.261  Four out of ˜ve U.S. adults are not meeting both the aerobic and muscle strengthening components of the federal government™s physical activity 
guidelines.262  Sixty percent of adults are not suf˜ciently 

active to achieve health bene˜ts.263  A study of more than 30,000 healthy 
adult U.S. women found that middle-aged women need at least an hour of moderate activity a day to maintain 
a healthy weight without restricting calories.264    For those middle-aged women who are already overweight (which includes most American women), even more exercise is recom-
mended to avoid gaining weight without eating less.265  Physical activity is signi˜cantly as-sociated with better survival and 
function among the very old (age ˝ 
85 years).266  
  Sedentary adults pay $1,500 more 
per year in healthcare costs than physically active adults.267    Studies suggest that moderate-to-high levels of physical activity substantially reduce, or even eliminate, the mortal-ity risk of obesity.268  Non-leisure time physical activity has 
decreased substantially in the past 20 to 30 years due to increasing mecha-nization at work and at home.269    ﬁNon-leisure time physical activ-
ityﬂ is de˜ned as energy spent in 
a normal day outside of sports, 
exercise and recreation.  This 

includes manual labor on the job, 
walking and biking to work and 
household chores.270  A majority of U.S. adults ages 20 to 
74 walk less than two to three hours per week and accumulate less than 5,000 steps per day.271  U.S. physical activity guidelines call for adults to walk 10,000 steps daily.  The automobile has signi˜cantly re-duced physical activity by its frequent use for short trips for shopping, going to the cleaners and other errands, 
and taking children to school.272  Youths  Current studies show that most 

youths do not meet physical activ-ity guidelines which recommend 
engaging in 60 minutes or more of 

moderate-to-vigorous physical activity 
per day. 273, 274  Only 42 percent of children ages 6 to 11 engage in 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ˜ve or more days per week.275   That ˜gure drops to 8 percent for 
adolescents ages 12 to 15 and to 7.6 percent for adolescents ages 16 to 19.276  An analysis of accelerometer data for 
children and adults shows that the amount of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity plummets as 
children reach adolescence.277  The number of children walking to and 
from school has declined dramatically over the past 40 years, from 47.7 percent of students in 1969 to 12.7 
percent of students in 2009.278  There is substantial evidence that 
physical activity has a positive effect on students™ academic performance, including grades and standardized 
test scores, according to a review of 50 studies conducted by CDC.279  Young children are generally not physically active while in early child education programs:  an estimated 70 percent to 87 percent of children™s 
time in early child education is spent being sedentary (sitting or lying down), and less than 3 percent may be spent 
engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.280, 281 103AMERICANS™ EATING HABITSThe USDA reports that to meet the Di-etary Guidelines for Americans, people would need to substantially lower their intake of added fats, re˜ned grains, 
sodium, along with added sugars and sweeteners, and increase their con-sumption of fruits, vegetables, whole 
grains and low-fat milk and milk prod-ucts.282  Some American eating habits over the past few decades include:More CaloriesAmericans™ mean energy intake of calo-ries increased from 1955  per day during 
1971 to 1975 to 2269 per day  in 2003 
to 2004 Š more than a 300 calorie 

increase.  It then  declined to 2195 calo-ries per day during 2009 to 2010.283  Children ages 2 to 18 consume al-most three snacks a day, and snack-ing accounted for up to 27 percent of children™s daily caloric intake.284  Recently, however, caloric intake for 

all boys and girls began to decrease 
from 1999 to 2000 to 2009 to 2010.  
Boys aged 2 to 19 decreased from 

2,258 to 2,100 and girls aged 2 to 19 
decreased from 1,831 to 1,755.285Bigger Portion Sizes  From 1977 to 1998, portion sizes for 
selected popular food items and over-all energy intake increased for foods 
purchased in restaurants or fast-food 
establishments and for foods prepared 
at home.  The increase ranged from 49 
to 133 calories for all selected popular 

foods, such as salty snacks, hamburg-ers, soft drinks and french fries.286More Sugar  Sugar consumption has decreased from about 100g per day to 76.6 grams per day from 1999 to 2000 to 2007 to 2008, but consumption is 
still nearly two times the USDA recom-mended intake.287   Sugar-sweetened beverages make up nearly 16 percent of children ages 12-19 total caloric consumption.288More Dietary Fat  Americans consumed an average of 640 calories worth of added fats per person per day in 2008.289A Major Increase in Eating Out  63 percent of children ages 1 to 12 ate out at a restaurant one to three times per week.290  Adults consume an average of 11.3 
percent of their total daily calories from 
fast food.  Obese adult consumed 
13.2 percent of their calories from 

fast food, while overweight individuals 
consumed 11.2 percent and normal or 
underweight adults consumed 9.2 per-
cent of calories from fast food.291 F as in Fat: Appendix BAPPENDIX B:  METHODOLOGYAUGUST 2013Methodology for Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System for Obesity, Physical 
Activity, and Fruit and Vegetable 
Consumption RatesMethodology for Obesity and Other Rates Using BRFSSAnnual DataData for this analysis was obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset (publicly avail-able on the web at www.cdc.gov/brfss).  
The data were reviewed and analyzed for TFAH and RWJF by Daniel Eisenberg, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Health Man-
agement and Policy at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional survey designed to measure behavioral risk fac-
tors in the adult population (18 years of age or older) living in households. Data are collected from a random sample of 
adults (one per household) through a telephone survey. The BRFSS currently includes data from 50 states, the District 
of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. Variables of interest included BMI, 
physical inactivity and diabetes. BMI 

was calculated by dividing self-reported 
weight in kilograms by the square of self-reported height in meters. The variable 

‚obesity™ is the percentage of all adults 
in a given state who were classi˜ed as 
obese (where obesity is de˜ned as BMI 

greater than or equal to 30). Researchers 
also provide results broken down by 
ageŠresearchers report results for 18 
to 25 year olds, 26 to 44 year olds, 45 

to 64 year olds and 65 and older Œ and 
gender. Another variable ‚overweight™ 
was created to capture the percentage of 

adults in a given state who were either 
overweight or obese. An overweight adult 
was de˜ned as one with a BMI greater 

than or equal to 25 but less than 30. For 
the physical inactivity variable a binary 
indicator equal to one was created for 

adults who reported not engaging in 
physical activity or exercise during the 
previous thirty days other than their 

regular job. For diabetes, researchers 
created a binary variable equal to one if 
the respondent reported ever being told 

by a doctor that he/she had diabetes. 
Researchers excluded all cases of 
gestational and borderline diabetes as 

well as all cases where the individual was 
either unsure, or refused to answer. 
To calculate prevalence rates for hyper-tension, researchers created a dummy 
variable equal to one if the respondent answered ﬁYesﬂ to the following question: ﬁHave you ever been told by a doctor, 
nurse or other health professional that you have high blood pressure?ﬂ This de˜-nition excludes respondents classi˜ed as 
borderline hypertensive, and women who reported being diagnosed with hyperten-sion while pregnant.  Endnotes105 TFAH  RWJF  fasinfat.org1  Fryar CD, Carroll MD and Ogden CL.
