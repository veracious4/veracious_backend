 Let someone else clean and disinfect surfaces in common areas, but you should clean your bedroom and bathroom, if possible.
 If a caregiver or other person needs to clean and disinfect a sick person’s bedroom or bathroom, they should do so on an as-needed basis.
 The caregiver/other person should wear a mask and disposable gloves prior to cleaning.
 They should wait as long as possible after the person who is sick has used the bathroom before coming in to clean and use the bathroom.
 High-touch surfaces include phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.
 Clean and disinfect areas that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
 Use household cleaners and disinfectants.
 Clean the area or item with soap and water or another detergent if it is dirty.
 Then, use a household disinfectant.
 Be sure to follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product.
 Many products recommend keeping the surface wet for several minutes to ensure germs are killed.
 Many also recommend precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.
 Most EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective.
