16 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   Among all industrial sources of air pollution, none poses greater risks to human 
health and the environment 
than coal-fired power plants.  Emissions from coal
-fired power plants contribute to global warming, ozone smog, acid rain, regional 
haze, and
Ñperhaps most consequential of all from a public health standpoint 
Ñ fine particle pollution.  In 2000 and again in
 2004, the Clean Air Task Force 
commissioned comprehensive studies of health impacts caused by fine particle 
air pollution from the nationÕs roughly 500 coal
-fired power plants.  Each study 
incorporated the latest scientific findings concerning the link be
tween air 
pollution and public health, as well as up
-to-date emissions information.  
Both found that emissions from the U.S. power sector cause tens of thousands of 
premature deaths each year and hundreds of thousands of heart attacks, asthma 
attacks, emer
gency room visits, hospital admissions, and lost workdays.  
 This study provides a new update on the burden of death and disease from 
coal-based electricity production across the United States.  Estimated 
impacts are based on projected power sector emissio
ns in 2010.  As in our 
2000 and 2004 reports, Clean Air Task Force commissioned Abt Associates 
to conduct the analysis for this study.   Abt Associates developed estimates of 
health impacts using a well
-established and extensively peer
-reviewed 
methodology
 that has been approved by both the U.S. Environmental 
Protection AgencyÕs (EPAÕs) Science Advisory Board and the National 
Academy of Sciences (NAS).  In fact, the same methodology has provided the 
basis for regulatory impact analyses in the context of rec
ent EPA 
rulemakings.  
 Results from this latest assessment indicate that although coal plant 
emissions of key particle
-forming pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO
2) and 
nitrogen oxides (NOx) have declined significantly over the last several years, 
existing 
plants remain among the top contributors to fine particle pollution 
in the United States.  As a result, their emissions continue to take a 
significant toll on the health and longevity of millions of Americans.  
 Specifically, Abt
 AssociateÕs analysis finds
 that fine particle pollution from 
existing coal plants is expected to cause nearly 13,200 deaths in 2010.  
Additional impacts include an estimated 9,700 hospitalizations and more 
than 20,000 heart attacks per year.  The total monetized value of these 
adverse health impacts adds up to more than $100 billion per year.  This 
burden is not distributed evenly across the population. Adverse impacts are 
especially severe for the elderly, children, and those with respiratory disease.  
In addition, the poor, minori
ty groups, and people who live in areas 
downwind of multiple power plants are likely to be disproportionately 
exposed to the health risks and costs of fine particle pollution.  
 These figures take into account emissions reductions from regulatory 
changes that have happened since 2004, when the Clean Air Task Force last 
sponsored a comprehensive assessment of adverse health impacts from the 
 CATF

   Page 5 of 
16 fleet of existing coal-fired power plants.  In 2005, EPA issued the Clean Air 
Interstate Rule (CAIR), which was designe
d to achieve further reductions in 
SO2 and NOx emissions from power plants in the eastern United States. 
CAIR was subsequently challenged and ultimately struck down in federal 
court in 2008 for failing to conform to aspects of the Clean Air Act, but the 
court has allowed the CAIR requirements to remain in place until EPA can 
issue a replacement rule.  For the purposes of this reanalysis of health 
impacts from the nationÕs existing power plants, Abt Associates assumed 
that a regulation as stringent as the CAIR rule would be in place in 2010. 
 Comparing estimated health impacts from the 2004 analysis and this 
updated assessment serves to underscore the direct link between reduced 
power plant emissions and substantial public health benefits. For example, 
Abt AssociatesÕ estimate of 13,200 deaths from fine particle pollution in 2010 
compares to an estimate of nearly 24,000 deaths per year from existing 
plants in the 2004 study.  Similar public health gains are evident in the 
estimated incidence of other adverse i
mpacts including hospital admissions 
(9,700 in 2010 compared to 21,850 in 2004) and heart attacks (20,400 in 
2010 compared to 38,200 in 2004).  
 The improvements 
in public health 
estimated by Abt 
Associates are 
consistent with 
observed reductions 
in national sulfur 
dioxide emissions 
since 2004.  Over 
that period of time, 
sulfur dioxide emissions nationally 
fell from 10.3 million 
tons in 2004 to 5.7 
million tons in 
2009.1  These 
reductions largely 
resulted from the 
addition of over 130 flue gas desulfurization 
(FGD) (also known as ÒscrubbersÓ) installations on coal
-fired units, mostly 
in the eastern U.S.  These scrubbers were installed as a result of the 
combination of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), federal and state 
enforcement of the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air 
Act, and state power plan
t clean up laws.  These actions are responsible for 
saving nearly 11,000 lives per year and demonstrate that judicious use of the 
Clean Air Act offers a powerful solution to power plant pollution. 
  Jobs and Public Health
 Reducing air pollution from the nationÕs power 
plants is not just good for public h
ealth; it i
s also 
good for the nationÕs economy. Pollution control 
technologies, such as scrubbers for SO
2, are large 
projects that require a tremendous amount of 
skilled labor and materials.  Since 2004 roughly 
130 scrubbers have been installed at existin
g power plants.  The average scrubber requires 
380,000 man
-hours or 200 person
-years to 
complete.  Each scrubber installation can take 
roughly 2 years to complete which means roughly 
100 people working over this period.  These jobs 
are both engineering and
 management jobs as 
well as jobs for boilermakers and other skilled 
labor.

16 These results not only point to the necessity of preserving emissions 
reductions mandated under CAIR, but the need for even stronger measures 
to further mitigate the still unacceptably high burden of death and disease 
from coal
-fired power plants going forward. With a national commitment to 
deploy the most advanc
ed pollution control technologies, implement cost
-effective efficiency improvements, and steadily increase the use of inherently 
cleaner sources of electricity, the opportunity exists to save thousands more 
lives and avert costly health impacts due to powe
r sector emissions.  
   Specifically, to reduce the death and disease associated with power plant
-related particulate matter pollution from SO
2 and NOx, EPA should 
strengthen and finalize the recently proposed Transport Rule to replace the 
judicially invalidated Clean Air Interstate Rule. Stronger regional caps on 
SO2 and NOx pollution are achievable and cost effective and would reflect 
both the progress made and the performance of the most recent pollution 
control equipment.
2 In the last five years, emissions control equipment 
installed at power plants around the country (flue gas desulfurization or 
FGD for SO
2 and selective catalytic reduction or SCR for NOx reduction) 
have helped coal plants achieve reductions in their emission r
ates of SO2 and 
NOx by 
an average of 72 percent and 74 percent respectively.
3 The result has 
been a reduction in SO
2 and NOx pollution by almost half without noticeably 
affecting electricity prices or bills, natural gas prices, or the reliability of the 
power system.
  Over the years
; however, implementation of the Clean Air Act has often been 
stalled due to lawsuits and other delays. To preserve the recent emission 
reduction
s, speed further reductions,
 avoid years of costly litigation delay 
from industry ch
allenges to these regulations, and offer certainty with 
respect to environmental objectives and costs, CATF supports efforts in 
Congress to set a more protective national cap on power plant SO

ons per year in 2018.  This 
same proposal would establish a nat
ional power plant NOx cap at 1.6
 million 
tons in 2015. CATF has testified in support of strengthening and passing this 
legislation that, if enacted, would prevent tens of thousands of premature 
deaths, heart attacks and other health impacts.
4                           How do the numbers compare to EPAÕs?
  U.S. EPA in its Transport Rule proposal estimates that the rule will 
prevent the deaths of 14,000 to 36,000 people annually from power plant 
pollution starting in 2014.  How does this estimate compare to CATFÕs 
estimate in this report that power plant poll
ution is causing the premature 
deaths of 13,200 people in 2010?  The answer gets to the heart of why we 
need a strong Clean Air Transport Rule. 
  First, remember that 
one of the steps that has reduced emissions from 
power 
plants since our 2004 report rests
 on shaky legal ground.  Some of 
the reductions were 
driven by 
the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which 
the court struck down in 2008.  In the proposed Regulatory Impact 
Analysis of the Transport Rule, EPA had to assume that the CAIR does not 
exist.  So
, EPA compared the benefits of its proposed Transport Rule to a 
base case with none of the cleanup measures required by the CAIR.  By 
contrast, CATF in this report is estimating the total number of power 
plant pollution
-related deaths that will occur this 
year under current 
emissions
Ñthat is, with all the existing cleanup measures in place and 
operating.  CATF assumed that a rule at least as stringent as CAIR is in 
effect in 2010.  In fact, the CAIR rule has driven the installation of dozens 
of sulfur scrub
bers since 2004 and these emission control devices 
currently are running.  So, we credit those reductions as part of our 
analysis.  However, there is an operation and maintenance cost associated 
with these scrubbers and power companies will not continue to
 run them 
indefinitely unless they are legally required to do so.  That is why it is so 
important that EPA strengthen and finalize the Transport Rule 
Ð otherwise, these reductions are at risk.  
  Secondly, EPA estimated the lives saved by the Transport Rul
e as a range 
(i.e., 14,000 to 36,000 lives annually).  The lower number of this range is 
based on the results from the American Cancer Society study (Pope et al. 
2002) and the higher number is based on the Harvard Six
-Cities Study 
(Laden et al. 2006).  CAT
F in its 2000 and 2004 reports used the 
American Cancer Society study.  For consistencyÕs sake, we do so again in 
the current report. That means that if we used est
imates based on the 
Harvard Six
-Cities Study, the number of lives saved each year would be 
much, much higher.

16 The Link between Power Plant Pollution and Human Health
 The direct link between power plant emissions and human health has been 
documented in an extensive 
body of scientific research drawing on multiple 
lines of evidence, including several rigorous, large
-scale epidemiological 
studies.  Much of that literature has been reviewed and summarized in 
formal rulemakings and regulatory analyses by the U.S. Environm
ental 
Protection Agency (EPA) over the last several years and in reports published 
by the Clean Air Task Force and other organizations advocating on behalf of 
more stringent regulation of power sector emissions.
5  In brief, public health concerns have 
focused, for at least the last decade, on 
the role of very small airborne particles in causing or contributing to a host 
of respiratory and cardiopulmonary ailments and increasing the risk of 
premature death.  Fine particles are especially dangerous becaus
e they can 
bypass the bodyÕs defensive mechanisms and become lodged deep in the 
human lung.  Indeed, research also indicates that short
-term exposures to 
fine particle pollution is linked to cardiac effects, including increased risk of 
heart attack.
6  Mean
while, long
-term exposure to fine particle pollution has 
been shown to increase the risk of death from cardiac and respiratory 
diseases and lung cancer, resulting in shorter life
-expectancy for people 
living in the most polluted cities compared to people w
ho live in cleaner 
cities.7 And although research suggests fine particles reduce the average life 
span of the general population by a few years, the life of an individual dying 
as a result of exposure to air pollution may be shortened by 14 years.
8 Adverse
 effects, including excess mortality, occur even at low ambient 
concentrations of fine particlesÑsuggesting there is no ÒsafeÓ threshold for this type of pollution.9  Recent studies have also succeeded in identifying 
plausible biological mechanisms such as
 systemic inflammation, accelerated 
atherosclerosis, and altered cardiac function to explain the cardiac and other 
serious health impacts associated with exposure to airborne fine particles.
10 Because most fine particle
-related deaths are thought to occur w
ithin a year 
or two of exposure, reducing power plant pollution will have almost 
immediate benefits.
11  Unfortunately, persistently elevated levels of fine particle pollution are 
common across wide swaths of the country, particularly in the eastern 
United S
tates.  Fine particle pollution itself consists of a complex mixture of 
harmful pollutants including elements as diverse as soot, acid droplets, and 
metals.  Most of these pollutants originate from combustion sources such as 
power plants, diesel trucks, bu
ses, and cars.  East of the Mississippi, sulfates 
are a dominant ingredient of fine particle pollution. Sulfates are formed in 
the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide (SO
2) emissions, which also contribute
Ñalong with emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx)
Ñto the formation of airborne 
acidic particles. 
In 2008, power plants accounted for 66% of the national SO
2 inventory with the vast majority of this contribution (more than 98%) 
coming from coal
-fired power plants.
 Sulfur emissions from coal
-fired power 
plants thus 
emerge as the chief driver of adverse health impacts from 
industrial sources of air pollution across much of the country.  Moreover, 
many of the nationÕs existing coal plants are old
Ñin fact, the average age of 
the current coal fleet is 44 years and has very little in the way of modern 
 CATF

   Page 9 of 
16 pollution controls.  These same aging plants also contribute 
disproportionately to power
-sector emissions of other harmful pollutants 
such as mercury and other air toxics, as well as emissions of the chief 
greenhouse gas, car
bon dioxide.  
 Over the last two decades considerable progress has been achieved in 
reducing SO
2 and NOx emissions from the U.S. power sector.  Under a 
variety of Clean Air Act programs and regulations designed to address acid 
rain, particulate matter (PM) pollution, ozone smog, and regional haze, 
power plant 
emissions of SO
2 in 2009 fell to 
approximately one-third of the national total in 1980; a similar 
reduction was 
likewise achieved 
in national
-level 
power sector NOx 
emissions over the 
same time frame.
12  The updated estimates of 
adverse health impacts presented 
in the next section 
take these trends into account and 
assume that actual 
emissions in 2010 
remain in line with 
recent experience and regulatory expectations under the CAIR rule.  They 
show that despite the record of progress in reducing power plant emissions 
over the last 15 to 20 years, th
e burden of death and disease from coal
-based electricity production in the United States remains too high.
            What are fine particles
?  Fine particles are a mixture of harmful pollutants 
(e.g. soot, acid droplets, metals) that originate 
primarily from combustion sources such as power 
plants, diesel trucks, buses, and cars. In 1997 EPA 
first set national health standards for fine particles (referred to EPA as ÒPM2.5Ó or particulate matter 
smaller than 2.5 microns 
Ð 2.5 millionths of a 
meter in diameter 
Ð less than one
-hundredth the 
width of a human hair and smaller). Fine particles 
are either soot emitted directly from these 
combustion sources or formed in the atmosphere 
from power plant sulfur dioxide (SO
2) or nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) emissions. Among airborne particles, 
the smallest (fine) combustion particles are of 
gravest concern because they are 
so tiny that they can be inhaled deeply and be absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to vital organs, thus 
evading the human lungÕs natural defenses.

16 Results of the Analysis
     To analyze adverse health impacts from current levels of power plant 
emissions in the United States, Abt Asso
ciates analyzed emission data 
supplied by US EPA and 
applied methodologies used in previous Clean Air 
Task Force studies and in recent EPA regu
latory impact analyses which have
 been extensively peer
-reviewed and approved by both EPAÕs Science 
Advisory Boar
d and by the National Academy of Sciences.  Briefly, it begins 
by calculating the impact of a given change in power plant emissions on 
ambient air quality and specifically on ambient fine particle concentrations.  
It then applies results from epidemiologic
al studies to estimate expected 
changes in the incidence of several adverse health outcomes, such as hospital 
admissions, asthma attacks, and premature deaths.
 Table 1 summarizes the results of Abt AssociateÕs analysis for the nationÕs 
existing fleet of co
al plants in 2010.  The table includes estimates of the 
monetary cost associated with these impacts using standard valuation 
metrics for illness and premature death.  It suggests that the total monetized 
value of adverse health impacts attributable to exis
ting coal plants in the United States exceeds 
$100 billion per year.  
Figure 2 shows how these 
health risks and costs are distributed geographically.  Clearly those areas 
with the highest concentration of coal plants (indicated by yellow circles on 
the map
) bear a disproportionate share of the aggregate burden of adverse 
impacts.

   The analysis indicates that even with the 
first phase of the CAIR rule in place, the nationÕs power plants still cause a broad swath of death and 
disease across the coal
-burning Midwest, the South and the Mid
-Atlantic 
region. Table 2 shows state
-level results for those states with the highest 
incidence of adverse impacts.  Not surprisingly, states with large populations 
in close proximity to many coal
-fired power plants fare the worst.  
Conversely, states with large populations but without coal
-fired plants fare much better.  For example, Californi
aÑthe state with the largest population 
and some of the nationÕs worst air quality
Ñhas very few coal or oil
-fired power plants.  Abt Associates estimates that only 41 premature deaths are 
attributable to power plant pollution in California; as a result, th
e state ranks 
almost last for power plant related mortality risk (47
th out of the lower 48 
states and the District of Columbia).  West Virginia, the state with the 
highest reliance on coal for electricity production, ranks first in mortality 
risk.     CATF

  In terms of added mortality and morbidity risks to individuals in different 
parts of the country, residents of much smaller metropolitan areas in and 
around Òcoal countryÓ suffer the greatest individual risk of adverse health impacts.  Examples of such are
as include Johnstown, Pennsylvania; 
Steubenville, Ohio; Scranton, Pennsylvania; and Wheeling, West Virginia.  
People who live in these communities confront much higher mortality rates 
from fine particle pollution than do the residents of New York City: the
 estimated mortality risk for residents of Johnstown, Pennsylvania at 25 
deaths per 100,000 people, for example, is more than four times that for 
New York City residents at nearly 6 deaths per 100,000 people.

  At the same time, residents who live near, or are downwind (sometimes 
hundreds of miles) of the biggest coal plants suffer high mortality impacts, 
and other health impacts.  For example, just ten of the worst plants are 
responsible for over 1,600 premature
 deaths a year.

16 Conclusion 
 Though significant reductions in power sector SO
2 and NOx emissions have 
been achieved 
since 2000 when CATF first analyzed the impact of power 
plant pollution on our nationÕs health, the task of cleaning up the number 
one source of pollution is far from over.  Thousands of lives have been saved, 
but the fact remains that thousands more could
 be saved
Ñand a much 
greater number of asthma attacks, heart attacks, hospitalizations, emergency 
room visits, lost workdays and the associated societal costs could still be 
avoided.  The progress to date
Ñsince 2004, the U.S. has cut SO
2 and NOx 
pollution 
by almost half without affecting electricity prices or bills, natural 
gas prices, or the reliability of the power system
Ñpowerfully confirms that: 
(1) the Clean Air Act works, and (2) the technologies required to achieve 
deep reductions in these pollutants
 are widely available and very effective.  
Now is the time to finish the job of cleaning up our nationÕs power sector by 
strengthening and finalizing a stringent Transport Rule, as well as by 
reducing mercury and other toxics, as well as greenhouse gas emi
ssions.  
Doing so
 would provide a host of benefits
Ñprominent among them further 
substantial gains in the health and longevity of millions of Americans
Ñand would help propel the nation to a more sustainable energy future.

. 2 CATF believes that an eastern regional cap of 1.75 million tons per year for SO
2 and .9 million tons 
per year for NOx by 2014 are justified and CATF will be demonstrating this in upcoming research 
and technical comments to the CATR docket.
