 A substantial amount of research has been done on relaxation techniques.
 However, for many health conditions, the number or size of the studies has been small, and some studies have been of poor quality.
 What do we know about the effectiveness of relaxation techniques?
 Psychological therapies, which may include relaxation techniques, can help manage chronic headaches and other types of chronic pain in children and adolescents.
 Relaxation techniques have also been studied for other conditions, but either they haven't been shown to be useful, research results have been inconsistent, or the evidence is limited.
 What do we know about the safety of relaxation techniques?
 Relaxation techniques are generally considered safe for healthy people, although there have been a few reports of negative experiences such as increased anxiety.
 People with serious physical or mental health problems should discuss relaxation techniques with their health care providers.
 The goal is similar in all: to produce the body's natural relaxation response, characterized by slower breathing, lower blood pressure, and a feeling of increased well-being.
 Meditation and practices that include meditation with movement, such as yoga and tai chi, can also promote relaxation.
 You can find information about these practices elsewhere on the NCCIH Web site.
 Stress management programs commonly include relaxation techniques.
 People who use relaxation techniques frequently are more likely to benefit from them.
 Regular, frequent practice is particularly important if you're using relaxation techniques to help manage a chronic health problem.
 Continuing use of relaxation techniques is more effective than short-term use.
 Biofeedback-assisted relaxation uses electronic devices to teach you to produce changes in your body that are associated with relaxation, such as reduced muscle tension.
 Guided imagery may be self-directed or led by a practitioner or a recording.
 Progressive relaxation is often combined with guided imagery and breathing exercises.
 Relaxation techniques have also been shown to be useful for older adults with anxiety.
 On the other hand, relaxation techniques may not be the best way to help people with generalized anxiety disorder.
 Generalized anxiety disorder is a mental health condition, lasting for months or longer, in which a person is often worried or anxious about many things and finds it hard to control the anxiety.
 Studies indicate that long-term results are better in people with generalized anxiety disorder who receive a type of psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioral therapy than in those who are taught relaxation techniques.
 Studies have shown that women who were taught self-hypnosis have a decreased need for pain medicine during labor.
 Biofeedback hasn't been shown to relieve labor pain.
 A 2013 evaluation of the research concluded that electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback, in which people are taught to control and reduce muscle tension, helped to reduce fibromyalgia pain, at least for short periods of time.
 However, EMG biofeedback didn't affect sleep problems, depression, fatigue, or health-related quality of life in people with fibromyalgia, and its long-term effects haven't been established.
 Biofeedback has been studied for both tension headaches and migraines.
 An evaluation of high-quality studies concluded that there's conflicting evidence about whether biofeedback can relieve tension headaches.
 Studies have shown decreases in the frequency of migraines in people who were using biofeedback.
 However, it's unclear whether biofeedback is better than a placebo.
 Other Relaxation Techniques.
 Relaxation techniques other than biofeedback have been studied for tension headaches.
 An evaluation of high-quality studies found conflicting evidence on whether relaxation techniques are better than no treatment or a placebo.
 Some studies suggest that other relaxation techniques are less effective than biofeedback.
 However, it's uncertain whether relaxation techniques can have long-term effects on high blood pressure.
 Relaxation techniques can be combined with other strategies for getting a good night's sleep, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule; avoiding caffeine, alcohol, heavy meals, and strenuous exercise too close to bedtime; and sleeping in a quiet, cool, dark room.
 However, other psychological therapies, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy, are associated with overall symptom improvement in people with irritable bowel syndrome.
 However, an assessment of many studies concluded that relaxation is less helpful than more extensive forms of treatment (psychotherapy or medication).
 An analysis of data on hospitalized cancer patients showed that those who received integrative medicine therapies, such as guided imagery and relaxation response training, during their hospitalization had reductions in both pain and anxiety.
 The evidence is particularly promising for headaches: the effect on pain may last for several months after treatment, and the therapies also help to reduce anxiety.
 The limited evidence from these studies suggests that relaxation techniques might be useful, especially in reducing the intrusiveness of the problem.
 In a study that compared the two techniques, autogenic training was found to be less effective than cognitive-behavioral therapy as a quit-smoking aid.
 However, this study involved patients in an alcohol detoxification program, so its results may not be applicable to other people.
 Preliminary research suggests that a guided relaxation routine might help reduce cigarette cravings.
 A few studies have shown that programs that include relaxation techniques may help relieve symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction.
 However, occasionally, people report negative experiences such as increased anxiety, intrusive thoughts, or fear of losing control.
 There have been rare reports that certain relaxation techniques might cause or worsen symptoms in people with epilepsy or certain psychiatric conditions, or with a history of abuse or trauma.
 People with heart disease should talk to their health care provider before doing progressive muscle relaxation.
 Examples of topics currently being studied include  The use of relaxation techniques and other complementary approaches for back pain in real-world health care settings Guided imagery and relaxation response training for pain management in hospitalized patients  Who Teaches Relaxation Techniques?
 Also, people sometimes learn the simpler relaxation techniques on their own.
 More to Consider  If you have severe or long-lasting symptoms of any kind, see your health care provider.
 You might have a condition that needs to be treated promptly.
 For example, if depression or anxiety persists, it's important to seek help from a qualified health care professional.
 Tell all your health care providers about any complementary or integrative health approaches you use.
 Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health.
 This will help ensure coordinated and safe care.
