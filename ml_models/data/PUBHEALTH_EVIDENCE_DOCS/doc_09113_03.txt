 PMID:     22426019          DOI:        10.3233/JAD-2012-112141        Item in Clipboard         Full-text links   CiteDisplay options   Display options      Format    AbstractPubMedPMID     Abstract               Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic pigment present in the spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), is known to possess a pleiotropic activity such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloid-β activities.
 However, these benefits of curcumin are limited by its poor aqueous solubility and oral bioavailability.
 In the present study, a polymer-based nanoparticle approach has been utilized to deliver drugs to neuronal cells.
 Curcumin was encapsulated in biodegradable poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) based-nanoparticulate formulation (Nps-Cur).
 Dynamic laser light scattering and transmission electronic microscopy analysis indicated a particle diameter ranging from 80 to 120 nm.
 The entrapment efficiency was 31% with 15% drug-loading.
 In vitro release kinetics of curcumin from Nps-Cur revealed a biphasic pattern with an initial exponential phase followed by a slow release phase.
 Cellular internalization of Nps-Cur was confirmed by fluorescence and confocal microscopy with a wide distribution of the fluorescence in the cytoplasm and within the nucleus.
 The prepared nanoformulation was characterized for cellular toxicity and biological activity.
 Cytotoxicity assays showed that void PLGA-nanoparticles (Nps) and curcumin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (Nps-Cur) were nontoxic to human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells.
 Moreover, Nps-Cur was able to protect SK-N-SH cells against H2O2 and prevent the elevation of reactive oxygen species and the consumption of glutathione induced by H2O2.
 Interestingly, Nps-Cur was also able to prevent the induction of the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 in the presence of H2O2.
 Taken together, these results suggest that Nps-Cur could be a promising drug delivery strategy to protect neurons against oxidative damage as observed in Alzheimer's disease.
