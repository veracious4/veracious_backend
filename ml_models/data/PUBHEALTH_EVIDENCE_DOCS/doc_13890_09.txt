 Experts worry the problem is a "new normal.
 "An average of 20 veterans a day committed suicide in 2014, a trend that reflects record high rates among young men fresh out of the military and growing numbers of women taking their lives, the first actual count of suicides among former service members shows.The Department of Veterans Affairs previously had only estimated suicides, saying in 2010 there was an average of 22 a day.
 The 2014 data released Thursday is based on a precise tabulation of the 7,403 deaths.David Shulkin, VA undersecretary for health, noted the slight decline from the 2010 estimate, but added, "it's still far too high.
 "The 2014 count is the first slice of a massive examination of 55 million veteran death records dating back to 1979.
 Shulkin said that a final report due in several weeks will detail more suicide trends.The VA found the worst suicide pattern among male veterans, ages 18-29.
 "It is difficult to understand why that is happening.
 They include adding staff to the crisis hotline for veterans (800-273-8255), identifying veterans at high risk, increasing mental health counselors and expanding mental health therapy via telephone.In 2014, veterans accounted for 18% of all suicides in the United States, but made up only 8.5% of the population.
