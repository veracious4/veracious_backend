 The apartment was gutted and decontaminated, at a cost to Dallas County of about a quarter of a million dollars.On Friday, a bare room was visible behind the balcony’s smudged sliding glass doors.
 Even the carpet was ripped out, leaving a concrete floor with a plastic fork, a $13.99 price tag for lingerie and little else.
 A woman from Malaysia who lives next door said in broken English that she felt safe.
 Another neighbor, Biak Bualhring, 24, from Burma, walked below the empty apartment and hardly glanced up.
 A Cascade of Contacts From One Ebola Case in DallasHundreds have been tracked after potential direct and indirect contact with Ebola patients from Dallas.“My pastor told me don’t worry too much,” she said.
 “Our family feels O.K.”Dallas, like Ms. Bualhring, has moved on.
 The city, the first to grapple with the virus in the United States and the near panic and quarantines that it set off, reached the end of its Ebola ordeal Friday, as the last person being monitored was cleared by officials.That person — a hospital worker who handled medical waste on Oct. 17 — was part of the final group of people undergoing twice-daily checks in the Dallas region for 21 days, the maximum incubation period for the disease.The 16 people were all health care workers who had possible contact either with two nurses infected with Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, with their bodily fluids or with potentially contaminated surfaces or medical waste.
 Fifteen in that group were cleared Thursday, and officials checked the temperature of the last person Friday evening, and found no symptoms.
 The last person was not identified by officials, but was considered to be at low risk.
 More than 40 others who had direct or indirect contact with Mr. Duncan were taken off the monitoring list in late October.
 A total of 177 people were monitored in the Dallas region, with only three cases of Ebola confirmed, in Mr. Duncan and in two nurses who treated him, Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson.
 “Thanksgiving came early for Dallas, because we have a lot to be thankful for,” said Judge Clay Jenkins, Dallas County’s chief executive.
 “It’s a joyous day.
 This outbreak that began with Eric Duncan is over for Dallas.”County officials estimated the Ebola-related price tag here at nearly $1 million, not including money spent by the city, state and federal government.
 To mark the end of the monitoring period here, on Friday, former President George W. Bush, who lives in Dallas, visited Presbyterian hospital and greeted nurses and doctors, including Ms. Vinson.
 And President Obama spoke via a conference call on Friday afternoon with Judge Jenkins, Gov.
 Rick Perry, Mayor Mike Rawlings and the state health commissioner, Dr. David Lakey, praising their leadership.
 Thomas W. Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the end of monitoring in the Dallas area “shows that the fast isolation of people sick with Ebola and good contact tracing can prevent the spread of this disease.”“But we need to be careful of declaring anything over, because the epidemic continues in West Africa,” Mr. Skinner said.
