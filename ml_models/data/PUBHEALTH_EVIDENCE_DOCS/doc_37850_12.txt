 Shutterstock / Ken Wolter						       Ulta Beauty is furloughing many store and salon associates as the company‚Äôs stores remain closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 ‚ÄúAfter thoughtful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to temporarily furlough many of our store and salon associates.
 During these uncertain times, we will do all we can to make sure these associates are supported,‚Äù Mary Dillon, Ulta chief executive officer, said in a statement.
 Ulta said it intends to bring the workforce back when ‚Äúit is safe to do so,‚Äù and that the furlough will go into effect April 19.
 Affected employees can apply for unemployment benefits, Ulta said, and will remain enrolled in company benefits.
 At the same time, Dillon has said she would indefinitely forgo her base salary, and has made a $500,000 donation to the Ulta Beauty Associate Relief Program, which provides grants to associates facing personal hardship.
 The Ulta Beauty executive team and board of directors are also expected to make personal donations to the program.
 The business said its stores will remain closed ‚Äúuntil it is safe to reopen‚Äù in order to slow the spread of COVID-19, and to keep workers and shoppers safe.
 Ulta‚Äôs decision follows that of Sephora, which said it would lay off some part-time and seasonal employees, and reduce pay for other employees in late March.

 @wwd We are at a ‚Äòpivotal point‚Äô for ethical fashion over fast fashion.
 ‚Å£ ‚Å£ Edited, a retail market analytics firm that publishes reports on runway and retail trends, said COVID-19 has caused a blow to fast fashion‚Äôs typically quick cadence despite some signs of recovery.
 In the U.S. and U.K. combined, new product arrivals for Q3 2020 were 11 percent lower than in 2019, owed in part to the pandemic-induced supply chain pause.
 But the fact that levels haven‚Äôt picked back up indicate that fast fashion‚Äôs pace of product pushes may not return to pre-COVID-19 levels, particularly as disdain for inventory glut and its often landfill fate rises.‚Å£ ‚Å£ In its annual sustainability report released last week, Edited said the ‚Äúdegrowth movement‚Äù may be a big part of what rewrites fashion‚Äôs future.‚Å£ ‚Å£ ‚ÄúThe events of 2020 have made it clear that the fashion industry cannot return to its pre-pandemic processes and levels of mass production.
 There is an increasing mind-set shift around the degrowth movement ‚Äî working less, buying less and making less,‚Äù the report noted.
 ‚ÄúGoing beyond the need for minimalism, retailers need to encourage consumers to make slower and more ethical fashion choices, spotlighting the concept of ‚Äòbuy less, buy better.
