 Copypasta is a term for a block of text that has been copied and pasted multiple times.
 This often leads to a kind of generic or stilted result, or something that is slightly jumbled or disjointed.
 Copypasta makes its way across a social media platform or forum or an email chain to reach multiple users.
 It is a viral message that keeps getting replicated and sent, either because of some natural interest or a kind of internal command to share it, similar to a chain letter.
 However, copypasta is organically spread — it is a human-generated type of message, regardless of whether people think of it as spam.The term copypasta is said to have emerged from 4chan forums around 2006.
 There are now different kinds of copypasta with their own particular messages.
 Some of them are archived at sites like Know Your Meme, where some of the common elements of the copypasta text blocks are presented.
