 The last time the VA conducted a study like this was in 2010, but that report included data from only 20 states.In 2014, 7,403 American veterans committed suicide, out of 41,425 suicides among U.S. adults that year.
 That's just under 18 percent, down from 22 percent in 2010.Today’s report also included comparisons between civilians and veterans.
 From 2001 to 2014, the VA found, suicides among U.S. adult civilians increased 23 percent while veteran suicides increased 32 percent — making the risk of suicide 21 percent greater for veterans than civilians (after controlling for age and gender).Older veterans face a higher risk of suicide, the data showed.
 In 2014 about 65 percent of veterans who died from suicide were 50 years or older.The VA said it was “aggressively” undertaking new measures to combat suicide, including same-day access for veterans with urgent mental health needs.
 According to the VA, techniques like predictive modeling can help determine which veterans may be at the highest risk of suicide so that health care providers can get involved earlier.“Veterans in the top 0.1 percent of risk, who have a 43-fold increased risk of death from suicide within a month, can be identified before clinical signs of suicide are evident in order to save lives before a crisis occurs,” the VA said in a statement.Data in this analysis supported that veterans who seek VA services may be able to decrease their risk of suicide.
 The report said that since 2001, the rate of suicide among veterans who used VA services increased by 8.8 percent while the rate of suicide among veterans who did not use VA services increased by 38.6 percent.The VA treated more than 1.6 million veterans for mental health in 2015.Comments (0)Share to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail this articleTop StoriesJudges want more evidence from Trump campaign as election cases get tossedNov 07, 4:01 AMBiden says 'we're going to win' as Trump falls behind in key statesNov 06, 11:07 PMEta strengthens back into tropical storm Saturday, will approach Florida Sunday1 hour agoHow Joe Biden gained an edge in Michigan Nov 06, 3:14 PMTrump predicts 'lot of litigation' in fight to keep his jobNov 06, 8:04 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour CA Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsCopyright © 2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
