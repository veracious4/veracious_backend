A
 
positive
 
antibody
 
test
 
for
 
the
 
virus
 
that
 
causes
 
COVID

may
 
indicate

it

you

from
 
reinfection.
 
 

 
A
 
prior
 
positive
 
diagnostic
 
test
 
(nose
 
swab
 
or
 
saliva)
 
means
 
you
 
have
 
had
 
COVID
-
19
 
and
 
may
 
be
 
less
 
likely
 
to
 
be
 
re

infected.
 
We
 

 
know
 
how
 
strong
 
that
 
protection
 
is
 
or
 
for
 
how
 
long
 
it
 
lasts.
  
 

 
Be
 
cautious in using these tests to make decisions about 
who you have sex with and what 
kind of sex you have 
since 
antibody test results
 
are 
not
 
definite proof of immunity
