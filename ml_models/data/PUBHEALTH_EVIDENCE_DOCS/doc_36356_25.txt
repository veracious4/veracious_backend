 It was contagious—meaning, it spread from one person to another.
 People who had smallpox had a fever and a distinctive, progressive skin rash.
 Most people with smallpox recovered, but about 3 out of every 10 people with the disease died.
 Many smallpox survivors have permanent scars over large areas of their body, especially their faces.
 Some are left blind.
 Thanks to the success of vaccination, smallpox was eradicated, and no cases of naturally occurring smallpox have happened since 1977.
 The last natural outbreak of smallpox in the United States occurred in 1949.
