 Since then, the virus has spread to infect more than 100,000 people.
 Here’s how the virus grew to a global pandemic.

 Amazon plans to deploy the new workers to fuel its sprawling e-commerce machine and is raising pay for all employees in fulfillment centers, transportation, stores and deliveries in the U.S. and Canada by $2 an hour through April.
 In the U.K., it will go up £2 ($2.45) per hour and approximately €2 ($2.24) an hour in many EU countries, according to the company.
 Amazon now pays $15-per-hour as a starting wage to workers in its fulfillment centers around the U.S.
 The tech giant’s decision to go on a hiring spree and boost worker pay shows the dual challenge companies such as Amazon face as they seek to meet surging demand for food and key household items and also take care of employees at the front lines of the pandemic.
 Amazon employed nearly 800,000 full and part-time employees as of Dec. 31.
 Countries around the world this week took more drastic measures to contain the spread of the virus, closing schools for tens of millions of children and ordering citizens to stay home except for essential functions.
 President Trump advised Americans to avoid bars and restaurants and gathering in groups larger than 10.
 France announced a lockdown, and San Francisco ordered residents to stay home.
