 Summary of eRumor:The eRumor claims that seven    woman have died from smelling free perfume samples that came to them    in the mail.
 It also says that the government thinks it may be    a terrorist act, but doesn’t want to alarm people so is not talking    about it.
 The Truth:There are not any reports, inside or outside the government, about    poisonous perfume or poisonous perfume being sent through the mail.
 A 2010 version of this email resurfaced saying that seven women died 		after being treated at Gleneagles Hospital and that this could be 		related to terrorism.
 That too, is a hoax.
 Click for findings This is the kind of email that should not be passed along to others    because it alleges something very alarming, but without any    information whatsoever that would allow anyone to verify it.
 No names of victims or families, no locations, no hospitals, and no    official law enforcement or health agencies.If this had actually happened, it would be big news and difficult to    keep hidden.
