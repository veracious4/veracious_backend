 Patients and Methods Two parallel randomised, double‐blind, double‐dummy, placebo‐controlled, multicentre, phase III studies were undertaken to evaluate two doses of enclomiphene citrate vs testosterone gel (AndroGel®1.62%) on TT, LH, FSH, and sperm counts in overweight men aged 18–60 years with secondary hypogonadism.
 Men were screened and enrolled in the trials (ZA‐304 and ZA‐305).
 All enrolled men had early morning serum TT levels in the low or low normal range (≤300 ng/dL; ≤10.4 nmol/L) and had low or normal LH ( 450 ng/dL (&gt;15.6 nmol/L) on 12.5 mg enclomiphene citrate were up‐titrated to 25 mg enclomiphene citrate.
 Sham up‐titrations were done in certain cases.
 Visit 7 for concomitant medication assessment and study drug pick up for new supply was after visit 6 lab results were available.
 Visit 8 was at week 10.
 Visit 9 was the end of treatment at week 16 and was intended as an opportunity for conducting a physical examination with tests.
 The men returned 1 week (7 ± 3 days) later for Visit 10.
 Vital signs were taken at Visits 8, 9 and 10.
 Semen samples were obtained at Visits 9 and 10 (in parallel to those taken at Visit 2 and 3).
 Hormone levels were re‐assessed at Visits 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10.
 A serial collection for TT, LH and FSH were done at Visit 9.
 Assessments of certain blood chemistry values and haematology were performed at Visits 6, 8, 9 and 10 but the full assessment was only at Visit 9.
 The lipid panel and diet and exercise counselling was repeated at Visit 9.
 Blood samples for the determination of trough levels of study drug were obtained at Visit 9.
 Determination of PSA level was done at Visits 6, 8, 9 and 10 to compare with earlier time points.
 Diary cards were collected at Visits 5 through 9.
 Levels of HbA1c, FPG and insulin were determined at Visit 9.
 The combined safety population (SP) was 256 men, which was the same as ITT population (all individuals who had taken at least one dose of study medication).
 The number of men in the per‐protocol (PP) population who completed all portions of the study was 217.
 Those individuals respond to the drugs relatively quickly 23 and clinically significant changes in TT levels are seen in as few as 14 days of treatment with enclomiphene citrate 24.
 Therefore the SP was used for most analyses of adverse events (AEs).
 The baseline characteristics of the two study populations for both trials are given in Table 1.

 In the placebo group TT levels remained low throughout the study.
 There were no significant changes between week 4 and EOS (up to day 112 for the PP population) for any group.

 After the cessation of treatment (off‐drug point), TT did not return to baseline values for the pooled enclomiphene groups, but remained higher than baseline (P 6 IU/L after 4 weeks of treatment with the pooled doses of enclomiphene citrate.
 There were no significant changes from week 4 to the EOS for the placebo group whereas the testosterone gel group had a clear decrease in serum FSH that appeared to decrease to a trough by or about day 112.
 After cessation of treatment, the mean FSH levels for men in the pooled enclomiphene citrate group were higher than those for men on either placebo or testosterone gel, as was seen for serum LH.
 The mean FSH for men on testosterone gel increased over this time period and it remained low but similar to baseline values (5.2 vs 6.1 IU/L).

 The effects seen in ZA‐304 were mimicked in ZA‐305.
 There was an increase between baseline and the EOS in TT, LH and FSH for the pooled enclomiphene citrate group, with a slight loss in the 7 days after cessation of treatment.
 The testosterone gel group had an increase in TT but decreases in LH and FSH between baseline and 16 weeks.
 The placebo group showed little difference in any of these values.
 The differences between baseline and the EOS values are given in Figs 2 and 3 for LH and FSH, and in Table 1 for TT and for the comparison of the two studies results.
 Sperm Concentration The effects of treatment for all groups on sperm counts are given in Table 1 and Fig.
 4 for both studies in terms of both absolute numbers and change from baseline.
 This represents both studies in comparison.
 Values for sperm count in the placebo groups were not different from baselines and were not different from their respective pooled enclomiphene citrate group values.
 In the testosterone gel‐treatment groups, the decrease from baseline was significant for ZA‐304 and for ZA‐305 (both P 750 ng/dL (26.0 nmol/L).
 This may not reflect the case of hypogonadal men using a gel under physician's care unless the patient's TT was measured repeatedly for the purpose of dose up‐ or down‐titration.
 While speculative but based on endocrine physiology, higher TT levels with testosterone gel therapy could suppress spermatogenesis and pituitary function more than seen in the present study.
 Supernormal levels of testosterone may be achieved with TRT with both injectables and topicals 26.
 A mid‐normal range (350–700 ng/dL) is recommended for adult men with androgen deficiency syndromes 2.
 Overall the safety profile of both dose levels of enclomiphene citrate was acceptable.
 There were few AEs attributable to enclomiphene citrate.
 There were no unexpected findings regarding cardiovascular safety profile.
 Changes in PSA and haematocrit seen with both enclomiphene citrate and testosterone gel are secondary to increases in TT.
 The one death in the two studies combined and not caused by a traffic accident was an ischaemic stroke determined to be unlikely to be caused by the drug.
 Study limitations need to be acknowledged.
 First, we have addressed the less robust response on TT to testosterone gel than seen in their pivotal trials.
 Second, improvement in patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) was not addressed in the present study, which focused on TT levels and spermatogenesis.
 At the core of this issue is the lack of consensus about whether PROs fully capture improvements in symptoms with therapy; efforts are ongoing to identify and craft the ideal questionnaire.
 Third, the true impact of a medication on male fertility is difficult to assess without actual pregnancy or live birth data.
 While far from being a true proxy for fertility, the semen analysis has benefit in this regard.
 However, for logistic reasons, only sperm concentration was analysed, not sperm motility or morphology.
 Finally, the duration of the study is relatively short‐term compared with the length of therapy seen in clinical practice.
 In conclusion, this level 1 evidence shows that enclomiphene citrate reverses the two hallmarks of secondary hypogonadism, namely, low serum TT and low LH.
 There is also an elevation of serum FSH, which probably accounts for the observed retention of sperm counts.
 The TT elevating activity of enclomiphene citrate treatment persists for at least 1 week after discontinuation, as a result of maintaining LH.
 A comparator topical TRT agent, in this case testosterone gel, will raise TT but suppress serum levels of both LH and FSH.
 Levels of all three hormones decline rapidly after discontinuation to levels that are lower than baseline suggesting a rapid de‐escalation or ‘bottoming out’ effect.
 As has been noted previously 21, this persistence of the effects of enclomiphene citrate after the last dose would be an advantage over topical agent, in the sense that skipping a dose would not lead to a rapid bottoming‐out that would be seen with the topical agent.
 The elevations of LH, FSH and TT in men taking enclomiphene citrate underpin the positive effects we have seen on sperm counts and are in marked contrast to the suppressive effects of exogenous testosterone delivery systems on sperm counts.
 This could be an important consideration in the treatment of hypogonadal men wishing to preserve fertility.
