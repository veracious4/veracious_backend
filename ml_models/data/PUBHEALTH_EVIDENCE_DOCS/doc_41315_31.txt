The European Commission has proposed formalising exposure limits.
 "Formaldehyde is a known human carcinogen that requires close regulation, which the funeral sector has always taken into account.
 As is the current case, it will still be used in a controlled manner.
 "As a responsible regulator we have always worked closely with the funeral industry to understand its particular needs.
 This has informed our discussions at EU level.
 "Our dialogue with the sector on the proposed limits will continue whatever the terms of our departure from the European Union."
 The HSE said the three-year exemption period would come on top of the usual two-year implementation period for a new regulation to come into force, meaning it will not apply to the funeral sector for five years.Funeral directors in the UK are concerned they will not be able to find a replacement for formaldehyde and that they will be faced with extra costs.Formaldehyde, which can cause irritation and has been linked to nasopharyngeal cancer, is one of five industrial chemicals to be added to the European Commission's list of restricted carcinogens and mutagens.
 The embalming of bodies is prohibited in the Jewish and Muslim faiths.
 It is not forbidden in Hinduism but is rare because cremation normally takes place within 24 hours of death.The funeral industry estimates between 50% and 55% of cadavers in the UK undergo some form of embalming so they can be viewed by relatives.
 "For funeral directors, embalming offers the only realistic solution that will delay deterioration and present the deceased person at peace and as close to their appearance before death as possible; particularly where there has been a post mortem, examination, traumatic death - or to accommodate the increasing gap between death and a funeral which is now often two or three weeks.
 "For all of these reasons, embalming remains a common funeral choice in the UK by families, much more so than in Europe.
 "image captionAnthea McIntyre secured a temporary exemption for funeral directorsHe welcomed the three-year delay in the implementation of the EU directive to "allow funeral firms to continue the search for a feasible alternative" but suggested the UK may need to "change the culture around funerals to make the need for embalming redundant".
 All the alternatives to formalin tried so far "simply do not work as a preservative", he added.
 West Midlands MEP Anthea McIntyre, who this week secured the three-year exemption in a vote in the European Parliament, said: "This new legislation is well meant, but I don't think officials in Brussels realised quite how big the impact would be on Britain.
 "Refrigeration has been used as an alternative to embalming but that can lead to dehydrated remains and, with repeated thawing and refreezing, accelerated decay, leading to "an unwholesome viewing situation", a briefing note by the funeral industry said.
 "For the close viewing of the deceased to take place, it is essential for the deceased to be embalmed so the person viewing is safe (free from the hazard of infection), and that the deceased's remains are fixed and stable and do not chemically break down or decompose and/or release embarrassing odours from decomposition," it added.The European Commission says setting maximum values for the concentration in workplace air of the five chemicals added to its list will improve conditions for more than 1,000,000 EU workers and prevent more than 22,000 work-related illnesses over the next 50 years.
