 This may be a synopsis of the full weight-of-evidence narrative.

 Quantitative Estimate of Carcinogenic Risk from Inhalation Exposure (PDF) (9 pp, 207 K)  Inhalation Unit Risk:
 									3 x 10 -3 per µg/m3  Extrapolation Method:
 					 					Linear extrapolation.
 Two-piece linear spline model with knot at 1,600 ppm × days for lymphoid cancer.
 Two-piece linear spline model with knot at 5,750 ppm × days for breast cancer incidence in females.
 POD of 1% extra risk was used for both cancer types.
 Tumor site(s): Reproductive, Immune Tumor type(s): Lymphoid cancer, (female) breast cancer (Steenland et al., 2003, 2004) Note: ADAF -- EPA has concluded that ethylene oxide is carcinogenic by a mutagenic mode of action.
 Application of age-dependent adjustment factors (ADAFs) to the inhalation unit risk is recommended in combination with appropriate exposure data when assessing risk associated with early-life exposure.
