   Memorandum Explaining Basis for Revocation of Emergency Use Authorization for 
Emergency Use of Chloroquine Phosphate and Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate
  On March 28, 2020, 
the 
Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority 
(BARD
A) requested and
 the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration (F
DA or The Agency)
 issued an 
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for 
emergency use of oral formulations of chloroquine 
phosphate
 (CQ)
 and hydr
oxychloroquine sulfate
 (HCQ)
 for the treatment of 2019 coronavirus 
disease (COVID
-19).
  Based on information available to FDA at the time, the Agency 
determined that CQ and HCQ may be effective in treating COVID
-19 and that the known and 
potential benefits
 of 
CQ and 
HCQ outweigh the known and potential risks for this use. The 
Agency limited the use of 
the 
authorized product
s to adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg or 
more and are hospitalized with COVID
-19 when
 participation in a clinical trial is not available, 
or participation is not feasible
.1   Since that time, emerging data and published literature have raised new ques
tions on whether CQ 
and HCQ may be effective in treating COVID
-19 and whether CQ and 
HCQ™s known and 
potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks associated with 
their 
authorized use. 

As part of the Agency™s 
ongoing
 review of the appropriatene
ss of 
the
 EUA, 
FDA 
scientific 
staff
 conducted review
s of
 these new data and 
also 
conducted new analyses
 of information known at 
the time of initial authorization.
   
A summary of this information includes the following:
    The 
suggested dosing 
regimens
 for CQ and HCQ as detailed in the Fact Sheets are
 unlikely
 to produce an
 antiviral effect
.  Earlier
 reports
 of 
decreased 
viral shedding
 with 
CQ or 
HCQ treatment
 have not been 
consistently replicated and recent data from a 
randomized controlled 
trial 
assessing 
probability of negative conversion showed no difference
 between HCQ and standard of 
care alone.
   Current U.S. treatment gu
idelines do not recommend the use 
of CQ or 
HCQ in 
hospitalized patients with COVID
-19 outside of a clinical tria
l, and the NIH guidelines 
now recommend against such use outside of a clinical trial.
   Recent data from a large
 randomized controlled trial 
show
ed no evidence of 
benefit
 for 
mortality or other outcomes such as hospital length of stay or need for mechanical 

ventilation
 of HCQ treatment in hospitalized patients with COVID
-19.                                                    1 Letter of Authorization, March 28, 2020.

 Based on the above, 
the Agency has 
concluded that it is unlikely that CQ and HCQ may be 
effective in treating COVID
-19. Further, in light of ongoing
 reports of serious cardiac adverse 
events
 and
 several newly reported cases 
of 
methemoglobinemia
 in COVID
-19 patients
, the 
Agency has
 concluded
 that the known and potential benefits of CQ and HCQ do not outweigh 
the known and potential risks for 
the 
authorized uses. 
Therefore, 
the Agency
 believe
s that the
 criteria
2 for issuance of an authorization
 are no longer met 
and 
is revoking
3  EUA 
039.4   Authorization of EUA 039
 
 
The information 
available 
at th
e time 
the EUA was issued 
regarding potential benefit 
included
 several components
.5 First,
 CQ and 
HCQ are antimalarial drugs that 
were reported
 to have in 
vitro activity against SARS
-CoV
-2 at drug co
ncentrations achievable by doses considered safe in 
humans.
6,7,8 A brief clinical report o
n 100 COVID
-19 patients
 in China
 reported clinical 
improvement 
and superior viral clearance 
with 
CQ treatment versus an unspecified control.
9 Additionally, a clinical survey by French researchers involving 20 COVID
-19 patients reported 
that 
HCQ alone and in combination with azithromycin was associated with viral load reduction 

over 6 days. 
In the French
 report, t
he viral load changes were statistically significant compared 
to a nonrandomized control group and were more pronounced in patients who received the 

combination.
10 Based on experience with other viral illnesses, it was reasonable to believe that 
reduction in viral load may be predictive of clinical benefit. 
  
At the time, a
 number of national treatment guidelines had been reported as incorporating 
recommendations regarding 
the 
use of CQ or HCQ in the setting of COVID
-19, including 
guidelines used i
n China and Korea. Expert assessments associated with a number
 of U
.S. medical institutions also included discussion o
n the use of these drugs in clinical care. 
Regarding
 the
 known and potential risks, the safety profiles of 
CQ and 
HCQ were well established as these 
are approved and commonly used anti
-malarial drugs and, in the case of 
HCQ, approved for 
rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus as well. The 
suggested
 dosing for 
CQ and 

HCQ under the EUA was within the range o
f that recommended in the
 approved labeling
 for 
these products
. In general, the drugs 
are
 well
-tolerated
 for their approved uses
, though known 
                                                 2 See
 Section 564(c) of the Federal F
ood, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
 3 FDA notes that the Agency has consulted with BARDA on this matter. On June 15, 2020, BARDA requested that 
FDA revoke this EUA.

 adverse reactions 
may 
include QTc prolongation and ocular, neuropsychiatric, cardiac, and 
hematologic toxicity. 
  Hospitalized patients were likely to have greater prospect of benefit (compared to ambulatory 

patients with mild illness) and c
ould
 be more closely monitored for potential toxicity
, although it 
was recognized that enrollment in a clinical trial would be t
he best option when using these drugs 

so that data on safety and effectiveness could be obtained.
    
FDA therefore concluded,
 based on the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA
 at the 
time
, that 
it 
was
 reasonable to believe that 
CQ and 
HCQ may be effective in treating COVID
-19, and that, when used under the conditions described in 
the
 authorization, the known and potential 
benefits of 
CQ and HCQ 
when used to treat COVID
-19 outweigh the known and potential risks 
of such products
. The EUA was
 authorized at a time when there was widespread use of these 
drugs by physicians to treat COVID
-19 patients
, and when such use
 had presented challenges 
with ensuring adequate drug ava
ilabili
ty for patients 
being treated with these drugs 
for approved 
uses a
s well as adequate drug availability to conduct clinical trials.
    
Similarity of 
CQ and HCQ and Rationale for Inclusion of Both Products in EUA 039
  
CQ and 
HCQ belong to a class of drugs known as 4
-aminoquinolines and both occur as
 enantiomers (R and S is
omers).
 Desethylchloroquine is an immediate downstream product of 
CYP-mediated dealkylation of both drugs, wherea
s desethylhydroxychloroquine is a metabolite 
of only 
HCQ
. Bisdesethylchloroquine is a downstream
 metabolite of both drugs
.11  HCQ 
is 
administered as a sulfate,
 whereas 
CQ is administered as a 
phosphate
 salt. Both drugs are usually 
absorbed in the upper
 intestinal tract. 
 Some studies have
 reported differences in the 
pharmacokinetics
 of 
CQ and 
HCQ in humans;
 however, these differences ca
n be explained by 
differences
 in either the analytical methods applied, the
 sample source used (that is, plasma 
versus whole blood),
 or renal clearance of these drugs
.12 Important to the pharmacokinetic
s, pharmacodynamics
, and toxic properties of these drug
s is their ability to accumulate in acidic 
compartments
 such as lysosomes, as well as inflamed (acidic) tissues.
  The large volume
 of distribution and long half
-lives of these
 drugs can explain some of their clinical characteristics,
 such as their 
slow onset of action and prolonged effects
 after drug discontinuation.
 Both drugs 
are approved 
for the treatment of malaria
 with similar dosing
 and 
both have 
similar adverse

 effects
 such as QT prolongation
.13  While only HCQ has an approved indication for 
chronic 
discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus in adults and the treatment of 
acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults, this is based on NDA submissions to the 
Agency.  Both drugs have been used to treat rheumatologic diseases 
for many years
.14  Thus, for
 the
 purposes of EUA 039 and consideration of data regarding the use of these products for 
COVID
-19, it is reasonable to assume that data regarding one product 
are 
applicable to the other. 
  Review of New Information Relevant to
 Assessing Whether CQ and HCQ
 May be Effective in 
Treating COVID
-19   Clinical Pharmacology Assessment Regarding Dosing
  
Agency
 clinical pharmacology reviewers have re
-assessed the publications relied upon at the 
time of EUA authorization regarding significantly higher lung concentration relative to the in 

vitro EC
50 value
 as the rationale to support 
CQ and 
HCQ as potentially effi
cacious against 
SARS
-CoV
-2 at the dosage suggested in the EUA. The FDA clinical pharmacology reviewers 
cite limitations with these studies
15 including
 that t
he in vitro antiviral EC
50 values reported in 
the literature were extracellular drug concentrations 
present in cell culture media and should be 

compared with in vivo free drug concentration in the plasma (likely to be equal to free 
extracellular tissue concentration). Under the assumption that in vivo cellular accumulation is 
similar to that from the in 
vitro 
cell
-based assays
, the calculated free lung concentrations that 
would result from the EUA suggested dosing regimens are well below the in vitro EC
50/EC
90 values, making the antiviral effect against SARS
-CoV
-2 not likely achievable with the dosing 
reg
imens
 recommended in the EUA
.  The
 substantial increase in dosing that would be needed to 
increase the likelihood of an antiviral effect would not be acceptable due to toxicity concerns.
 The reviewers include the caveat that 
if 
these drugs have 
immunomodul
atory effects that could 
be beneficial in patients with COVID
-19, those 
effects would not be predicated on achieving 
concentrations that exceed the EC
50 value.  
  Although many published papers predict adequate antiviral effect, the majority of these paper
s refer to the methods and findings of the publication with the limitations described above.
 In 

addition, conclusions in the most recent publication 
regarding
 in vitro activity of HCQ and 
achievable concentrations at the site of action are consistent with 
the FDA assessment.
16 Results 
of analyses made available since the EUA was issued
 lead to the conclusion that it is unlikely 
that
 the dosing regimens in the EUA would be able to have an antiviral effect.

 Published Literature Regarding Viral Shedding 
  The Agency has
 reviewed additional published literature becoming available since the EUA was 
issued regarding 
the 
effects of CQ or HCQ on 
viral RNA shedding (see TABLE 
1). The highest 

quality data 
are those 
published by Tang et al. 
from 
a randomized open
-label trial comparing 
HCQ with standard of care alone in 150 hospitalized patients with COVID
-19. The proportion 
with conversion of RT
-PCR specimens obtained from the upper or lower respiratory tract to 
negati
ve by day 28 was similar in both groups at multiple timepoints. Other published studies
, which
 include 
an 
extremely small randomized trial a
s well as
 several observational comparisons
, were 
inconsistent 
with respect to reporting a difference in viral RNA s
hedding comparing HCQ
- or CQ
- treated patients with others who were not treated with either of these medications. 
These 
publications are summarized in

  In summary, although there were two positive reports observing an impact on viral shedding 

available at the time the EUA was issued, this 
observation has not been consistently replicated
. 
The largest randomized controlled trial assessing probability of negative conversion (Tang et al.) 
showed no difference
: the proportion of patients with detectible shedding of viral RNA was very 
similar ove
r time in the group that received HCQ 
when compared to
 the group that did not
.  At 
the time the EUA was issue
d, it was reasonable to assume that an impact on viral shedding 

would be associated with a clinical benefit for patients. 
However, n
either a favora
ble impact of 
CQ or 
HCQ on viral shedding nor an established clinical benefit of a decrease in viral shedding 
has been borne out by data and reports available since the EUA was issued. 
 
 
 U.S. National Treatment Guidelines
  
At the time EUA 039 was authoriz
ed,
 a number of countries initially impacted by COVID
-19 had recommended treatment of patients with COVID
-19 with CQ or 
HCQ in their national 
treatment guidelines
.18  However, 
there were no national treatment guidelines available in the 
U.S.
 This is no long
er the case. 
 On April 11, 2020, 
The 
Infectious Diseases Society of America 
Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID
-19 published 
recommend
ations on
 CQ and 
HCQ in the context of a clinical trial among patients admitted to

  Randomi
zed Evaluation of COVID
-19 Therapy
 RECOVERY Trial (
NCT04381936
)  The RECOVERY
 trial is being 
sponsored by
 Oxford University in the United Kingdom 
in 
collaboration with several foundations and
 British government
 agencies
. It is designed as a
n adaptive
 platform trial
 in hospitalized patients 
with COVID
-19 to assess the effectiveness of trial 
treatments in reducing
 all
-cause mortality within 28 days.
 Treatment arms include: usual care; or 
usual care combined with corticosteroid therapy, lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin, or 
HCQ.  Additional ran
domizations are included between convalescent plasma and placebo and between 

tocilizumab and placebo for eligible patients.  
  
Over 11,000 patients have been enrolled so far, of an estimated target 
enrollment
 of 12,000.  On 

June 5,
 2020, the chief investig
ators announced closure of the 
HCQ arm due to lack of benefit
.22  With 1542 patients randomized to HCQ and 3132 to the usual care comparator, mortality was 
reported as 25.7% and 23.5% respectively (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% CI
 0.98-1.26, p=0.10).
23 The 
difference in mortality rates trends in favor of the usual care comparator. 
No evidence of benefit 
was reported for other outcomes such as hospital length of stay
 or need for mechanical 
ventilation
. These were noted as preliminary results with follow
-up complete for just over 80% 
of participants; the investigators announced ﬁ
These data convincingly rule out any meaningful 
mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID
-19. Full results 
will be made available as soon as possib
le.
ﬂ While the 
HCQ findings in the RECOVERY trial 
were based on a randomized but open label design, the endpoint of mortality is generally less 

susceptible than other more subjectively assessed endpoints to biases that may be of concern 

with such a design.
    Only randomized controlled trials 
can
 answer the question of whether HCQ or CQ is of 
clinical 
benefit in hospitalized patients with COVID
-19, and the RECOVERY Trial results offer 
persuasive evidence of a lack of benefit of HCQ in the treatment of hospi
talized patients with 
COVID
-19.    There are additional trials ongoing in hospitalized patients

criteria for issuance of an EUA are
 more stringent

and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the 
National Institutes of Health. 
ORCHID is a multicenter, blinded, placebo

evaluating HCQ for the treatment of adults hospitalized with COVID
-19. The primary aim is to compare the
 effect 
of HCQ versus placebo on clinical outcomes, measured using the COVID Ordinal Outcomes Scale at Day 15. The 
current planned sample size is 510. Over 400 participants have been enrolled to date. The trial
 has undergone recent

Review of New Information 
on Known and Potential Risks of the 
Products
  
Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology Review of Adverse Events Associated with 
CQ or 
HCQ Use for COVID
-1926  
The FAERS database and literature were searched for adverse events associated with CQ
 or 
HCQ use for COVID
-19, as well as the American Association
 of Poison Control Centers 
(AAPCC) National Poison Data System (NPDS) for calls associated with CQ
 OR H
CQ 
exposure.  
  
As of May 6, 2020, key findings were as follows: 
A total of 347 HCQ and 38 CQ cases were 
identified. 
The majority of the cases (69%) invo
lved males with a median age in the early 60s
. 
Five cases reported HCQ use through the EUA. Of all serious adverse events (cardiac and non
-cardiac), QT prolongation was the most commonly reported adverse event for both HCQ and 

CQ. 
  
There were 109 cases wi
th serious cardiac AEs, some reporting one or more of the following: 80 
(73%) reported QT prolongation, 4 (4%) reported Torsades de Pointes, 14 (13%) reported 

ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, and 25 (23%) had a 

fatal outcome.
 Among the 109 cases, 92 (84%) reported concomitant use of at least one other 
medication that prolongs the QT interval and 75 (69%) reported concomitant use of 

azithromycin.
  
There were 113 cases with serious non
-cardiac AEs. Hepatitis/increas
ed liver 
enzymes/hyperbilirubinemia were the most commonly reported adverse event (59%). These are

acute kidney injury/renal failure (5%). Of note, acute kidney injury ha
s been associated with 
COVID
-19. Methemoglobinemia was reported in 4 cases (4%)
; two of these cases were fatal 
(methemoglobinemia is currently not in the labels for HCQ or CQ).
  
The reviewers were unable to assess the rate
s of these AEs using FAERS data, N
PDS data, and 
literature alone because the total number of persons exposed to either product is unknown.  The 

cardiac adverse events identified 
are serious risks associated with death in some patients.  
On Apri
l 24, 2020, 
FDA issued a 
Drug Safety Communica
tion cautioning against the use of HCQ 
and CQ for COVID
-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart 
rhythm problems
.27  The EUA 039 
Health Care Provider Fact Sheets recommend use with 
caution in patients at increased risk 
for ventricular arr
hythmia, performing a baseline 
electrocardiogram, and monitoring the electrocardiogram during treatment.  
While this 
monitoring can reduce the risk of harm, the risk of cardiac adverse events under the EUA 039 

authorized use remains. Met
hemoglobinemia is an adverse event which was not included in 
labeling for either products
 and is now reported in the setting of COVID
-19.  A recent case series 
described 3 cases of methemoglobinemia occurring in critically ill COVID
-19 patients from a 
sing
le institution

n30  
The CDC Stephen B. Thacker Library of COVID
-19 research articles was searched for articles 
that contain ﬁhydroxychloroquineﬂ or ﬁchloroquineﬂ in the title or abstract and at a minimum had 

the following design features: conducted in a population with confir
med COVID
-19 infection, 
reported quantitative estimates of treatment effectiveness or safety associated with 
HCQ
 or 
CQ use, and included a reference group that was not treated with 
HCQ or 
CQ. The search identified 
317 articles. After excluding non
-observat
ional studies (e.g., RCTs) and studies not designed to 
evaluate HCQ or CQ treatment outcomes in the COVID
-19 population, there were 10 
observational studies eligible for review and 
one 
additional study that had been shared with FDA

COVID

additionally 
evaluated a
 large

hospitalized with COVID

 (Mehra et al

Conclusion
   Since FDA initially authorized CQ and HCQ 
for emergency use 
on March 28, 2020, new 
scientific and clinical
 data
, as well as
 published literature
, have raised questions 
regarding
 whether CQ and HCQ may be effective in treating COVID
-19 and whether CQ and HCQ™s 
known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks associated with 
their
 authorized use. 
FDA has reviewed this information and data as part of its ongoing a
ssessment 
of whether an EUA remains appropriate. 
  Based on 
its review, 
the Agency
 has determined the following: 
   The 
suggested dosing regimens
 for CQ and HCQ as detailed in the Fact Sheets are
 unlikely
 to produce an
 antiviral effect
.  Earlier
 reports
 of 
decreased 
viral shedding
 with 
HCQ or CQ 
treatment
 have not been 
consistently replicated and recent data from a 
randomized controlled 
trial 
assessing 
probability of negative conversion showed no difference
 between HCQ and standard of 
care alone
.   Current 
U.S. treatment gu
idelines do not recommend the use of HCQ or CQ in 

hospitalized patients with COVID
-19 outside of a clinical 
trial
, and the NIH guidelines 
now recommend against such use outside of a clinical trial.
   Recent data from a large
 randomized controlled trial show
ed no evidence of 
benefit
 for 
mortality or other outcomes such as hospital length of stay or need for mechanical 

ventilation
 of HCQ treatment in hospitalized patients with COVID
-19.  Therefore
, based on the totality of scie
ntific 
evidence 
available,
 it is no longer reasonable to 
believe that CQ and HCQ may be effective in treating COVID
-19 for the 
authorized 
uses 
detailed in
 EUA
 039.  Further
, in considering the known safety profile for both CQ and HCQ and 
                                                 32 Mehra

s of serious cardiac adverse events, in addition to 
several new reports 
of 
methemoglobinemia
 in COVID
-19 patients
, it is no longer reasonable to believe that the known 
and potential benefits of CQ and HCQ outweigh the known and potential risks associated 
with
 the authorized use. 
   BARDA
 has received few reports from healthcare providers and/or provider designee
s detailing 
outcome data as requested in the EUA. Interpretation of 
these 
data is limited due to the low 

number of patients with a reported outcome
 and the 
absence of a comparison group.
 A review of 
recent published literature 
describing observational studies
 does not provide informative findings 

given 
residual confounding and other methodological issues. 
  
Based on the above, 
FDA
 concludes 
that the criteria for Emergency Use Authorization as 

outlined in Section 564(c)(2) 
of the FD&C Act 
are no longer met and 
is revoking 
EUA 
039 for
 CQ and 
HCQ
