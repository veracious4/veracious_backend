However, I was on the conference calls last week regarding the furlough and I was truly amazed.
 My DM assured us with a candidacy I hadn't expected, that she even felt Ulta was doing everything they could to do right by their employees.
 Then, this afternoon, I saw that Sephora did to their employees and I was so shocked - they furloughed them with no notice (please correct me if the tweet I saw was incorrect).
 In comparison, Ulta gave their employees two weeks to prepare themselves and file for unemployment, they offered any info and knowledge they could pass along, and management was encouraged to check in and follow up with furloughed employees.
 They kept employees on who they knew would not benefit from filing for unemployment, so it wasn't just managers, but upper level stylists as well.
 Also, and this is what impressed me the most, was that in the line they drew of who to and not to furlough, there were 18 employees in the entire company who would have been negatively impacted by this change and they were going to find the best course of action to make sure they, too, were taken care of.
 Needed to say, the frustrations I'd been stewing on for the weeks had been called and I'm interested to see how we will adjust to this new normal when we all go back.
 I just thought it was worth sharing.Disclaimer: I'm, obviously, an Ulta store employee, but I wasn't encouraged by anyone from the company to post this, just my fiance who was also impressed by all this.

 I am pleasantly surprised at how this was handled.
 This whole situation sucks and no ones coming out of this a winner but I feel like their actions as a company definitely lessened the blow for all of uslevel 12 points · 6 months agoWhere did you see news about Sephora??
 I am happy they paid us while they did, and didn't fire us like Sephora did to their employees.
 I know that 99% of us furloughed will benefit and make more, but for someone like me who needs the money from the 2nd job, but doesn't qualify for unemployment, it stinks.
 But I am glad that when this is all over I will still have my position and original start date (going on 6 years).
 I definitely think they did us right unlike what sephora did to their people.level 212 points · 6 months agodouble check your states unemployment benefits!
 i live in cali and we can access partial unemployment if we lose hours or lose one of our two jobs.
 idk where you live but it’s very likely your states UI is being expanded because of covid, it couldn’t hurt to apply anyways and see.level 2Beauty Advisor4 points · 6 months agoAgreeing with other comment, check your state, most times you can file for unemployment with a lost income, even if it didn't make up your entire personal income.
 Losing one of two jobs is still job loss.level 11 point · 6 months agoHow do you know there were 18 employees who weren't furloughed and how did they decide that?level 11 point · 6 months agoProud from a Corp standpoint.
 I’ve been sick with the virus and felt reassured that precautions were in place, and that ALL employees are considered in EVeRY decisionView Entire Discussion (13 Comments)More posts from the Ulta communityContinue browsing in r/Ultar/UltaWelcome to Ulta7.5kMembers100OnlineCreated Mar 10, 2014JoinhelpReddit AppReddit coinsReddit premiumReddit giftsaboutcareerspressadvertiseblogTermsContent policyPrivacy policyMod policyReddit Inc © 2020.

 I woke up to a message about the call with 30 minutes to prepare for it, and while I am still nervous about how long the pay/stay-at-home orders will last I am very proud to work for Ulta.
 Also from a consumer perspective, even I'm paying attention to companies who are taking care of their employees and I'll continue to take it into consideration as I shop myself!
 I know there’s been a lot of criticism regarding their lack of communication at times, and even criticisms of how long it took them to finally close down retail stores.
 But I feel that the extra time they’ve taken to really hash out all of the little details that has let them take care of their employees so well.
 They made sure they had the catastrophe pay figured out before closing, and took the time to let us know before the 3rd week closed that we would still be paid through the 18th, and then even made sure to let us know that we should all qualify for Unemployment and that the CARES act would actually help us make more than we typically would.
 I am happy they paid us while they did, and didn't fire us like Sephora did to their employees.
