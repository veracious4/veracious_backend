This trend has coincided with a transition towards diets linked to a rising prevalence of obesity and non-communicable diseases in many countries.1 Among food processing classification systems investigating this phenomenon the most prominent is NOVA, which groups foods into four categories according to the extent and purpose of industrial processing involved.2One such category is ultra-processed foods, defined as “formulations of food substances often modified by chemical processes and then assembled into ready-to-consume hyper-palatable food and drink products using flavours, colours, emulsifiers and .

 These findings follow a previous study7 and a linked editorial8 reporting an association between consumption of these foods and an increased risk of cancer.The study by Srour and colleagues (doi:10.1136/bmj.l1451) reports an association between an absolute 10% increase in dietary ultra-processed food and significantly higher rates of overall cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease.
 Sensitivity analyses reveal further associations for specific groups of ultra-processed food, including beverages, fats and sauces, meats, sugary products, and salty snacks.
 Secondary analysis shows a statistically significant association between unprocessed or minimally processed foods and lower risks of all reported disease outcome measures.5 The study by Rico-Campà and colleagues (doi:10.1136/bmj.l1949) finds a positive dose-response association between consumption of ultra-processed foods and all cause mortality.
