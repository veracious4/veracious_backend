Page 2 of 8(N=24,808) participating in the NHANES 2001-2010 were merged to 
increase sample size [25,26]. Excluded from the analyses were those 
individuals with dietary records judged to be incomplete by the 
National Center for Health Statistics sta˛ (n=147) andˆfemales who 

were pregnant or lactating (n=1,128). ˚is secondary analysis was 
without individual identi˜ers; therefore, no Institutional Review Board 
review was required [27].Demographics and dietary information
Demographic information was determined from the NHANES 
interview administered in the Mobile Examination Center [28]. Intake 
data were obtained from What We Eat in America which collected an 
in-person 24-hour dietary recall interview and a telephone 24-hour 
dietary recall conducted three to ten days later. Both types of recalls 

was administered using an automated multiple-pass method [29,30]. 

Detailed descriptions of the dietary interview methods are provided in 
the NHANES Dietary Interviewers Procedure Manuals [31,32].˚e USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) [33] single food code was used to identify fresh pear 

consumers were 63137010. Individuals were classi˜ed as consumers 
if any amount of fresh pear was ingested either day of the recall. For 
each participant, daily total energy and nutrient intakes from foods 

and beverages were obtained from the total nutrient intake ˜les of the 
FNDDS associated with each data release. ˚e Vitamin D Addendum 
to USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 3.0 [34] was 
used to determine vitamin D intake. Intake from supplements was not 
considered.Diet quality as determined by the healthy eating index (HEI-

2010)˚e HEI-2010 was used to determine diet quality [35,36]. ˚e HEI is composed of 12 sub-components; the total HEI score is the sum of 
the sub-component scores and has a maximum value of 100 points. A 

higher score correlates with higher compliance to the DGA. Nine of 

the sub-components address nutrient adequacy. ˚e remaining three 
sub-components assess re˜ned grains, sodium, and empty calories, 
which should be limited. ˚e SAS code used to calculate HEI-2010 total 
score and sub-component scores was downloaded from the Center for 
Nutrition Policy and Promotion website [37].Anthropometric and physiologic measures
˚e NHANES protocols were used to determine height, weight, and waist circumference (WC) [38]. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters) squared [39]. Overweight was de˜ned as a BMI between 25 and 29.9, whereas obesity was de˜ned as a BMI ˇ 30 [39]. High waist WC was de˜ned as >102 cm (males) or >88 cm (females). Systolic (SBP) and 
diastolic blood pressures (DBP) were determined using the standard 

NHANES protocol [40]. High density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was determined on non-fasted individuals [41] while LDL-C [42], triglycerides [42], blood glucose [43], and insulin [43] were determined 
on only fasted subjects. ˚e homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels were calculated using insulin x glucose 
(mg/dL)/405 [44,45]. Other tests were also done via NHANES standard 
protocols: C-reactive protein [45], serum folate [46], and folate red blood cell [46]. Not all individuals had laboratory values for all tests.Metabolic syndrome was de˜ned using the National Heart Lung 
and Blood Institute Adult Treatment Panel III criteria [47]; that is 

having 3 or more of the following risk factors: abdominal obesity, WC>102 cm (males), >88 cm (females); hypertension, SBP ˇ130 
mmHg or DBP ˇ85 mmHg or taking anti-hypertensive medications; 

HDL-C, <40 mg/dL (males), <50 mg/dL (females); high triglycerides, 
ˇ150 mg/dL or taking anti-hyperlipidemic medications; high fasting 
glucose, ˇ110 mg/dL or taking insulin or other hypoglycemic agents. 
Participants with any missing values were excluded from the analyses.Statistical analyses
Sampling weights and the primary sampling units and strata information, as provided by NHANES [25,26], were included in all 
analyses using SUDAAN v11.0 (Research Triangle Institute; Raleigh, 

NC). Least-square means (and the standard errors of the least-square 
means) were calculated using PROC REGRESS of SUDAAN. For dietary ˜ber and micronutrients, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Method 
[48] was used to estimate usual intake (UI) of selected nutrients in for 
assessment of nutrient adequacy. Since nutrients are consumed daily 
by most people, the one part model was used. ˚e NCI SAS macros (Mixtran v1.1 and Distrib v1.1) were used to generate parameter e˛ects a˝er covariate adjustments and to estimate the distribution of usual intake via Monte Carlo simulation methods, respectively [48]. 

Covariates in this study were day of the week of the 24-hr recall [coded 
as weekend (Friday-Sunday) or weekday (Monday-˚ursday)] and 
sequence of dietary recall (˜rst or second). So˝ware provided by NCI was used with the two days of intake using one-day sampling weights 
to obtain appropriate variance estimates. Balanced repeated replication 
(BRR) was performed to obtain standard errors (SE) and con˜dence 

intervals (CI) for the percentiles; BRR weights were constructed with 
Fay adjustment factor M=0.3 (perturbation factor 0.7) and further 
adjusted to match the initial sample weight totals within speci˜c age/
gender/ethnicity groupings for the full dataset. ˚e Dietary Reference 
Intake (DRI) age groups [49] were used to present nutrient adequacy for 
each of the nutrients studied. Di˛erences among pear consumers and 

non-consumers among the two groups were determined by computing 
population Z statistics generated from UI variables. ˚e percent of the 
population below Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) or above the 

Adequate Intake (AI) [49] among pear consumers and non-consumers 
was similarly examined. Linear regression was used to determine di˛erences between fresh pear consumers and non-consumers for nutrients, HEI-2010 total and sub-component scores, and physiologic measures. Logistic regression was used to determine if fresh pear consumers had a lower odds ratio 
of being overweight or obese or having other adverse physiologic outcomes. For all linear and logistic regressions, covariates were age, 
gender, ethnicity, poverty index ratio (one of three levels: 0-1.25, 1.25-
3.5, ˇ3.5) [28], physical activity level (one of three levels: sedentary, 
moderate, and vigorous) [50], current smoking status, and alcohol consumption, which was obtained from the 24-hour dietary recall. 

Energy (kcals) was used for regressions in the nutrient analyses except when kcals were the dependent variable. Energy was also not used as a covariate in the HEI-2010 analyses, since HEI-2010 controls for energy. 

Body Mass Index was used as a covariate in the biophysical variable linear regressions except when the dependent variable was body weight, BMI, or WC. For linear regression analysis and comparison of Z values a p<0.01 was used; however, for the logistic analysis a p value of <0.05 was considered signi˜cant.Results
Demographics and fresh pear consumption
Adult consumers of fresh pears were less likely to non-Hispanic  Page 3 of 8black (~ 6.5 percentage units less), more likely to be older (~7 years older), less likely current-smokers (~14 percentage units less), and 
consumed less alcohol (about 5 g less) than non-consumers (Table 1). 
Mean consumption of fresh pears among consumers was 169.5 g ± 6.6 
g.Energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake
Adult consumers of fresh pears had similar mean energy intakes, 9104 ± 222 kJ (2176 kcal) vs 9113 ± 38 kJ (2178 kcal), compared to 
non-consumers (Table 2). Adult pear consumers also had lower daily mean intakes of total fat (~7 g or 8.6% less), monounsaturated fatty 

acids (~3 g or 9.2% less), saturated fatty acids (~4 g or 13.7% less), and 
added sugar (~3 tsp eq or 17% less), and higher mean daily intakes of dietary ˜ber (~49.7% more) and total sugars (~8.6% more) compared to non-consumers (Table 2).Adult consumers of fresh pears also had higher UI of vitamin C (~17 mg or 19.6% more) compared to non-consumers (Table 3a). Adult consumers had higher daily UI of magnesium (~40 mg 13.6% 
more), copper (~0.25 mg or 19.6% more), and magnesium (~36 mg 
or 11% more) compared to non-consumers (Table 3a). In addition, 
consumers of fresh pears had higher intakes of dietary ˜ber (~9 g or 

36% more) and potassium (~280 mg or 10.4% more) (Table 3b).Dietary adequacy
Compared to non-consumers, a signi˜cantly lower percentage of 
adult fresh pear consumers had vitamin A (~29 percentage units less), 
vitamin C (~23 percentage units less), copper (~4 percentage units 
less), and magnesium (~13 percentage units less) below their EAR 

(Table 3a). Further, a signi˜cantly lower percentage of adult fresh pear 

consumers had intakes for dietary ˜ber (~29 percentage units less) 
above their AI (Table 3b).Diet quality (healthy eating index-2010)
Adult fresh pear consumers had higher diet quality (~12 units, 26% higher) compared to non-consumers. ˚e increased HEI-2010 score 
was driven by better scores for HEI-2010 subcomponents: Greens and 
Beans (0.6 units, 55% higher), Total Fruit (2 units, 91% higher), Whole 
Fruit (2.5 units, 125% higher), Whole Grains (1 unit, 48% higher), 
Seafood and Plant Protein (0.5 units, 26% higher), Fatty Acid Ratio 
(0.9 units, 18% higher), Sodium (0.7 units, 17% higher), and Empty 
Calories (3.4 units, 33% higher) (Table 4). For Sodium and Empty 
Calories higher scores denote lower intakes.Anthropometric and physiologic measures
Adult consumers of fresh pears had lower weights (3.6 kg) than non-consumers (Table 5) and were 35% less likely to be obese than 

non-consumers (p=0.0097) (Table 6). No other physiologic measures 
varied between consumers and non-consumers.Discussion
˚is is the ˜rst published study that has examined fresh pear consumption in adults and shown its bene˜cial e˛ects on nutrient intake, nutrient adequacy, diet quality, and body weight. On any given 
day, approximately 2% of the adult population consumed fresh pears, 

with the average consumption of approximately 170 g/day; this equates to 1 medium pear [20], an amount slightly above the reference amount customarily consumed of 140 g [51], or 1 cup equivalent. ˚us, those 

consuming fresh pears met one half of the fruit recommendation for 

most adults [3]. ˚is is important since the overwhelming majority 
of adults do not meet the recommendation for fruit consumption 
[4,5]. Consumption of fresh pears had a positive e˛ect on nutrient 
intake since consumers had higher UI intakes of dietary ˜ber, vitamin 
C, magnesium, copper, and potassium, and higher mean intakes of 
total sugars; consumers of fresh pears also had lower intakes of total, 
monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and added sugars. 
Consumption was also associated with higher diet quality and lower body weight than that seen in non-consumers. Comparison of macronutrients suggested more favorable lipid intakes in fresh pear consumers than in non-consumers, presumably due to the low lipid content of fresh pears [20]. Both consumers 
and non-consumers had mean fat intakes within the Acceptable 
Macronutrient Distribution Range of 20-35% of energy, set by the 
Institute of Medicine [52]; however, non-consumers were near the 
upper range with a mean intake of 34% of energy. Mean MUFA and SFA were lower in consumers which support rat studies which showed VariablePear Consumers (n=492)Non-Pear Consumers (n=24,316)PLSM ± SE1LSM ± SE% Female53.89 ± 2.7950.80 ± 0.350.2725Ethnicity    % Non-Hispanic White67.60 ± 3.4371.46 ± 1.430.0299 % Non-Hispanic Black4.89 ± 0.9511.43 ± 0.77<0.0001 % Mexican American12.90 ± 2.287.74 ± 0.710.0308Age (years)53.27 ± 1.1446.34 ± 0.25<0.0001Poverty Index Ratio3.21 ± 0.123.01 ± 0.030.1155Physical Activity    % Sedentary Physical Activity24.27 ± 2.6129.06 ± 0.620.0735 % Moderate Physical Activity41.15 ± 3.3233.98 ± 0.460.0322 % Vigorous Physical Activity34.58 ± 3.2436.96 ± 0.730.4727% Current Smoker10.53 ± 1.9824.49 ± 0.55<0.0001Alcohol Intake (g)5.68 ± 0.8411.12 ± 0.34<0.0001Pear Consumption (g)169.5 ± 6.6--- Differences assessed using Z-Score.1LSM: Least Square Means; SE: Standard Error.Table 1:

Page 5 of 8the highest level were not consumed by NHANES participants.Another important ˜nding of this study was that, although total 
sugar intake was higher in fresh pear consumers when compared to non-consumers, added sugars were lower. One serving of fresh pears contains approximately 16 grams of total sugar, with approximately 66% fructose [20]. ˚e role of fructose in weight management and 
weight gain is controversial. Recently, a systematic review and meta-
analysis of fructose feeding trials showed that many of the studies were 
of poor quality, but in isocaloric trials, fructose did not contribute 
to weight gain when compared with other carbohydrates [55]. More 

studies are needed.Dietary ˜ber and potassium have been identi˜ed as nutrients of public health concerns; vitamin C and magnesium have been identi˜ed as shortfall nutrients [1]. Fresh pears are an excellent source [56] of dietary ˜ber; the UI of dietary ˜ber among pear consumers was approximately equal to the DV [57] and intake was re˙ected in better 
nutrient adequacy for dietary ˜ber than seen in non-consumers. Fresh 

pears contain both soluble and insoluble ˜ber [58]; a recent review 
has shown that the dietary ˜ber in pears is ~30% soluble and ~70% insoluble [59]. In general, soluble ˜bers have positive e˛ects on serum 

lipid levels [60,61] and glycemic control [62] and insoluble ˜bers have 
positive e˛ects on laxation [63]. Our study did not show di˛erences 

in lipid levels or markers of glycemic control; perhaps the amount of soluble ˜ber consumed was too low to see a response or the UI of ˜ber; although mean ˜ber consumption among consumers in this study 

nearly met the daily value of 25 g [64], did not re˙ect long term intake 

that would have a˛ected lipid or blood glucose levels. It is also possible 
that ˜ber intake was not high enough to a˛ect these CVRF [62]. Population studies have shown that high intake of dietary ˜ber is inversely related to the incidence [65] or risk [66,67] of stroke. Few 
studies have looked at the relationship between speci˜c types of fruit 
and stroke [67]; however, this association has been studied explicitly 
for pears and the botanically related apple, and pears may contribute to 
protection against stroke [16,17,68-70]. It is not clear if the dietary ˜ber 

content of pears is associated with protection against stroke, although dietary ˜ber intake has been inversely related to high blood pressure, VariableConsumersNon-Consumers LSM ± SELSM ± SEPHEI-2010 Total Score58.8 ± 1.246.7 ± 0.2<0.0001 Component 1 (Total Vegetables)3.2 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.020.2619 Component 2 (Greens and Beans)1.7 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.020.001 Component 3 (Total Fruit)4.2 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.03<0.0001 Component 4 (Whole Fruit)4.5 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.03<0.0001 Component 5 (Whole Grains)3.1 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.040.0001 Component 6 (Dairy)4.8 ± 0.34.9 ± 0.10.67 Component 7 (Total Protein Foods)4.2 ± 0.14.1 ± 0.010.8439 Component 8 (Seafood and Plant Protein)2.4 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.020.0025 Component 9 (Fatty Acid Ratio)5.8 ± 0.24.9 ± 0.040.0002 Component 10 (Sodium)4.9 ± 0.24.2 ± 0.040.00396.5 ± 0.35.9 ± 0.10.0351 Component 12 (Empty Calories)13.7 ± 0.410.3 ± 0.1<0.0001Data source: Participants 19 years and older of the NHANES 2001-2010.1Adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, poverty income ratio, physical activity, smoker

Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol.Table 6: Risk of overweight and obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic 
syndrome risk factors in adults among consumers pears, when compared with 

non-consumers. Page 6 of 8which is associated with reduced risk of stroke [71]. Our study did not show that fresh pear consumers had lower systolic or diastolic blood pressure than non-consumers, so any potential e˛ect on stroke is unknown. A previous NHANES study has shown that dietary ˜ber may be associated with lower weight in adults [72]. Since there was no 

di˛erence in energy intake or level of physical activity between the 
fresh pear consumption and non-consumption groups, the ˜ber intake may have driven the lower body weights which were seen in this study. 
˚e HEI-2010 has been shown to be a valid and reliable [35]. Mean HEI-2010 total scores, and most component scores, in fresh pear 

consumers were signi˜cantly higher than non-consumers suggesting 
that pears contributed to an overall healthy diet. Only the component 
scores for dairy, total protein foods, and re˜ned grains were not higher 
among pear consumers, suggesting an overall healthier diet among fresh pear consumers. It should be noted however, that neither group had an especially high total score and some of the component scores 
could be misleading. For example, the component score for greens and 
beans for fresh pear consumers was only 1.7 and for non-consumers, it was 1.1, suggesting that improvements could be made by both groups. Fresh pear consumers did, however, have much higher total and whole 
fruit components than non-consumers, suggesting that they may come close to meeting their fruit recommendation [3]. ˚e principal strength of this study was that it was nationally representative. ˚e study did have several weaknesses. ˚e sample 
size (number of adult pear consumers) while acceptable for these analyses, was small in terms of large epidemiologic studies. Further, 
24-hour dietary recalls have several inherent limitations: they depend on memory and subjects may under- or over-report some or certain types of foods. ˚e possibility of misclassifying someone as a fresh 

pear consumer or non-consumer is also a possibility. Results were also dependent on USDA nutrient content. While numerous covariates were used in regression analyses, residual confounding may still exist 
and as such associations reported may also be due to other unknown di˛erences in consumers and non-consumers. Finally, the NHANES is a cross-sectional study, and the data cannot be used to draw causal 
relationships.Summary and Conclusions
Fresh pear consumption among adults is 169.5 g/day. Fresh pears contributed to ˜ber (21% DV) and vitamin C (12% DV) intake 
among adult consumers. Adult pear consumers, as compared to 
non-consumers, had higher dietary intake and lower prevalence of 
inadequacy for dietary ˜ber, vitamin C, potassium, and magnesium and 
lower prevalence of inadequacy for vitamin A. Adult pear consumers, 
as compared to non-consumers, had higher diet quality. Adult pear 
consumers had a lower body weight and were less likely to be obese as 

compared to non-consumers. ˚ese data suggest that consumption of 
fresh pears should be encouraged as part of an overall healthy diet [2], 

since pears are nutrient-dense and can help individuals meet the fruit 
recommendation. Additional studies are needed to determine e˛ects 
on speci˜c CVRF.AcknowledgementThis work is a publication of the USDA/ARS Children™s Nutrition Research
