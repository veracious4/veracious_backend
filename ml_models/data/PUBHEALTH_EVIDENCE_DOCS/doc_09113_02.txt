 However, low bioavailability and photodegradation of curcumin hampers its overall therapeutic efficacy.
 Anionic polymerization method was employed for the preparation of apolipoprotein-E3 mediated curcumin loaded poly(butyl)cyanoacrylate nanoparticles (ApoE3-C-PBCA) and characterized for size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, photostability, morphology, and in vitro release study.ApoE3-C-PBCA were found to be effective against SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells compared to curcumin solution (CSSS) and curcumin loaded PBCA nanoparticles (C-PBCA) from in vitro cell culture investigations.
 Flow cytometry techniques employed for the detection of anticancer activity revealed enhanced activity of curcumin against SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with ApoE3-C-PBCA compared to CSSS and C-PBCA, and apoptosis being the underlying mechanism.
