Notes and definitions A publicly funded clinic
 is a site that offers contraceptive services to the general pu
blicand uses public funds (e.g., federal, state or local funding though programs such as Title X,
Medicaid or the federally qualified health c
enter program) to provide free or reduced-fe
eservices to at least some clients. Sites must serve at least 10 contraceptive clients pe
r year.These sites are operated by a diverse range of provider agencies, including public h
ealthdepartments, Planned Parenthood affiliates, hospitals, federally qualified health cent
ers(FQHCs) and other independent organizations. In this report, these sites 
are primarilyreferred to as ﬁclinicsﬂ; other Guttmacher In
stitute reports may 
use the synonymous termﬁcenter.ﬂA Title XŒfunded clinic is a site that receives federal funding from the Title X
 national familyplanning program.A female contraceptive client is a woman who made at least one initial or subseque
nt visitfor contraceptive services during the 12-month reporting perio
d covered by this datacollection effort. This includes all women who re
ceived a medical examination related to theprovision of a contraceptive method, made supply-related return visits, re
ceivedcontraceptive counseling and a method prescription but defe
rred the medical examination,or chose nonmedical contraceptive methods, even if a medical examination was not
performed, as long as a chart was maintained.
Women in need of publicly funded contraceptive services
 are those women wh
o a) areyounger than 20 or are poor or low-income (i.e., have a family income less than 250% of thefederal poverty level) and b) are sexually active and able to become pregnant but do
 notwant to become pregnant. In the maps, the number of women in need of publicly fund
edcontraceptive services is shown per 100 square miles, calculated using da
ta fromGuttmacher™s Contraceptive Needs and Services

 Methodology Clinics and clients served. We estimated the total number of women who receiv
ed publicly supported contraceptive care in 2015 using multiple sources. To estimate contraceptive clients
 served at publicly supported clinics,
 we collected service data for 2015 for all agencies and 
clinics that provided publicly funded family planning servic
es in the 50 states and the
 District of Columbia, and we used similar methodology and definitions
 as those used in previous surveys.
1,3,4 For each clinic, we collected the total
 number of female contraceptive clients served 
in 2015, the number of those client
s who were younger than age 20 and clinics™ Title X funding status. We obtained clinic
 and client data from s
everal federal sources. We received data for a large proportion of
 all clinics with Title X funding from the Office of Population Affairs (OPA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Servic
es. We received data for all FQHCs from the Health 
Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). We received data from the Indian Health  Guttmacher Institute 
3  Service (IHS) for all IHS sites. The HRSA data were at the agency, not individual clinic, level, 
and we contacted each FQHC agency to obtain information on which specific sites provided 

contraceptive services and how to distribute the agency total among sites. For some FQHCs, 
data were also received from other federal (OPA or IHS) or agency-level sources, and this 
information was used to facilitate distribution of data among the appropriate sites. In other 

cases, no additional information was received, and FQHC agency-level data from HRSA were 

distributed evenly across sites that had been confirmed as providing contraceptive care.  

 
For sites that do not report to these federal sources, we requested data from either state-level 
reporting entities (typically state health department
s) or from the individual organizations that 
administer one or several clinics. In total, we received data for 90% of the 10,708 clinics known 

to be providing publicly funded contraceptive services in 2015. For the 10% of clinics for which 

no 2015 data were received, we estimated the number of contraceptive clients as either the 

number that were served by that clinic in 
2010 (461 sites) or by imputing a number based on the 
number of women served by sim
ilar clinics (according to type and funding status) in a similar 
area (according to region and population density; 605 sites). 

 
In addition to women served at clinics, many wom
en went to private physicians for services that 
are supported by public dollars (typically Medica
id). To estimate the number of women receiving 
Medicaid-funded contraceptive services from 
private physicians, we used information on 
payment and source of care for contracept
ive services reported by respondents to the 2011Œ
2015 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG).
5    Numbers of unintended events averted. We estimated the numbers of unintended pregnancies, unplanned births and abortions that were averted by the provision of publicly 

funded contraceptive care in 2015 using a met
hodology similar to that used for previous estimates.6 We began with the number of women who 
received publicly supported contraceptive 
care in 2015. We examined the current mix of contraceptive methods used by these women and 
compared it with a hypothetical mix of contraceptive methods that would likely be used by these 
same women in the absence of publicly funded care. To calculate this hypothetical mix, we used 

the 2011Œ2015 NSFG to look at the mix of methods currently used by similar women who did 

not obtain publicly supported care in the prior 12 months but who were in need of publicly 

funded contraceptive services (see definition above).  
 We calculated the number of unintended pregnancies that would have occurred among each 

group (the group currently using publicly funded 
services and the hypothetical group without 
access to publicly funded care), based on the current and hypothetical method mix for each 

group and updated failure rates
7 for each method. We adjusted the proportion of contraceptive 
failures expected among method users to be consistent with actual national numbers of 
unintended pregnancies occurring among contraceptive users. We then estimated the additional 

pregnancies that would have occurred in the absence of services by subtracting the number of 

unintended pregnancies expected to occur among actual service users from the number of 

unintended pregnancies expected among the hypothetical group. From this we estimated the 

annual number of unintended pregnancies that were prevented per 1,000 contraceptive clients 
and applied this to all contraceptive clients served. Finally, we classified the unintended 
pregnancies averted according to observed outcomes at the national level for specific 

subgroups of women. Overall, 47% of unintended pregnancies result in an unplanned birth, 34% 

in an abortion and 19% in a miscarriage; these percentages vary slightly for poor and low-

income women and for teens.5,8    Guttmacher Institute
