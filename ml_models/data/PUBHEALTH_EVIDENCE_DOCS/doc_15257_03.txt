 Parental Consent and Notification Laws             If you're under 18, you may or may not have to tell a parent in order to get an abortion — it all depends on the laws where you live.
 Some states don't have any laws about telling your parents or getting their permission.
 But some states say you have to get permission from a parent or older family member to have an abortion.
 Other states don’t make you get permission, but your parents will have to know that you’re getting an abortion.
 You may be able to get a judge's permission to have an abortion without telling your parents.
 This is called "judicial bypass".
 The exact rules are different in different places.
 Find information on parental involvement in your state below.
 You’re not alone.
 If you’re pregnant and want to have an abortion, call your nearest Planned Parenthood health center as soon as possible.
 They can help explain the laws in your state, let you know what your options are, and give you tips on talking with your parents.
 It's important to take action right away.
 Abortion is very safe, but there are more risks the longer you wait.
 There are also time limits on abortion in some states.
 And if you need a judicial bypass, it can take a while to get through the process.
