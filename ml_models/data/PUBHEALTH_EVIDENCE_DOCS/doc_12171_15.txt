 Not only do I feel safe in my home, there are plenty of parks and trails nearby to take my dog on a walk.
 While I am not too big into nightlife so it&apos;s not a concern, there is not a &apos;hit spot in town&apos;, but we are only a 20 minute drive to Dallas!

 My son started in 2nd grade, from a private school.
 He was pre-k reading and 1st grade math.
 They caught him up to mid 2nd grade (3.5 years) in 1 year and at level math before he hit 3rd grade.
 \n\nMy daughter is special needs and with the fabulous teachers you can barely tell she has Aspies anymore and her self esteem, thus academics have skyrocketed!
 \n\nI can say nothing negative at all!!!

 The counselors and teachers are the same way: seemingly laid back, but they set high expectations, and hold the students accountable without compromise.
 So while you will feel immediately accepted, there is no room for lack of discipline or focus.
 The working world will treat the new college graduates the same way, so might as well instill good habits and focused goals early on with the middle school kids, before they get distracted by other aspects of life.
 Otto promotes a good balance between academics, overall fitness, and affinity for music and the arts.

 One of the reasons why I believe so is that it really prepared me for college.
 The school provided AP classes, which really helped me work on my study habits and prepare for college.
 It also provided different levels of classes so that each student didn't feel left out no matter what their intelligence level was.
 PESH is also a great campus and most teachers truly care about their students succeeding.

 NDAA made us so welcome and the girls made friends immediately.
 We love the teachers and how engaged they are with our children.
 I was particularlyinterested in smaller class sizes because there is a high engagement with the teacher and the student.
 They offer music classes and choir as well and they have excellent music teachers.
 \n\nWe have been very happy with NDAA and would highly recommend any parent considering private school to set up an appointment.
 If you are concerned with installing Christian values, an excellent education and a school that truly cares, NDAA does an exceptional job.

 Paul is a diamond in the rough.
 The sense of community once you belong, is overwhelming heartwarming.
 It's a small, but mighty school.

 The community is close, the policemen and firemen are always available and easily accessible, there tons of small businesses coming and going.
 If I could choose to live here again I would.
 However, my only complaint is that the area's ethnic and political diversity is very small.
 A good portion of the are is white and conservative.
 I believe that an are should consist of an equal mix of conservatives and liberals.
 With the area being in Texas, the area's current ethnic and political statistics are not of any surprise.
 With that said, compared to everywhere else in the country, I personally feel that this area is definitely one of the best places for people who want to be involved in a tight knit community and want to live in a small town with a touch of the big city.
 They sit on the edge of my neighborhood everyday.
 They are quick to respond to calls.
 Police department is exceptionally great in Richardson.
 We always have a good neighborhood watch group.
 Even though the creek is a very popular place to take pictures, not only in Richardson but cities around.
 It really needs some extra cleaning with the trash and moving sticks that stop up the waterfall.
 Police is great but could still be a bit more proactive.
 There are many great local restaurants, coffee shops, and other businesses.
 The parks are nice for playing with children, walking dogs, having a picnic, or just relaxing.
 Arapaho has many families, but also people older and younger.
 It is a nice place to walk around, and the neighborhood schools are nice.
 The proximity to the city is great!
 's definition of this crime, use caution when comparing to other locations.
 This company had taught me true team work and how to be a better team player.
 If it was not for my managers, my leadership skills would not be at its greatest as it is now.
 My peers have not only been the best coworkers, but also my greatest friends.
 They have taught the value of friendship and the chemistry of team work.
 Overall, Fossil is a great job for those who are seeking how to get hands on with customer care and service!
 They are caring and really look out for every employee.
 The pay is great with annual raises and fabulous health insurance!
 The best part of working for such an AMAZING company, is the fact that they value their employees work\u002Flife balance.
 On weekends, I am ACTUALLY off of work.
 I love it!
