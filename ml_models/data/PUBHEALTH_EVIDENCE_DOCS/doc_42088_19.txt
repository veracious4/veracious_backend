 Trump’s Flu Shot Reticence           May 15, 2020      President Donald Trump cast doubt on the value of influenza vaccines, saying he only got a flu shot because he was required to as president.
 “I don’t know if I should have.
 Who knows?” But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says each year the vaccine saves thousands of lives and prevents tens of thousands of hospitalizations.
 No Evidence That Flu Shot Increases Risk of COVID-19           April 27, 2020      A claim being pushed on social media and by an organization skeptical of vaccines is using a military study to falsely suggest that the flu vaccine increases someone’s risk of contracting COVID-19.
 No Evidence New York Legislator Died from Flu Shot           December 7, 2018      A self-described “alternative news” story suggests the flu shot was responsible for the death of a New York state senator.
 The official cause of death is still pending.
