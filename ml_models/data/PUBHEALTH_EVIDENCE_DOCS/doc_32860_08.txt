A lot of hairstylists swear on their hair-dryers that it is awful for your hair.
 Supposedly, it coats your hair with plastic or wax to make it seem smooth, soft, and shiny, instead of really moisturizing your hair.
 It also reportedly makes your scalp itchy and hair fall out.
 However, I‚Äôve been using the Pantene Restoratives shampoo and conditioner for a few months now, and I find my hair less frizzy, more manageable, smoother, and softer.
 Of course, I also use John Frieda Anti-Frizz Serum and Pantene Pro-V Restoratives Frizz Control Ultra Smoothing Balm (I highly recommend the latter, just apply to wet hair).
 Phew, that was long.
 So, my question is: Is Pantene good or bad for my hair?
 The Beauty Brains respond: Sophie, please don‚Äôt fall into the trap of believing everything your stylist tells you.
 (That‚Äôs one of the The Beauty Brains Basic Beliefs.)
 While most stylists are very talented at cutting and styling hair, they‚Äôre not very talented at interpreting cosmetic formulations.
 The truth is, Pantene‚Äôs shampoo and conditioner formulas are believed to be among the best in the industry by those of us in the cosmetic science side of the business.
 It makes sense if you think about it.
 P&amp;G, makers of Pantene, have a HUGE research budget.
 Certainly larger than any salon company.
 That means they can afford to dedicate resources to developing and testing the best formulas possible.
 We‚Äôve seen Pantene formulas beat the pants of salon products in blind consumer testing.
 (The products are hidden or blinded, not the consumers) Why is Pantene vilified?
 So why do stylists say that Pantene coats the hair with plastic, or make it fall out?
 Because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre told by the sales representatives for the salon companies.
 And the truth is, it‚Äôs just not true!
 Compare the ingredient lists for Pantene conditioner and any salon brand you can find.
 There‚Äôs nary a plastic to be found in Pantene.
 And no, it doesn‚Äôt make your hair fall out either.
 The Beauty Brains Bottom Line: You can choose whatever you like ‚Äì a retail brand like Pantene, a salon brand like Matrix or a new brand like Phique.
 But shop around and find a product you like and make your own decisions based on your own experience.
 Don‚Äôt pass on Pantene because of stylist anti-hype.
 I think you believe in Pantene Shampoo as well as Conditioner.

 Its everywhere‚Ä¶ buses, billboards, cable.
 Its easy to remember the name.
 My grandma and I have used that for a good 3 years thinking damn the stuff is good.
 Then I was forced into going to my friends hair dresser and bought a shampoo and conditioner from her.
 it was All soft by redken shampoo and the matrix biolage exquisite oil.
 It was like nothing that has ever felt or seen my hair do after just one use.
 I soon bought that for my 87 year old grandma whos hair was beyond damaged.
 I sh*t you not her hair after a week of using it made her look 30 years younger.
 it looked healthier and she had curls again!
 I was astonished what a difference it made.
 MY POINT IS DONT BUY THE CRAP PANTENE MAKES and advertises‚Ä¶.
 just cause they sell so much of it doesn‚Äôt mean its good it means ITS CHEAP in every sense.
 YOU REALLY DO GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller February 4, 2014, 7:55 pm   @Jeffery: Thanks for the story based on your single, personal experience.
 If Pantene is really that bad how do you account for the thousands of data points we‚Äôve seen that show, on a blinded basis, that women prefer Pantene over most drug store and salon brands?
 Believe me, we have no reason to recommend Pantene.
 We‚Äôve never worked for that company and we don‚Äôt make any money from the brand.
 But EVERY time we‚Äôve tested it over the last 15 years or so it has scored extremely well.
 Each test ran between 2 weeks to a month and involved hundreds of women across the US and in some cases the UK, so it‚Äôs not like only a few panelists used the product only once or twice.
 I‚Äôd love to hear how you explain away all that data.
 Reply Link      Rose June 30, 2015, 6:42 pm   Lol data‚Ä¶data collected by self-serving companies out to muse money with their cancer causing and untested ingredients.
 Any ingredient with a number after it or so many letters I can hardly pronounce it is probably man-made and unnecessary.
 Sad world we live in when people care more about how they look than the state of their health -_-   Reply Link      Randy Schueller June 30, 2015, 8:45 pm   @Rose: It‚Äôs that you chose to equate the name of a chemical with its safety.
 That‚Äôs a very naive attitude.
 Also, have you ever looked up these ‚Äúuntested‚Äù ingredients yourself?
 If you‚Äôd bother to, you‚Äôd find there‚Äôs quite a bit of safety data associated with this ‚Äúuntested‚Äù ingredients.
 Let me ask you this: what kind of evidence would it take to change your mind?
 Reply Link      Lauren November 14, 2016, 3:50 pm   Pantene uses so much silicone in their products.
 Silicone is sort of a waxy and plastics product that will just coat your hair making it look shiny and soft without actually keeping in any moisture.
 It‚Äôll act as sort of a barrier to letting any moisture in.
 I suggest using silicone free shampoo.
 Link          Kristen Wilson July 24, 2015, 6:17 pm   I am a Master Cosmetologist and I have a degree in Applied Science as well and Its not about Pantene and Matrix/Redken/BlahBlahBlah ingredients being the same, Its the fact that Pantene uses cheaper, less pure ingredients hence the cheaper price.
 Also, people may love the way their hair feels with Pantene, BUT they are using harsher chemicals to get that nice soft feeling.
 You can have horrible damage happening to your hair but use a chemical that makes it feel soft and shiny.
 If you want the best shampoo/conditioner for your hair at the cheapest price, use Loreal Everpure from any department store or grocery store.
 First of all, Loreal OWNS Redken, Matrix, &amp; most of the other salon brands.
 The fact that this incompetent idiot who replied back to the original question stating that Hair Stylists don‚Äôt know anything about formulations, you clearly don‚Äôt know what all a Cosmetologist has to learn in College.
 I had to take Anatomy &amp; Physiology classes, Chemistry, Electricity, plus MUCH MORE before I even learned how to do any hair.
 Maybe you should know more about stuff before answering questions, instead of giving people inaccurate information.
 Just stating a fact.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller July 25, 2015, 3:07 pm   Hi Kristen.
 Are you referring to the part of our answer where we said ‚ÄúWhile most stylists are very talented at cutting and styling hair, they‚Äôre not very talented at interpreting cosmetic formulations‚Äù?
 We didn‚Äôt mean that to be disrespectful and we fully understand that stylists have some training in cosmetic ingredients.
 However, that training doesn‚Äôt include much background information on the sourcing and chemical composition of the ingredients.
 If it did, you would understand that salon companies buy the same grade of ingredients as mass market companies do.
 If you‚Äôd care to explain EXACTLY which ingredients Pantene uses and how they are cheaper, less pure, and harsher than salon brand ingredients we‚Äôd be glad to continue the discussion.
 Otherwise, we thank you for taking the time to state your personal beliefs but we prefer to share facts with our readers not just unsubstantiated opinions.
 And, FYI, taking classes in Anatomy, Physiology, Chemistry, and Electricity does give you helpful background information but it does not provide the same level of insight and breadth of expertise as actually spending decades formulating hair care products.
 Reply Link      blake March 1, 2017, 12:57 am   Kristin said that she had a degree in applied science, not just a few courses.

 Lol!
 I am a trained cosmetologist.
 But I have worked in the Pharma &amp; Cosmetic Industry for years.
 I will trust the research &amp; Development teams any day üòâ Just saying.
 Link        Heather January 8, 2016, 10:51 pm   All salon products‚Ä¶ Regardless of their extremely long chemical name‚Ä¶work differently for different types of hair (and different people‚Ä¶ with different lifestyles‚Ä¶ in different environments) and most people are honestly clueless as to what combination of chemicals (or salon products) will work best to solve their particular issue.
 Also, many results, positive or negative, are the result of long term use of a product.
 So, most of us NEED someone to ask‚Ä¶ And we need to know that the info.
 we are given is CORRECT!
 My best advice is simply common sense.
 RESEARCH YOUR STYLIST.
 I do not put my faith in most cosmetologists that work for huge chain salons.
 I do, however, completely trust MY stylist‚Ä¶who does not fall into the above catagory.
 Do your homework before trusting your hair to just any cosmetologist.
 It is perfectly OK to phone a higher end salon and request information concerning any past experience, education, and CONTINUED education a cosmetologist may have.
 You will pay more for a great stylist, but it is MORE than worth it.
 You want to find an experienced stylist who not only continues to educate themselves in multiple categories of cosmetology, but also one who is PASSIONATE about their trade.
 I guarantee that once your research is complete, you will find a stylist whom you can trust with all of the important questions.. and one who also excels at their art.
 (I have been known to even search out cosmetologists who continue to teach and travel.
 If there is a demand for them elsewhere, they must know their trade well) However, be prepared to pay for the proffesional treatment.
 And, tip them WELL.
 Once you have found a truly educated- and passionate stylist- that YOU can trust, you want to KEEP THEM.
 You will never have to google a questionable concern again‚Ä¶not when you can get it straight from your PERSONALLY researched cosmetologists.
 I DO NOT know the answers to the hair care questions that matter, but I certainly DO know how to find a trusted proffesional who CAN answer them.
 DON‚ÄôT trust everything you read on line.
 A million STYLISTS have a million opinions, and they are not all as educated in their field as their answers may portray.
 The only way to get really good information is to search out and select your teacher‚Ä¶or cosmetologists- as in this particular instance.
 As a footnote, I would like to say that I ‚Ä¶in NO way‚Ä¶ intended to put down ANY stylists working for a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù salon chain.
 Many of these individuals are EXTREMELY good at what they do, and will most certainly move on to bigger and better things.
 We must all gain experience and start somewhere!
 Those chain stylists that show passion AND a real desire to continue their education in this field are the individuals that I would most certainly grant a chance to.
 However, I would not trust advice from anyone that I had not researched properly.
 But that is ONLY my opinion, and no harm intended.
 Again, different products work differently for different people‚Ä¶ So getting to the ‚Äúroot‚Äù of the problem (a little stylist‚Äôs humor) is of utmost importance before answers and suggestions are given.
 Educate yourself before choosing your ‚Äúteacher‚Äù.
 Your hair is only as good as your stylist!
 Reply Link      Licensed Cosmetologist January 31, 2016, 3:49 pm   Hi.
 As a licensed Cosmetologist with an abundance of experience, talent, body of knowledge and years of continuing education I would like to refute your opinion about ‚Äúchain salons‚Äù.
 My years of experience in the industry have shown me that people who are MORE experienced work either for themselves (in their own sola type salon) or in chain salons because they make far more money in those situations than working for ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù salons.
 Also, in many cases we know that rhe constant exposure to toxic chemicals in full service salons is very detrimental to our health.
 The stylists in chain salons do fewer chemical services and more haircuts, so they use far fewer chemicals in chain salons.
 The cosmos working in ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù salons are generally newly licensed, and trying to gain experience.
 There are usually 1 or 2 experienced cosmos out of the 10-15 who work in these places.
 I‚Äôm glad your experience has been positive.
 But, please know that I see several clients a week coming to me (I work for myself ) to fix the ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù disaster made of their hair.
 Link      Jodi January 22, 2017, 12:56 am   Hi, I know a school York Vo-tech the teacher cut my hair n she did it how she cuts her hair so I am trying not to flip!
 Than I ment someone that chopped my hair an she works at hair cutters salon so I‚Äôm not going to trust them again.
 I put hats on to go out it‚Äôs like she killed my hair she said she thinned it she took the cutter an shaved my hair, not off but took strands an shaved my sides.
 I never had anyone do that to me!
 I am very picky took care of my long hair( love for locks) I have been working on getting my healthy hair back don‚Äôt know why but my hair won‚Äôt grow right it keeps breaking.
 I‚Äôm trying my pantene pRO-V [naturefusion] and I have been mixing it with Garnier Fructis [Fall Fight] I hope it works.
 I have had alot of cosmologists tell me not to use an I did an my hair looked better than their hair, But they always wanted me to use something‚Ä¶ I just want my hair back most of them tell me what helps them‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not them!
 How much it cost to get hair cut sorry but alot of cosmologists in York pa. need more schooling an learn how to cut hair that looks good on the person an have the product sellers come in an sell on certain days to the customers an let the stylist do what they are to do cut it the right way.
 The dealers can come in an let the customers try the product that they want, I hope all a beautiful hair day every day!
 Link      Anjoyla February 3, 2017, 10:22 am   First let me say after reading the responses this is what I think.
 I went to cosmetology school.
 I also went to college .
 I think that cosmetologist are very good at cutting an styling with everything there are some that specialize i.e.
 Color.
 The on going battle about salon products vs drugstore shampoos is old.
 Here is my take.
 There are some salon brands that work nicely an some drugstore brands.
 I myself am allergic to a great deal of products.
 Found this out the hard way all of Redken products break my scalp out.
 Certain drugstore brands an salon brands do to.
 I tried Tresse Me an that made my hair fall out.
 I went to the dermatologist this is what I found out certain sulfates affect the scalp pores.
 I tried Lorel products an scalp broke out.
 Was directed to Baby shampoo.
 But to clear up the breakout you have to use Neutrogena tar shampoo.
 An A anti dandruff.
 I found Clear worked beautifully they just switched to Dove anti dandruff.
 After it is cleared up baby shampoo an Therapee or Pantene then for conditioner Humectress.
 Pantene has never left a film over my hair.
 Early on when it began it was heavily perfumed.
 Now thou I think if you alternate you should have no problem.
 Also you can do a baking soda mixture that takes build off.
 I think you have to try products an find the ones that work for you.
 I don‚Äôt think it is an either or.
 Some people have families an salon products are higher.
 The salon marks these up an the stylist selling this product gets credit for it or a percentage.
 I have used almost everything in the market.
 An I think each of us is unique.
 I don‚Äôt think the scientist is wrong or the cosmitoligust.
 They both are viewing it from different perspectives.
 I think instead of the back an forth working together maybe products could be recommended to help.
 There are a great deal of factors to consider.
 Type of hair, colored, or not dry or oily, allergies, goals of what you are expecting.
 I think all this plays into things.
 I hope this helps you all.

 Maxwell July 27, 2018, 1:41 pm   Yes it is true, we had to learn way more than hair in cosmetology school,and Pantene is NOT good.
 If so, why do no salons carry it, not even smartstyles, or any Regis owned salons !
 @   Reply Link      Perry Romanowski February 26, 2019, 4:08 pm   They don‚Äôt carry it because they can‚Äôt make a profit off of Pantene.
 Simple mathematics.
 Not to worry, salon products are fine too they just aren‚Äôt better.
 Link      Andrea Werdann March 24, 2019, 9:13 pm   Strange, I have tried many different shampoos over the course of time, even giving Pantene a try, against my stylist‚Äôs suggestion, and my scalp got an allergic reaction to something in the formula.
 I get the same reaction from Tresemme products.
 I find it hard to believe that the quality of the formula is safe for hair if my scalp itself is having a bad reaction to it.

 It cleans well, and conditions well !
 Even if it did build up on the hair you are always supposed to clarify in-between anyways, just like if you use too much protein based conditioners, my hair speaks for itself, its long, strong, and shiny!
 Reply Link        Sue March 12, 2016, 7:58 pm   Okay I‚Äôm a hairstylist and I loveeeeee Pantene,I seriously just started using it,And my hair looks and feels amazing.I will not go back to using products in my salon .Despite what my manager says.
 Reply Link      licensedCosmetologistforyears September 15, 2016, 3:17 am   Hey girl, I‚Äôm in TOTAL agreement with you!!
 I‚Äôve been a licensed cosmetologist who works behind the chair for years.
 In my professional experience, I have noticed zero difference in my client‚Äôs hair using salon brands vs. Drug store brands.
 In fact, the drug store and salon brands are many times owned by the same parent company, made is the same materials, in the same factory, using the same formulas.
 Only the package and fragrance are changed.
 So, what does make a difference?
 I find many clients do not choose the correct products for themselves, and they use them incorrectly.
 Once I correct that, they see increased product performance regardless of product line.
 Also, diet, exercise, and other lifestyle factors have a far greater impact than product.
 Smoking, drugs, booze and excessive UV exposure have an immensely negative effect on hair, skin, and nails.
 Far more negative than any product.
 So, let the haters hate.
 They have been brain washes from the time they began cosmetology school with pseudo -science, wives tales, and flat out lies from the vendors.
 The truth is that our industry stays afloat only with product sales.
 Salons that do not retail can not stay open.
 It costs almost as much to perform services as we charge for them.
 The companies are ‚Äúdiverting‚Äù their own products to increase premium sales.
 Products keep our doors open.
 And the salon companies are raising prices on a regular basis.
 It‚Äôs actually kind of a ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù.
 It‚Äôs all about their greed, NOT what‚Äôs best for the clients.
 Use what you like.
 As for pantene?
 I think it‚Äôs just fine.
 There are a lot of drug store brands that work well.
 Don‚Äôt believe me?
 Dig deeper ND start contacting companies like I did.
 You will NEVER pay for salon brands again.

 Not every product is going to work for everyone.
 There are certain shampoos I cant use‚Ä¶   Link        Gina Adams November 5, 2018, 11:51 pm   Same!
 I have been a hairstylist for 10+ years and I was always told not to use Pantene because it‚Äôs garbage and coats the hair.
 BUT I will say I was confused every single time I would ask a client what they use because their hair is REALLY healthy it was always Pantene.
 I mean I really never noticed anyone‚Äôs hair looking as healthy, shiny, thick, and every single time the response was always Pantene.
 I grew up in my moms salon that she worked in and pretty much always used some professional shampoo, biolage, Paul Mitchell, and as a stylist I‚Äôve used so many brands, surface, bumble and bumble, Wella, goldwell, the list goes on and on.
 So, I decided to experiment with otc products.
 And I picked up a bottle of Garnier sleek and shine shampoo and conditioner.
 I was shocked at how well this performed.
 Once that was used up, I tried Pantene.
 My life changed!
 I had never had any product make my hair feel and look so bouncy, soft, smooth, and I literally could not believe it.
 All these years telling clients don‚Äôt use it, because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told, and I felt like wow this must be the best product I‚Äôve ever used.
 I used it for a few months and people started noticing my hair was getting super long and I hadn‚Äôt needed a trim because my ends didn‚Äôt get split or tangly.
 I think that the real reason why hairdressers do not recommend it is because if you use it you won‚Äôt need your hair done as much!!!!!!
 Also they don‚Äôt make any money off recommending products they don‚Äôt carry in the salon.
 Go with your gut and if you like a product don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise!!!

 Link          Danielle Locicero December 5, 2016, 5:29 pm   Hey Randy, You say not to blindly follow stylist recommendation but why should we blindly listen to you.
 You talk about data (hearsay/subjective opinions) of how many people LOVE Pantene.
 Can I see these peer reviewed studies?
 What kind of scientist are you?
 I myself have witnessed physical evidence of build up from drug store shampoos, namely Pantene that seem to leave something on the hair.
 Would gladly change my point of view if you established a case based on science.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller December 6, 2016, 8:18 am   Danielle: You make a good point that we should not take anecdotal stories from people who love Pantene as evidence of anything.
 I also agree that I would love to see peer reviewed studies measuring conditioner buildup of drug store vs salon brands but I‚Äôm not aware of any.
 I don‚Äôt doubt you have witnessed buildup from Pantene since the original intent of the article wasn‚Äôt to say that Pantene leaves NOTHING on hair.
 (After all, ALL conditioners have to leave something behind on the hair or they would have no effect).
 Rather, it was to point out that this buildup is often mischaracterized and that Pantene (and other drug store brands) are often inaccurately compared to salon brands in this regard.
 As a good scientist, I could ask for those who make such claims to provide data to support their assertions.
 Until I see such data I‚Äôm skeptical based on my understanding of those types of formulas.
 Thanks for taking the time to comment!
 Reply Link        Matisen March 29, 2017, 1:52 pm   I just want to know, is it true that pantene is bad for your hair.
 For about almost a month I‚Äôve been using pantene and it smooths and shines my hair for up to 3 or 4 days then I use pantene again.
 So far my hair is smooth but no shine even when I first tried it there was no shine.
 On the 3rd or 4th day my head started to ich then my hair gets greasy then I half to take another shower but I still use pantene.
 My hair growth has been is the middle from short and long hair and the growth of my hair is very slow.
 So far it haven‚Äôt gotten any longer.
 So is pantene really bad for your hair?
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller March 29, 2017, 2:00 pm   As we explained in the post, there is no scientific evidence that we are aware of that indicates Pantene is bad for your hair.
 If you don‚Äôt like the way your hair feels after using it then I suggest you try another product.
 Reply Link      Franky olguin March 12, 2019, 3:19 pm   The same thing happened to me.
 I was using it for 3 weeks and my hair started actually falling out.
 Everytime I go to get a haircut the stylist has to thin it out ALOT but this last time I went she noticed it super thin and greasey and I had little bumps all over my scalp and asked me if I switched and I told her yes to Pantene.
 Well everyone in the salon started going off on how bad it is and grabbed some scissors to scrap off all that waxy build up to show me.
 She also detoxified my scalp with some good shampoo and when she was scrubbing my head I could hear and feel all the bumps pop.
 Well I bought some better shampoo from there that wasn‚Äôt to pricy and my hair grew back!
 My hair wasn‚Äôt greasy anymore and just felt so much healthier.
 More importantly my hair doesn‚Äôt fall out in the shower and is GROWING BACK!
 P.s I looked to see if this was happening to anyone else and I‚Äôm glad I found somewhere that was having the same problems with that shampoo Pantene.
 Reply Link        Rae May 24, 2017, 3:02 am   Maybe because people like myself haven‚Äôt heard anything about the damage Pantene does to your hair.
 05/23/17 was the first I had heard of it being damaging.
 Here I was thinking, I just was getting older.
 I have always had very THICK &amp; COURSE hair, shoulder length.
 Within the last few years that I‚Äôve used Pantene, I noticed my hair thinning.
 It was longer (pass the shoulders) but thinner.
 I gotta get a new shampoo or go back to the days where my grandmother mixed things up in the kitchen (beer, eggs, mayo, onion, etc.)
 Reply Link      Cath July 12, 2017, 3:37 pm   Well I‚Äôve used Pantene conditioner for the last four washes and each time I noticed lots of hair falling out, then I noticed my pony tail was thinner than usual.

 Are you saying that because we believe that Pantene is an effective product that we have ‚Äúlined pockets‚Äù from money that is somehow paid us?
 That‚Äôs simply not true.
 Other than the few dollars we make from Amazon sales commissions we don‚Äôt make anything from this product.
 Also, I‚Äôm not sure how you can claim the product is ‚Äúgarbage.‚Äù Scientific testing (done by other companies than the maker) show that Pantene is one of the best technically performing products on the market.
 Sales data supports that many people like the product as it is a top seller.
 So you may not like the way it feels on your hair but to call it ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù is more than a little biased and presumptuous on your part.

 Thanks for your comment.
 Reply Link          linda June 21, 2014, 8:42 am   I had been a Pantene fan for awhile, but the last few months, my hair has become dry and damaged.
 Yes, I color my hair but I have never had it over processed or damaged from coloring it and no, I do not color it myself!
 Yesterday, I cut 3 inches off of my hair, thinking maybe it had just become too long, but the result was the same, dry and clearly damaged.
 I purchased a deep conditioner by Matrix and what a difference.
 As of today, no more Pantene.

 Reply Link        Leon February 4, 2014, 9:05 pm   I have a scalp condition where it flakes really badly.
 I‚Äôm a 23 year old male and I‚Äôve been using Clear shampoo and Head and Shoulders for god knows how long.
 It works great for 2 hours then the flaking would come back with a vengeance.
 I tried Pantene Pro-V anti dandruff a couple of days ago and I could not believe the results.
 My hair wasn‚Äôt oily, my scalp didn‚Äôt flake, it basically did what other shampoos didn‚Äôt which was restoring my scalp‚Äôs moisture.
 It feels great.
 I‚Äôve used salon brands before and the only one that works better than Pantene would be Redken in my personal opinion.
 I rate Pantene Pro-V anti dandruff a 7.5/10   Reply Link      K September 5, 2015, 10:11 pm   Try Nixon scalp treatment for psoriasis and dandruff.
 There is a three step system.
 Shampoo, conditioner, and something of a serum.
 Works wonders on my head and a lot of my clients.
 It has a cool tingly feeling from the mint   Reply Link        Dara Johnson February 13, 2014, 12:10 pm   I am an African-American woman with relaxed hair.
 In between my visits to my hairdresser who does my relaxer, and any other chemicals and cuts, I would visit Dominican salons (because they are cheap) for wash/set/blow dry.
 Once, I invested in some pretty expensive styling tools (flat iron, blow dryer, etc.)
 and one day when I could get to the salon, I decided to do my own hair.
 I had the Pantene Intense Moisturizing Shampoo for women of color.
 I loved the way my hair came out ‚Äì understand that I used a Frederic Fekkai Shea hydrating conditioner mask, a leave-in conditioner by Motions and used Chi Silk Infusion pre blow-dry.
 Anyway, when I ran out of the Pantene Shampoo, I used another shampoo (Motions) I had in my closet.
 I felt the difference and didn‚Äôt like it.
 I then spent a lot of money for an expensive Frederic Fekkai shampoo.
 It was nice, but I noticed my hair still wasn‚Äôt the way it was when I first starting using Pantene.
 So, I went back to using the Pantene Shampoo just to see if there was going to be any difference.
 Keep in mind, all the other products I mentioned I was using (FF mask, Chi, etc.)
 remained the same; I didn‚Äôt swap those out.
 It was just the shampoo I was experimenting with.
 Needless to say, I couldn‚Äôt believe the difference Pantene did for my hair.
 I‚Äôm amazed at the difference versus an expensive Shampoo such as Frederic Fekkai‚Äôs.
 The ONLY con is that when I would come out the tangles, I still had some sort of residue on my hair, and I‚Äôve always been good at rinsing the conditioner out thoroughly.
 I think I will finish up the FF shampoo which does do a good job of getting rid of build-up on the scalp and hair, for the first rinse, then follow up the last two shampoo‚Äôs with Pantene.
 I‚Äôm a fan for life.

 Reading this article, I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt come away feeling very reassured, tbh you don‚Äôt come off as sounding unbiased or rational, you sound very much like someone who benefits from promoting Pantene and discrediting stylists in quite petty tones.
 Essentially you say that because they aren‚Äôt ~educated enough~ to understand the science of shampoo formulas or the marketing data of P&amp;G, and even more laughable, because salon studios don‚Äôt have the kind of money a multinational corporation has (‚ÄòP&amp;G, makers of Pantene, have a HUGE research budget.
 Certainly larger than any salon company‚Äô) ‚Äì this somehow discredits what these people who work with clients *every day* hearing individual stories from clients *every day* about what Pantene does to their hair.
 You spend the article running stylists down as morons just repeating things they‚Äôve been told to say, while holding up a multinational corporation as trustworthy and obviously having the customers‚Äô best interests at heart rather than *their own*.

 Reply Link      Heather January 8, 2016, 11:17 pm   Dear, Dear Randy.
 You, being an intelligent lad and of sound mind, must be aware that no two individuals are completely the same.
 One product can behave differently when applied to seperate individuals.
 I personally enjoy using Pantene products every once in a while‚Ä¶when in a bind.
 (I am a huge fan of Redken products- perhaps this makes me an enemy?)
 Although it (Pantene) has never effected my hair in a negative manor, I also really can not speak on the subject of long term use.
 Perhaps‚Ä¶for some individuals, this product really did effect them in a negative way.
 Why be so ‚ÄúNippy‚Äù?
 Simply because it has not happened to us (me or you) does not mean it can not happen‚Ä¶ Nor does that make other‚Äôs concerns irrelivent.
 Why not ask more questions BEFORE growing fangs?
 It is only another‚Äôs opinion.
 Nothing is personal.
 You must know this???
 No harm intended!!

 I wont be using any of their products again.
 Reply Link      Anjoyla February 3, 2017, 10:32 am   Helene: I had that problem with Tresse Me smooth.
 Sometimes it is the type of shampoo meaning you get a protein shampoo.
 Too much protein causes the hair to come out or thin.
 Sometimes it is too harsh.
 I think if you look at the products ingredients a great deal of time Shampoo‚Äôs that say smooth have ingredients like almond oil or proteins soy for instance too much can cause that.
 It is like when you over condition your hair it can break or sometimes fall out.
 It is a balance.
 You may need to do a baking soda balance out the ph of the scalp.
 Reply Link        Dana August 15, 2014, 12:40 am   From what i understand is that panthenol penetrates into the cortex of the hair ,and also seals the cuticle and makes your hair shiny .
 what i think can end up happening over time is your hair becomes overfilled with the b-5 and expands which can create frizzy unruly hair .
 its the same thing that happens with some proteins .
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller August 15, 2014, 6:26 am   Panthenol can penetrate and help strengthen from within the cortex.
 I‚Äôve never seen any data to suggest that it smooths the cuticle.
 I‚Äôve also never heard of ‚Äúoverfilling‚Äù with protein causing hair to become frizzier.
 That‚Äôs not how these ingredients work.

 If I wear a collar ‚Äì the hair at my neckline becomes a mass of tangles.
 When I sleep, I wake with a mass of tangles all over!
 I twist my hair up and clip it to the top of my head at night, but it‚Äôs not a perfect fix.

 There‚Äôs not much you can do except keep experimenting with different products that provide hair with a lot of lubricity to help with the tangling.
 Silicones are typically good for this.
 You might also try the Living Proof products which are based on a Teflon like compound that‚Äôs supposed to be pretty good as well.
 Good luck!
 Reply Link      jennifer November 12, 2014, 11:26 pm   I have crazyyyy long, thick, naturally curly hair.
 I would always comb it out b4 i showered (using shampoo and conditioner) yet I would still break/lose tons of hair when i brushed it afterwards.
 I realized that I needed a spray leave in conditioner.
 After trying about 8 different ones i finally found one that worked!
 I was hesitant to buy it bc it was $36 per big bottle‚Ä¶but it was fully worth it.
 ‚ÄúIts a 10‚Äù is hands down the best!
 Reply Link      Mel Noel July 17, 2015, 10:35 pm   Instead of twisting your hair up and into a clip at night, try separating it into two parts with one on each side of your head and braiding them.
 My daughter has the same trouble with her hair.
 She would get crazy rat nest head every night.
 I happened to have to use a new lady at my salon one day and she suggested this.
 It is amazing the difference it has made for her.
 No more painful brush outs in the morning.
 Reply Link      Pye February 27, 2016, 7:50 am   This is ok for some people, but terrible terrible advice for others.
 There are a lot of people who can‚Äôt braid their hair because it will break all up and down the shaft of the hair, leaving you with a raggedy, uneven head of hair.
 I‚Äôve tried everything.
 Loose, loosely scrunchied on top of the head, braided, doesn‚Äôt matter.
 My hair tangles or breaks or (most often) tangles AND breaks.
 Braiding it just makes it worse.
 Reply Link      Arlene November 27, 2017, 1:07 am   Try a silk or satin pillowcase.
 I have extra long, thick, and naturally curly hair.
 I flip my hair up so that the underside is on my pillow when I lay down and I‚Äôm not laying on my hair.
 It helps keep my hair from tangling and getting crazy frizzy while I sleep.
 Also, my curls look good in the morning so I only need a quick touch-up to smooth any stray hairs or tame a tiny bit of frizz here and there.
 They‚Äôre good for your skin, too.
 You won‚Äôt get pillow lines on your face.
 Reply Link        Happy July 26, 2015, 11:05 am   I have this problem to an extent, especially at night.

 You will be amazed I promise.
 Reply Link      Pye February 27, 2016, 7:46 am   Yeah, I guarantee you, if you start brushing your hair 100 strokes every night, you will be amazed at the results!
 Sure, if by ‚Äúamazed‚Äù you mean ‚Äúappalled‚Äù.
 This is the single most damaging thing that was ever done to my hair.
 Add up all the bad perms I ever had, and they are nothing compared to 15 years of brushing my hair 100 strokes.
 Why would ANYONE think rubbing and abrading your hair over and over and over again is ‚Äúgood‚Äù for it?
 Get a hair pick.
 Throw the brushes away.

 As if that is not bad enough, mid day it looks as if I have not washed my hair in weeks do to the wax build up on my hair.
 If you was your hair with Pantene shampoo and conditioner while in the bath tub, I encourage you to look at the wax that is floating on the top of the water after the suds settle.
 Needless to say, I will not be continuing the use of Pantene!

 Then I heard it was bad and started using expensive sulphate free salon products.
 I have spent SO much.
 Nothing feels as good as Pantene.
 My hair got worse and worse with these other products.
 You always hear Pantene is bad because there are thick waxes that make your hair look nice, yet build up.
 Well the nicer my hair looks the less I‚Äôm going to heat style it into looking nice.
 So that is a benefit with Pantene.
 I fuss with my hair much, much less.
 Reply Link      Samantha December 2, 2018, 12:20 am   That‚Äôs exactly the same as me!
 I‚Äôve used the expensive products and it just doesn‚Äôt compare to Pantene.
 I used to have to blow dry and straighten my hair since I live in humid Florida lol!
 Now that I use Pantene, I can just blow dry it without having to damage my hair with addition heat from the flat iron.
 A lot of people are saying they noticed their hair falling out but mine has been the complete opposite.
 Now when I shower I don‚Äôt notice any hair coming out.
 If for some reason in the upcoming months I notice a wax buildup I‚Äôll just use a clarifying shampoo once in awhile.
 Reply Link        Sabrina January 12, 2015, 12:00 pm   I went to get my hair cut this past weekend.
 I have this one section in the back of my hair that I have been trying to grow out for over a year and its still not that long, the stylist said it could be a dry patch.
 I told her I was taking Biotin and using Argan oil and then she asked me what shampoo am I using and I told her Pantene she said ‚ÄúOh let me tell you a little secret about Pantene‚Äù that she learned in the hair cutting school and about the wax it leaves on your hair.
 She even took a small section of my hair, took her scissors and scrapped down to the ends and showed me this white stuff on my hair and said it was the wax from Pantene shampoo.
 At first I was like ewww and was very convinced that I needed to change shampoo and conditioner immediately.
 Well I am glad I didn‚Äôt and found this article, it sure pays to research things out.
 I really do like the girl who cuts my hair she does a great job, its sad the school she went to is telling them what is good and what is not in the Shampoo/Conditioner world.

 It was past my bra line very full ect the women at the salon left bleach on my hair for 4 n a half hrs despite my concerns her AND the owner kept reassuring me that it was fine .. i had a volleyball game to do to and didnt have time for a style so she did a treatment on my hair free of charge and gave me a bottle of very expensive shampoo n conditioner ‚Äù bc she had just bleached my hair‚Äù she charged me 200 dollars n i left .. she locked up n left which i thought was strange bc she said she had a client after me but i went on my way i look in the mirror when i got in my truck n seen chunks of short hair everywhere so i run my fingers through my hair and HANDFULLS WERE COMING out.
 .. anyways after cutting into an inverted bob ive tried everything ive been using clear which i LOVE for ever but today i was running late n showered at my mom‚Äôs n used her Pantene despite all of the horror stories and my hair feel GREAT better than EVER shiney , healthy looking , N softer then ever!!

 Reply Link        Di March 25, 2015, 1:59 am   For you to say that cosmetologist a are inexperienced with formulas is not just incorrect, it is flat out defamation.
 Pantene has a huge budget for a reason!
 To mask how awful their product is.
 I‚Äôll save you the tales of clients who have LOST hair due to Pantene products and just tell you that a former client worked for them.
 In advertising.
 He said that they knew their product was awful.
 Trying to pass off press promotion as truth is despicable.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller March 25, 2015, 7:43 am   Di: Let me ask you this: then how do you account for the fact that when we test Pantene on a blinded basis (in other words, people don‚Äôt know what the product is) most people still preferred Pantene to other products (including salon products?)
 Reply Link      Pye February 27, 2016, 8:00 am   Seriously?
 You have to even ask that?
 I‚Äôve been using Pantene for over 30 years.
 And over the years, my hair has become increasingly brittle, falls out, its thinning, it is half the length it used to be.
 And when did this start?
 About 30 years ago.
 Yeah, that‚Äôs right ‚Äì just after I switched to Pantene.
 I‚Äôve been a Pantene booster for decades.
 I have to agree with others, it is pretty clear you are far from objective.
 I don‚Äôt know why you are so invested in a particular brand of shampoo, but the fact is that over the years Pantene has just exploded like a cancer.
 I can‚Äôt even count how many ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù products there are now.
 Every time I need a new bottle of shampoo, all the labels have changed.
 I rather doubt the actual INGREDIENTS have changed nearly so much as the label and the names.
 I give up.
 I‚Äôve stuck with Pantene through thin and thinner.
 Its time to move on.
 The blatant boosterism on this site has really opened my eyes ‚Äì to the fact that these days, Pantene is all sizzle and no meat.
 Oh, and the answer to your question, ‚Äúwhy do people prefer it in blind tests‚Äù ‚Äì that is easy.
 Because it has some immediate short-term benefits which add up over time to damage instead of help.
 That would most likely be mostly due to dimethicone and its kin, which coats the hair strands and make it look shinier and feel smoother.

 Reply Link      licensed Cosmetologist April 18, 2015, 1:53 am   As a licensed cosmetologist, who has a passion for the science of chemistry and product formulation, I must agree that Pantene is a good product.
 I work behind the chair 5 days a week, and see anywhere from 50 to 80 heads of hair a week.
 Hair, skin, and nail health is so often a reflection of one‚Äôs internal health rather then of the product they use.
 Also, remember that the wrong formula for you will never yield good results.
 The reason many people get ‚Äúbetter‚Äù results from pro products isn‚Äôt due to a better formula.
 ..it‚Äôs my experience in knowing the type of formula you need.
 I am also trained in how to properly use each item.
 So often my clients are using the wrong products, and using them incorrectly.
 that alone will make or break your hair /skin/nails.
 So many ‚Äúprofessional brands ‚Äù are owned by the same parent companies which own the grocery store brands.
 They are made of the same ingredients, in the same factories at the same time.
 The difference?
 Many times it‚Äôs only the packaging and fragrance.
 For instance Purology is owned by loreal.
 The loreal everpure line is almost identical to purology.
 Read the label.
 Also, knowing that many ingredients have multiple names for the same exact thing helps.
 So, when you are doing a side by side comparison of ingredients‚Ä¶.be sure the name which is ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù is truly a different chemical.
 It very well may be the same chem, with a different designation.
 Or one which is chemically going to function the same in the formula , but may have been changed due to viscosity, fragrance, availability at time of production, color, etc.
 the professional products industry is really just a way the salon industry has tried to infuse money into the dying salon services industry.
 Don‚Äôt buy the hype!
 Reply Link      Sydney Howard April 26, 2015, 10:39 am   I‚Äôm sure there are many who have wonderful experiences with both drugstore and salon haircare.
 However, I think that to say that drugstore is just as good as salon would be false.
 There is a reason that professional hair products cost more.
 The ingredients are better.
 As someone who has used almost every brand out there, I get much better results with professional lines.
 Pantene, Garnier, and Tresseme all caused buildup in my hair.
 If you want to use pantene, I recommend using a clarifying shampoo at least once or twice a month.
 John Frieda and Clear were much better products for my hair, so I‚Äôd recommend those lines if you want to go the drugstore route.
 I think there are many pros for using professional shampoo.
 A lot of drugstore brands list water as one of their ingredients.
 The more water, the more diluted the product, and the more product you will need to use to achieve the desired result.
 This means you will end up purchasing more product.
 Depending on how quickly you go through a product, you will be spending as much as you would on a more concentrated, professional product.
 Do the math.
 Let‚Äôs say a bottle of pantene costs $5.99.
 If you go through a small bottle once two months, you‚Äôre spending at least $36 for shampoo during the year.
 It takes me six months to get through a $17 bottle of Matrix.
 That‚Äôs $34/year.
 It could potentially be cheaper to use a professional line.
 Professional products typically have better ingredients.
 I‚Äôm not saying this is always true, but a lot of the time, price point is very reflective of the quality.
 That isn‚Äôt to say that some professional products aren‚Äôt crap.
 It‚Äôs just like makeup.
 I wouldn‚Äôt recommend clinique to anyone over the age of 19.
 The same goes with some salon lines.
 Aveda, for example, has many products that aren‚Äôt very effective in my experience.
 But there are many professional products I would swear by.
 I‚Äôve used Matrix Biolage Volumebloom with great success.
 It smells wonderful and doesn‚Äôt leave residue, and you can often get it for a great price (Check Ulta or your local hair salon for deals).
 But my favorite lines are R+Co and Oribe.
 R+Co is a relatively new line started by Howard McLaren (previous creative director of Bumble &amp; Bumble and Toni &amp; Guy), Garen, and Thom Priano.
 The products are vegan and sulfate free, and the fragrances come from the same company in France (I believe) that make the fragrances for Tom Ford.
 Those fragrances retail for around $75-200.
 You won‚Äôt find fragrance like that in any drug store brand hair product.
 Ever.
 R+Co is not the most expensive professional line.
 Shampoos are about $24 and styling products range from $20-30.
 This is a lot cheaper than brands like Kerastase or Shu Uemura.
 Oribe is another great line.
 It‚Äôs pricey.
 I won‚Äôt argue with you.
 But for someone who has colored hair (blue ombre that is difficult to maintain), I swear by their colored hair line.
 I use a tiny dime sized amount of shampoo and conditioner, so the $39 bottle of shampoo and conditioner lasts me for a long time.
 It would last about 6 months with everyday use, but I alternate with other products such as Wella, R+Co, Matrix, and Paul Mitchell so I only need to purchase it about one a year or so.
 The shampoo has ingredients that help preserve my color and protect my hair from harmful UV rays that cause fading.
 It also smells incredible, and leaves my hair soft and silky without weighing it down from residue.
 I‚Äôve never used a bad product from Oribe.
 I‚Äôm a huge fan of their Dry Texture Spray.
 It‚Äôs expensive, but it‚Äôs the best dry shampoo and texture spray I‚Äôve ever used.
 It absorbs oils, allows me to add exactly how much texture I want to my blowout, and smells incredble.
 Every stylist I‚Äôve ever been to also swears by this product.
 In any case, there‚Äôs a haircare regime for every lifestyle and budget.
 I probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend Pantene to anyone, and I do think that professional products typically work better.
 They often contain better ingredients and are more concentrated.
 However, there are plenty of drugstore products that work well and cost less.

 Thank for taking the time to comment!
 We totally agree that some people love their salon brands more than drug store brands but the idea that salon products all use better ingredients and are more concentrated is is just a myth.
 How do we know?
 Because we‚Äôve worked on these products and tested many, many different formulas both salon and drugstore.
 Let‚Äôs just say there are good and bad products in each.

 The people who are using these professional products and saying they dont work are probably using them like they use Pantene, because pantene isnt as thick and concentrated as products like All Soft by Redkin for example, pantene runs out of the nozzle quick and clients will tend to fill their whole palm with shampoo and conditioner.
 If youre using just a DIME size of shampoo ONLY on your scalp and then using a DIME size of conditioner ONLY on your ends you will save a ton of money.
 Many people dont even know how to use shampoo and conditioner correctly, no one EVER told them the right way.
 Many people use conditioner on their scalp which you are NOT supposed to do.
 Your scalp produces the oils your roots need to be nourished.. Its your ends that are damaged, which is why you never want to shampoo your ends, youll be stripping what little oils your ends were holding onto.
 NEVER SHAMPOO YOUR ENDS AND NEVER CONDITION YOUR SCALP!!
 So even if you are using the pantene line, try that method of shampooing and see if it helps your frizzyness and product build up.
 Either way it will help you use less and spend less.
 Reply Link      Canitra Baskin July 23, 2015, 12:30 pm   I have been using Pantene for three to four months now.
 It leaves my scalp feeling great and my hair looking wonderful.
 My daughter on the other hand says that it dries her hair out.
 I believe it has to do with the texture of ones hair and the different types of Pantene.
 You have to select the Pantene type that is for your hair.
 One thing I have observed in selecting the type for your hair is that it leaves your hair healthy.
 I like it and for now it is my shampoo/conditioner of choice.
 Reply Link      laur July 27, 2015, 10:38 pm   I‚Äôve been using Pantene for years and when my friends do things with my hair they always ask if I use special product in my hair to make it soft, so I tell them it‚Äôs just my basic shampoo and conditioner.
 I started using a little in the top of my head so that it doesn‚Äôt frizz as much and I feel as if it clogs the pores on my scalp.

 i had my first bow out 5 months ago and when i looked in the mirror closely to EACH strain of hair i had SO many split ends.
 I had about every split end listed to be exact.
 So i did a bit of research and it could be the heat i use on my hair OR it can be that the pantene shampoo and conditioner is too strong for my hair and causing crazy split ends.
 Please reply quick i‚Äôm scared that my hair might damage all the way and i might loose it all.
 Reply Link      Tyler August 17, 2015, 9:34 pm   I would just like to say if pantene is sooo amazing and works so well them why isn‚Äôt it sold in a salon when the company could make way more money if they sold it in a salon.
 I‚Äôm a hairdresser and every time someone uses pantene I can feel a build up on there hair and there hair is in terrible shape.
 But everyone is different so if you like pantene then fine.
 But ask yourself if this product line is suppose to be so good why isn‚Äôt it in a salon???
 Reply Link      Pye February 27, 2016, 8:17 am   Wow.
 Because they make craploads more money selling it to MILLIONS of people as opposed to maybe a tenth of that market if sold through ‚Äúsalons‚Äù.
 You‚Äôre a ‚Äúhairdresser‚Äù.
 Good for you.
 That means exactly nothing.
 Some of the worst advice I have ever had for my hair ‚Äì no, ALL of the worsts advice ‚Äì came from ‚Äúhairdressers‚Äù and people with degrees in ‚Äúcosmetology‚Äù.
 Recently I read a posting somewhere from a cosmetologist who was boasting about the classes she took in ‚Äúcollege‚Äù.
 That‚Äôs right.
 She claimed she had taken a class in ‚ÄúElectricity‚Äù.
 I bet that was right after her class in ‚ÄúFire‚Äù.
 Remember, when you shell out the big bucks for overhyped salon formalas to pour on your head and then wash down the drain, all you‚Äôve done is finance some executive‚Äôs trip to Bimini with his mistress.
 No shampoo works for EVERYBODY.
 I‚Äôm pretty sure Pantene isn‚Äôt working for me now, and I begin to doubt that it ever did.
 Reply Link        Krista August 24, 2015, 12:45 pm   The ingredient dimethicone is reason alone to avoid it.
 That‚Äôs what creates the fake coating on the hair.
 It‚Äôs a silicone that coats the hair which causes hair to feel smoother at first but over time it actually damages hair.
 The coating it leaves on hair makes a barrier which blocks natur moisture from getting into hair causing hair to dry out which leads to breakage.
 Dimethicone also is not water soluable so it‚Äôs difficult to rinse out which leads to build up.
 Pantene is also full of sulfate which is harsh and drying on hair.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller August 24, 2015, 2:33 pm   Krista: Dimethicone does coat the hair and make it feel softer.
 I‚Äôm not aware of any evidence that it causes damage to hair or that it blocks ‚Äúnatural moisture.‚Äù Do you have anything to back up your statement or is this just your personal belief?
 Reply Link      Krista August 24, 2015, 4:23 pm   I‚Äôm a cosmetologist and have taken many beauty classes.
 The problem with dimethicone is it‚Äôs water insoluble so it‚Äôs very difficult to wash out.
 It takes heavy sulfates to get dimethicone out of hair and heavy sulfates strip hair of natural moisture.
 If the product builds up in hair the buildup also traps pollutants from the environment into the hair.
 Dimethicone is just not a necessary ingredient.
 It‚Äôs added a lot of times to make the product application smoother.
 Not all silicones are bad.
 Water soluble silicones are best.
 Silicones don‚Äôt really nursing hair from the inside though.
 They just coat the outside of hair to make it appear smoother and healthier.
 It‚Äôs better to use a pure light weight oil such as argan oil to nourish hair and help with dry ends.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller August 24, 2015, 4:25 pm   Thanks for sharing your opinion.
 Reply Link            Krista August 24, 2015, 8:29 pm   My opinion is that a more natural ingredient list is best.
 There are plenty of salon professional brands that I also wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
 Rather then focusing on brand name it‚Äôs better to focus on the ingredient label.
 What I like to look for on the bottle is that it says: Color safe sulfate free paraben free phthalate free Petroleum free PEG free Synthetic fragrance free Silicone free Organic is nice as well.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller August 24, 2015, 8:56 pm   You‚Äôre certainly entitled to believe what ever you want.

 An easy way to solve the problem of wondering if your hairdresser is b.s.ing look at the ingredients on the bottle, put them all on a Google search so that you fully understand what they are and they big names such as polysiloxanes (silicone, a commonly used ingredient that‚Äôs terrible for your hair) don‚Äôt slip by un noticed.

 You know what *I* don‚Äôt want to pay for?
 Whatever damage someone like you has done to my hair.
 I stopped going to salons decades ago.
 It seemed to take forever for all that damaged hair to grow out.
 You don‚Äôt ‚Äúlearn how certain chemicals and ingredients will react in your hair‚Äù.
 You learn to parrot a few memorized sound memes that perpetuate myths about hair care.
 As for checking ingredients, I ALWAYS do.
 And hair care products on both sides of the shopping aisles use the same ingredients over and over again.
 You can find MANY products that are virtually identical.
 And half the time, even if they look like there are differences, it will turn out that they are just using different names for the same or functionally identical substances.
 You say: ‚ÄúIs the person you are listening to an educated licensed cosmetologist or educated chemist or is it a well spoken marketer?‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry, but there is no comparison to a chemist when we‚Äôre talking about so-called cosmetologists.
 Which leaves the ‚Äúeducated‚Äù licensed cosmetologist being equated to a marketer.
 Now THAT one I can get behind!
 Reply Link        Kayla September 5, 2015, 10:19 pm   I won‚Äôt knock panteen but just be aware of the ingredients that you are putting into your hair and the effects they have over time.
 Some professional products work better than others but none will work if you don‚Äôt allow them enough time and use them properly.
 Often people cut out needed steps in order to budget their products.
 If you‚Äôre using styling tools good shampoo and conditioner really isn‚Äôt enough.
 Also be careful who you are taking advice from.
 Is the person you are listening to an educated licensed cosmetologist or educated chemist or is it a well spoken marketer?
 Reply Link      Sharon October 7, 2015, 3:57 pm   This is long, and I‚Äôm sure no one will read it, but‚Ä¶ Let me start off by saying that I have problem hair.
 Very long, very thick, often dry and frizzy, especially at the ends.
 It‚Äôs also a mixture of curly and wavy, and my split ends are usually a mess a week after I cut my hair, easily.
 I also lose a ton of hair every time I wash or brush it ‚Äì but you‚Äôd never be able to tell, because there‚Äôs still so much left, always!
 (photo for reference: http://imgur.com/mYTs6iC ) So now that that‚Äôs out of the way‚Ä¶ Because no one else I know has such unruly or thick hair‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve learned to cut it myself, because of the terrible experience I always have at hair stylists.
 I tried expensive ones ‚Äì I‚Äôd always leave feeling worse about my hair, and bad about myself in general, after they assumed I never brush or wash it (even though I‚Äôd come in with it wet and having just been washed and combed).
 They‚Äôd try so hard to sell me their expensive shampoos, which I fell for, a few times.
 I didn‚Äôt notice anything special bout them.
 Then I went back to cost-effective stylists.
 I got the same pitch about how terrible Pantene was, on the occasions I admitted to using it.
 I‚Äôd usually flip-flop between some combination of Herbal Essences, Pantene and Garnier.
 My preference was actually pre-reformulated Herbal Essences.
 But anyway, I‚Äôm back to Pantene now.
 Again, I‚Äôve gone my whole life never having met another person with my hair type.
 My hair is so strange, that it confounds stylists who see hundreds of people every day, and everyone I meet who has hair tips for me ‚Äì well, first, they never work, and second, it comes from the same perspective stylists have ‚Äì that I must pay no attention to my hair for it to be so unruly.
 For my hair type?
 Pantene has produced the best results for me.
 Are they fantastic results?
 Not necessarily, but it depends.
 My hair is still giant, crazy and unruly, but the truth is ‚Äì so far, dozens and dozens of products later (shampoo, conditioner, treatments, oils, anti-frizz serums, leave-in conditioners, dry shampoos, etc) I never see any real change, other than my hair getting oily, rather than conditioned, from these products, or giving it an even weirder shape than it began with.
 I will say though, that a fresh wash with Pantene, a blowdry, and ironing out a few kinks the blowdryer couldn‚Äôt catch ‚Äì I truly have that ‚ÄúPantene‚Äù hair you see in the commercials ‚Äì shiny, unbelievably soft, full and impressive.
 (It just doesn‚Äôt last long, so I don‚Äôt do it often, as any bit of moisture in the air, it coverts into conjointed curls and waves, with frizz for days).
 So, I keep it simple, now.
 I use giant Pantene bottles from Costco.
 Is it the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to my hair?
 I mean, maybe.
 My whole experience with having hair in general has been lackluster, haha.
 Does Pantene make my hair fall out?
 Probably not.
 My hair just‚Ä¶ falls out.
 We‚Äôre mammals after all.
 I lose more hair in the summer, just like my cats do!
 Lastly‚Ä¶ Shampoo is not the only thing that affects the quality of your hair.
 I‚Äôm certain that my hair is of such strange/poor/dry quality because of my diet being poor for so long.
 And, my friends who had thick and luxurious hair, not have thinning, brittle hair after having had kids.
 So, I just wanted to throw that out there.
 Shampoo is by no means the only culprit for your hair woes.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller October 7, 2015, 4:30 pm   Hi Sharon.
 I read your comment!
 And thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts.
 Given the situation with your hair, if Pantene was as bad as so many people seem to think, then I‚Äôd expect it to make your strands fall out in clumps!
 Why doesn‚Äôt it?
 Because, as you noted, the situation is more complicated than just what shampoo/conditioner you use.
 Thanks for being a fan of the Beauty Brains!
 Reply Link      Sharon October 9, 2015, 7:32 pm   Yeah, I can understand not liking a product or being unhappy with it, but Pantene would not have been around for the entirety of my life if it made everyone‚Äôs hair fall out.
 There would‚Äôve been an investigation in the company, and they would‚Äôve been bankrupt long ago.
 The vitriol on this forum is astounding to me!
 I‚Äôve never hated a product so much as some of the commenters here.
 I agree that most companies are out to make money, but that doesn‚Äôt make them inherently bad.
 They‚Äôre providing a service to someone, and getting money in exchange.
 The same thing everyone does at their jobs in order to get a paycheck.
 Again, may not be the best shampoo out there, but not everyone can spend gobs of money on the salon quality shampoos ‚Äì And even so, much like myself, maybe you have a poor diet that‚Äôs causing your hair to be brittle, or maybe some other health issue.
 Maybe you‚Äôre a mother who didn‚Äôt take prenatals?
 Also, hair changes all the time.
 Age can also make hair fall out.
 Etc, etc.
 Oh, and lastly, in regards to your comments in the article about hair dressers ‚Äì I think everyone is also taking that out of context.
 Hair dressers know about the chemicals and what to use to create certain results, but they‚Äôre not the ones taking the base chemicals, getting FDA approval, and testing them before placing them on the market.
 (That‚Äôs how I took it anyway.)
 Reply Link          Jenny October 20, 2015, 11:11 pm   I used Pantene shampoo and conditioner for the very first time and I must say my hair feels really soft and silky after shower.

 Reply Link      Kat November 25, 2015, 5:26 am   I know you‚Äôre not supposed to feed the trolls but‚Ä¶  Anecdata does not equate to real data.
 Training and education are different.
 The amount of training for hairdressing and cosmetology is significantly less than for a research chemist.
 Each person has individual needs.
 Just as some people have iron deficiencies so will some people have excess iron, and each would have different nutritional needs because of that.
 Everything is made of chemicals or elements and some sound scary if you don‚Äôt know what they do and are too belligerently ignorant to learn.
 Salon brands cater to a specific market that differs from the market that shops in supermarkets; they‚Äôre shifting the supply/demand curve if you‚Äôve taken any economics.
 All humans have bias and we can manage if not eliminate it.
 Statements like ‚Äúoh my god that thing is the worst for literally everyone because my experiences represent every human being on the planet especially since I took a class about this‚Äù are very strongly biased whereas statements like ‚Äúthe research and evidence I have seen support this and I would love to see the evidence you have available that is contradictory‚Äù do a much better job of managing bias.
 Naturalistic fallacies and ad hominem attacks (or shill attacks) are logically useless and often used by those with self protecting or serving agendas such as anti-vax proponents (some who directly profit but most who endanger public health).
 Arguments like ‚Äúif it‚Äôs so great then why isn‚Äôt it sold in salons‚Äù fail to account for the economics that have made televisions and anti-inflammatories available at reasonable prices over the counter.
 Evaluating arguments and biases is a very good practice, but humans are often bad at critically examining their own biases and fallacies.
 Phew.
 I used Pantene for frizz and it was bad at leaving my oily scalp clean.
 Another product line of theirs might be more appropriate especially since I‚Äôve adjusted to only shampooing every week.
 I have used many brands including lush but have noticed fairly similar performance.
 I lose a lot of hair in the shower, but I used to lose it around the house when I shampooed every day.
 Since all hair follicles go through growth and shedding phases (from my forensics class, though I‚Äôm sure a forensic scientist would remember the technical terms and subtleties better), I‚Äôm not all that concerned since that can be determined by genetics.
 As someone with finer but curly hair, I already know mine are probably strange.
 My ends have definitely been in better shape since I started conditioning closer to daily and applying henna monthly.
 I would love to see you cover henna as a dye product because of its different mechanism than conventional dye and occasionally my research has seen conflicting information.
 Also if you‚Äôve already done a bit on cuticles, I‚Äôd love to see it.
 My understanding is that there are mechanical and chemical ways to lift or smooth the hair cuticle, and that acids will smooth and bases will lift it but products also can tamp it down to reduce friction and tangling.
 Keep at it!

 Again I do love my Pantene!
 Reply Link      Cathy March 12, 2016, 12:41 am   I think it depends on what type of hair you have.
 I‚Äôm Asian and have black/dark-brown hair that is very thick and unfortunately gets oily very easily.
 I don‚Äôt need a shampoo that will make my hair even shinier.
 When I use Pantene ‚Äì it does just that.
 My hair gets greasy and oily very quickly after shampooing and/or conditioning with Pantene, whereas I don‚Äôt have that problem with other shampoos.
 Maybe for dry hair, Pantene is good.
 But for oily hair‚Ä¶ it makes the problem much worse.
 Also ‚Äì please don‚Äôt believe that just because a corporation is big that it makes products that are good for you.
 They just care about making products people will buy.
 ie: Coca-Cola is a huge corporation.
 The stuff tastes delicious.
 Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good for you‚Ä¶   Reply Link      Cindy March 12, 2016, 6:50 pm   Hi!
 I used to use every other shampoo, lets just say, my hair was frizzy,ugly,old,and split.
 I switched to pantene, and every single time after i use it, my friends ask me what kind of shampoo i use.
 It‚Äôs smells so good, and PLUS my hair is in good condition now!
 Don‚Äôt listen to the rumors.
 Reply Link      Barb March 27, 2016, 7:25 am   People don‚Äôt realize that Pantene started as a salon product.
 I started using it about 30 years ago and first bought it from a salon.
 I was so happy when it started to be sold in stores.
 If it was so bad the product wouldn‚Äôt still be selling.
 I‚Äôve used it all these years with a few forays out to other salon products, I‚Äôve used Wen, Redkin, Paul Mitchel, etc., and I come back to Pantene.
 The reason salons try to push their product is that they make a large percentage on those sales.
 Reply Link      Jane October 5, 2017, 8:14 pm   @Barb ‚Äì I do remember when Pantene was a salon product.
 It began showing up on drugstore shelves in the 80‚Äôs as a very expensive salon brand in distinctive highend bottles (think at about $10/bottle which was an un-heard of high end price for a drugstore offering in those days).
 I bought it and was blown away.
 It was amazing product that totally transformed my hair.
 It was super rich and concentrated and you only used a dab.
 I had never experienced such a unique product and the results were insane.
 I would only use it for going out because it was so ‚Äòspecial‚Äô I didn‚Äôt want to use it all up, but it would completely transform my hair with huge body and shine.
 It was like a whole different head of hair!
 Then after a few years of buying my special Pantene treat every year and raving about it to friends, they disappeared from the shelves in the little specialty hair section and I saw them become this massive presence on the mass produced product shelves.
 I tried some of the ‚Äònew‚Äô Pantene and it just wasn‚Äôt the same.
 I guess they got bought out and reformulated and the mass marketing began and they ended up as being the biggest selling drug store product we see today.
 But I used the original pantene products and they were truly AMAZING.
 What they ended up as now is a basic fairly decent product for the masses, and the most amazing thing about them are the ads.
 I have mini travel size bottles of Pantene that I sometimes use to change things up (Smooth and Sleek), or toss in a bag for an overnight, but have never had good results in using any of the ‚Äònew‚Äô Pantene products on a daily basis.
 My go to products are Matrix Biolage Color System and Kevin Murphy Moisture Wash and Angel Rinse primarily as my shampoo and conditioning and these have never disappointed.
 Reply Link        Tamara letson March 28, 2016, 5:51 pm   I went from using a regular cheaper shampoo and conditioner to using Pantene and after only a few months my hair was falling out by the handful.
 I lost more then half my hair before I switch back to a less expensive brand and its been about 3 months and finally my hair has slowed down and is getting fuller again.
 Also before all that I got my hair colored as a gift for my Birthday and as soon as the product was on my hair for about 2 min my head felt like my head was on fire  Thank goodness it wasn‚Äôt on for long and didn‚Äôt do to much damage.
 It it has taken a few treatment‚Äôs to get it back to as healthy as it was prior to using Pantene.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller March 28, 2016, 5:53 pm   Did you get your hair colored before you started using Pantene?
 If so, that could have been the cause of your hair loss.
 Reply Link        Serena March 31, 2016, 8:33 am   I am baffled by the ignorance of this article.
 Just because you compare to other salon products that have these toxic chemicals does NOT make it ok!
 No offense but you do not know what you are talking about.
 No plastics found in Pantene?
 Silicone is almost like a plastic creating shine but depleting the hair of moisture.
 Quaternium18 releases formaldehyde!
 There are no regulations in the beauty industry.
 Just because it‚Äôs on the shelf does not make it safe.

 Reply Link        Jami April 9, 2016, 9:16 am   I combined coupons with a sale on Pantene and bought a bunch of bottles to last my family a long while.
 About nine months ago I started getting itchy patches on my scalp that would scab up.
 Six months ago I noticed that my brush was very full of hair after brushing.
 After my husband commented on how thin my hair looked I started taking vitamins, thinking that was the cause of my hair issues.
 No change.
 I finally thought I‚Äôd try switching shampoos.
 That was a few months ago and my itchy scalp is gone and the hair loss stopped almost immediately after switching shampoos.
 I‚Äôve shared my story with friends and family who shared they‚Äôd had the same experience.
 I‚Äôll never use it again.
 Reply Link      Rebeccah April 16, 2016, 12:46 am   Count me another satisfied user of Pantene conditioner, since the 1980s.
 I‚Äôm still looking for my perfect shampoo.
 I only wash my hair a couple of times a week and prefer a clarifying shampoo applied mostly to the scalp, followed by whatever scalp treatment I am using, followed by whatever the current ‚Äúsleek‚Äù Pantene conditioner formulation is, applied mostly to the roots.
 I *like* having dimethicone in the conditioner ‚Äì I determined a long time ago, when I was comparing conditioners, that that was what made the difference between the ones I liked and the ones I didn‚Äôt.
 The ones that ‚Äúhydrate‚Äù or ‚Äúadd body‚Äù just leave my hair feeling dirty and gunky.
 The silicones leave my hair slippery and shiny and easy to comb.
 I don‚Äôt have any trouble washing them out the next time I shampoo.
 Reply Link      Louise April 30, 2016, 6:34 am   I seem to always go back to using Pantene, even after using a salon products.
 I spent a year going organic using Arbonne shampoo and conditioner but my hair didn‚Äôt benefit from it after 3month, but I continued using until it was finished.
 The more I looked at organic products I became to realize just because it comes from the earth, not man made it doesn‚Äôt mean it is good for you.
 Reply Link      ALAINA USSIN May 6, 2016, 5:58 pm   Well, I am a stylist and I believe in people having healthy hair not just to sale products.
 But 9 out of 10 of my clients with wavy or curly hair that used Pantene at home, hair has broken off in several places or is very dry.
 I never used Pantene but most of the time when I noticed the problems in my clients hair and ask them what they are using, it‚Äôs often Pantene.
 I had a young Indian girl come in the beginning of the summer with a head full of hair, just beautiful.
 Her hair was gorgeous so I didn‚Äôt ask what she was using because whatever it was it was working.
 But, by the end of the summer, she came back for another trim and her hair was falling out by the hand full.
 I asked her what she was using and it was Pantene.
 She is just one out of many that I have noticed this problem.
 I do notice that it is fine for people with naturally straight hair.
 I would never recommend this product to anyone.
 If it works for you great.
 Not a fan and will never be.
 I don‚Äôt have to be a scientist to see the damage it does to people‚Äôs hair.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller May 7, 2016, 9:05 am   Just remember ‚Äì Pantene is one of the top selling products so of course when you ask people what they‚Äôre using many will say Pantene.
 That doesn‚Äôt establish a cause and effect relationship.
 Reply Link        Ari May 25, 2016, 12:23 am   My usual shampoo is Suave because it doesn‚Äôt leave any greasy residue in my hair, but lately, I‚Äôve grown tired of it.
 So, i switched to Pantene color revival.
 At first, I thought it was helping my hair to retain some moisture and repair it, but after a week, my hair felt so greasy and matted down, and I didn‚Äôt know what was wrong.
 I switched back to something as simple as suave, and that greasy feeling disappeared.
 I also have very thick hair, and some shampoos do mat it down, so maybe pantene works better for thin hair.
 Overall, I didn‚Äôt enjoy or see any good results from this haircare product   Reply Link      Mandy May 27, 2016, 2:31 pm   I use pantene a lot as I have a lot of thin wavy to curly hair.
 I grew it out for over a year without cutting it.
 Colored the roots, let the streaking grow put to nice ombre.
 I though used my straightener a lot before I met my current guy.
 He doesn‚Äôt care if I straighten my hair and so my incentives was diwn to straighten it.
 But my hair grew out very damaged.
 I think it‚Äôs because of dying the roots, the weather and straightening I did.
 I used mostly salon shampoos (enjoy, tedken) but did not notice much change.
 I started using patene for color more often and suave.
 Same.
 I use mostly on the ends.
 Btw, I have tried not washing my ends.
 They get greasy.
 I concentrate on the scalp for shampoo.
 I also tried sebastian clear cellophane.
 It didn‚Äôt do much.
 I finally had 6 inches cut off.
 My hair is in great condition now.
 I will keep it right past my shoulders and use pantene and my regime conditioners, orange oil, cellophane every once in awhile.
 I streaked and did my own roots before I got it cut.
 Afterwards, it looks very natural.
 I paid 20$ for the hair cut.
 I‚Äôm thinking I just need to get my hair trimmed more.
 I‚Äôm 48 and my hair isn‚Äôt the sane as when I was 18.
 However it looks pretty good now.
 Reply Link      Danielle June 20, 2016, 7:45 am   Although others may not have had the same experience, I used it for 4 weeks.
 It left a gooey type of trail on my hairline.
 I did my research &amp; talked to multiple stylist &amp; a doctor (thought it could be medical) just to find out that the shampoo &amp; conditioner was leaving wax build up in my hair.
 I switched to designline products (Walmart &amp; regis salons carry it) &amp; within a couple months the build up was completely gone (it took a lot of washing to get rid of the dandruff looking stuff from the wax).
 I have very long &amp; thick hair so I would strongly recommend steering clear of any products by pantene.
 Reply Link      Mary Ware June 21, 2016, 8:46 am   No doubt about that Pantene is a very good product but sorry to say that it didn‚Äôt works on my hair.
 I use GKhair moisturizing shampoo that is sulfate free for my dry, brittle and dull hair that are so prone to fall and break so easily.
 I use this very shampoo for the past 3 years and it did wonders on my dull hair.
 I would highly recommend it to anyone who is suffering from dry, brittle and dull hair and wants to have beautiful, healthy and shiny hair.
 üôÇ   Reply Link      Nena June 21, 2016, 3:33 pm   So what‚Äôs the Ph of the Pantene shampoos?
 Think this must be as important as the ingredients.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller June 21, 2016, 4:19 pm   The pH is about 6.
 It is important but it isn‚Äôt a very differentiating factor because almost all shampoos are in the range 5 to 7.
 The ingredients are really much more important.

 Im new to Pantene and just love it!
 Would you happen to have any suggestions on what to buy?
 I have curly frizzy dry hair and sometimes straighten it.
 Im looking for shampoo and conditioner, leave in conditioner, shiny serum, and long lasting scent for my hair!
 Are these the right things I should be looking for?
 Do I need all of these things?
 And what Pantene products do you suggest?
 Reply Link          Ede September 15, 2016, 10:33 pm   I‚Äôve used Pantene for years‚Äìabout 12 to be exact‚Äìand never had any real issues until it had gotten longer.
 I did try other names‚ÄìL‚Äôoreal, Suave, forgotton dollar store stuff, Jason (which i loved, but was too spendy for me), Avalon (also loved)‚Äìbut always came back to Pantene, which seemed to give my short hair the best softness and strength despite harsh coloring and heat styling I put it through.
 There was always a dreadful build-up on my scalp, but my hair was nice, and no flaky dandruff, so I didn‚Äôt care.
 My hair was always short, never got it much longer than to my shoulders.
 Finally, couple years ago I buzzed it all off, deciding to start over‚Äìno coloring, straightening, or blow-drying‚Äìjust let it grow.
 It reaches the middle of my shoulder blades now, and Pantene is no longer working.
 My curls have become unmanagable, frizzy, and so consistently breaking I nearly cut all my hair off again due to how frustrating it had been.
 I tried all I could find of Pantene‚Äôs to manage the frizz and curls‚Ä¶ and everything works for a couple hours, then it just frizzes back out.
 I got my hair cut today; my first time in a JC Penny, and certainly the most I‚Äôve spent on a haircut (but was worth it).
 After asking me what shampoo I used and hearing I used Pantene, she did tell me they used plastics.
 Which is why I‚Äôm here today.
 I needed to look into it.
 I did buy a Redkin product that I‚Äôm hopeful will help tame my mane, but no shampoos or conditioners.
 She recommended Mane ‚Äòn Tail, which I‚Äôll give a try.
 I‚Äôd like to say, mostly, that I do think Pantene is just fine.
 It‚Äôs no longer the product for me, my hair is adamant on that.
 But I think it‚Äôs not all that bad.
 If you‚Äôre insistent that it has harmful chemicals, guarantee so does the salon stuff.
 Go to natural products if chemicals are your issue (I love coconut oil for moisture, but doesn‚Äôt always tame my frizzies).
 I would buy purely from natural stores if I could afford to.
 But, Pantene is just fine.
 I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have gone so long with it otherwise.
 It‚Äôs just a matter of what your hair wants and needs.

 Reply Link      Aussie Mick October 22, 2016, 11:30 am   Now my eyes and brain hurt from an information and opinion overload‚Ä¶ Lets just simplify the facts.
 Artificial chemicals are bad for humans, chemicals are man made poisons.
 Some chemicals can harbour bacteria that is completely alien to earth and exist only because of human interference with nature eg: diesel and petrol can harbour bacteria once the chemical stabilizers break down or evaporate.
 Any cosmetic products are capable of the same bacterial breakdown.
 Cancer is a by-product of the industrial revolution which none of us can live without because we love our carcinogen based necessities like plastic toothbrushes, plastic hormone manipulating food and beverage containers, plastic new car smell, plastic food (McPoison) that some people manage to raise children on with severe nutrient deficiencies and then let a Doctor label them ADHD so they get prescribed plastic tablets to benefit shareholders of giant chemical factories who couldn‚Äôt care less about the millions of temporarily focused health compromised anhedonia time bombs they create, shampoo YES ITS PLASTIC try putting a flame to it and see if it smells different to any other burning chemicals!
 But at the end of the day some people are fitness and health fanatics and get cancer in their twenties, some people smoke, drink heavily and are exposed to highly toxic environments at work every day of their life and the live forever.
 If you want silky hair that smells like a cupids armpit use pantene.
 If you want silky hair AND SKIN grab a $2 box of bi-carb of soda.
 Some people have allergic reactions to pantene and they have a right to their own opinion based on their experiences, most people have a high tolerance due to a toxicity immersed lifestyle of alcohol, red bulls, make-up, perfume, hair dye and plastic fake nails glued their bodies with toxic resin used in the production of fibreglass so a bit of pantene doesn‚Äôt bother them.
 I‚Äôm a Boilermaker, my job exposes me to some of the most carcinogenic materials known to man and yes; i buy pantene when its half price at Coles which seems to be every time i need shampoo‚Ä¶ The fact is its bad bad stuff engineered to perform and marketed to bring in the dollars for shareholders.
 The world is driven by greed and lies but at the end of the day my hair and my Rottweiler smell like cupids armpits and shine like optic fibres.
 I have accepted Jesus Christ into my life as my Savior so a bit of chemical here or there will only get me by His side faster anyway.
 This world is temporary and anyone who has bothered to see what the Bible says will know these are the final days and the only thing that matters is the Salvation of your soul!
 The Old Testament predicted Jesus‚Äô birth, life and crucifixion approximately 700 years BC.
 All time is measured to and from Jesus: BEFORE CHRIST and AFTER DEATH.
 This year is 2016 years AFTER CHRISTS DEATH.
 Which ain‚Äôt long compared to eternity‚Ä¶ Every year people celebrate CHRIST MAS for all the wrong reasons and EASTER IS ABOUT RABBITS THAT LAY EGGS RIGHT???
 Please get your heads out of the sand people, God cares not what toxic shampoo you use or don‚Äôt use in this temporary life‚Ä¶ Get your priorities right and you won‚Äôt care either.

 It was always a staple hair wash to grab in the store until recently.
 I had been experiencing what I can only describe as chronic dandruff.
 EW!
 My scalp would build up large amounts of skin that were highly visible and peel like a bad case of dandruff.
 I was always unsure why as I wash my hair at least 3 times a week (the recommended amount) and even sometimes with anti ‚Äì dandruff shampoos.
 All of this happened when I was using Pantene.
 I began to turn to the fact that maybe it was my trusty hairwash causing these problems.
 So I switched hair wash and within days my dandruff case was completely gone.
 I could wear my usual style of a part down the middle and my head no longer resembled a snow globe.
 I tried a few more different hair washes and no dandruff.
 So i switched back to Pantene just to see and YUP!
 Dandruff.
 The next morning I woke up with that same build up on my scalp.
 SO long story short, Pantene gave me chronic dandruff so I don‚Äôt recommend it unless you‚Äôre planning on having a white Christmas this year.
 üôÇ   Reply Link      Laura December 11, 2016, 4:23 pm   I have been using Pantene for at least fifteen years.
 I have hair to my waist that is extremely thick.
 I have always received compliments on my hair for the look, smell and feel of it.
 Over the years I have been a unpaid spokes person for Pantene, convincing friends, family &amp; neighbors to try it.
 I have been to salons where the stylists have tried to convince me on how bad it was.
 It never phased me.
 I would go home and go right back to my Pantene.
 I have had no desire to try any other product because I have been so happy with Pantene.
 Unfortunately, something has changed in the last few months.
 I‚Äôm not sure if they changed their ingredients but after showering my hair looks oily.
 The more I shower, the oilier it looks.
 It looked like I hadn‚Äôt bathed in a month.
 I actually called the store where I bought it, thinking it had been tampered with.
 I explained that I believed kids had mixed baby oil in it.
 After buying several different bottles with the same result.
 I came to the conclusion that it was in fact the Pantene that was making my hair look like this.
 Not only have I found that my hair was looking oily but also it wasn‚Äôt smelling as good.
 The fragrance also has seemed to of changed.
 To my disappointment, I had to start trying other brands.
 My 19 year old niece came to visit just a few months ago &amp; asked why I had quit using Pantene.
 I explained tell her what had happened &amp; why I had to stop.
 She was saddened and relieved at the same time because she was experiencing the same thing with her hair.
 I‚Äôm not really sure what has happened to the product but I am very disappointed.
 I have been a loyal customer for many, many years and would love to go back to using it.
 Untill then I will settle for these other brands.
 After all I want to look clean &amp; not homeless.
 Reply Link      Tanya January 10, 2017, 12:56 am   I used Pantene Pro V for one week.
 It made my hair feel and look beautiful.
 I have a naturally oily scalp and I‚Äôm sad to say that it created so much buildup on my hair.
 I had to stop and use a clarifying shampoo.
 It still did not work so I moved on to the original Head and Shoulders.
 No more buildup, my hair felt so clean, and there was no smelly scalp.
 I guess it depends on the type of hair and scalp an individual has.
 It might work wonders for others, but it just wasn‚Äôt for me.
 I loved it but it was not fit for oily scalps like mine.

 And yes, it makes my hair verrry itchy and greasy.
 Pantene is for the frizzy only.
 Instead of using coconut oil, this is what Pantene is for.. to make ur hair a little greasyer than usual but to calm ur hair down.
 Reply Link      Jolene April 12, 2017, 6:25 am   Well to begin with, your actual strands of hair are basically dead.
 The idea is to keep the shaft smooth and moisturised so that your hair doesn‚Äôt break.
 I have had long hair my entire life, and after having used very costly, and some not as costly, but still costly natural shampoos, conditioners and the like, I have to say that not much difference has been made to the health of my hair ‚Äì and I‚Äôm talking about the strands.
 Hair health begins with what you eat and how you treat your body.
 You need a vitamin rich, balanced diet.
 From there, you need to protect your head of hair.
 On some of the natural stuff, my hair tangled terribly.
 With other options in one particular range, it was slightly better, but I still needed leave-in conditioner and hair oil to prevent knotting.
 My hair knots like crazy and splits no matter what I use.
 So I decided ‚Äòbugger that‚Äô and bought good old Pantene again, along with a split end serum.
 While I can feel some build on on my hair, it isn‚Äôt knotting as much and it feels smoother.
 Time will tell.
 But if I think back to decades ago when you couldn‚Äôt get all these natural and expensive products, my hair was always beautiful and in great condition.
 I do use a hot oil treatment of coconut oil, olive oil, vitamin e oil and castor oil every week or two.
 Makes a big difference no matter what shampoo and conditioner I use.
 Bottom line, eat well, and find products that work for you and protect the hair shaft.
 Oh and incidentally I was the marketer for a large, premium international brand of organic hair colour and care‚Ä¶ so I know the spin they use üòâ and very well how their products work and feel.
 Reply Link      Christopher April 19, 2017, 7:45 am   A friend just last week texted me and asked me what I use on my hair because I have ridiculously awesome hair.
 I told him, Living Proof, but I haven‚Äôt been loyal to any one brand really and that it might be hard for him to that stuff out in the burbs.
 I remembered this post and seeing Randy say in other places that they were well formulated products and I told him to give Pantene a try, which is cheaper and easily found.
 Three days later he texted me he‚Äôs been using Pantene and can already see a difference.

 Reply Link        Christina April 27, 2017, 8:24 pm   My personal experience with Pantene has been awful.
 I have very thick, curly hair.
 Pantene makes my hair so greasy, frizzy, damaged looking, many strands of hair fall out more than any other shampoo I used, my scalp itches so bad, and my curls turn into knots.
 If it works for you guys that wonderful but I would not recommend Pantene to anyone.

 Looks very interesting!
 I am on my final year of my Biomolecular Sciences degree.
 I have modules of Genetics, Immunology, Microbiology, Cellular Biology, etc, so even though I love Science and understand it my Chemistry knowledge is of course very limited.
 I think people need to stop being rude.
 Doing an Applied Science degree doesn‚Äôt make anyone a Chemistry expert.
 The arrogance in some of these posts is unbelievable.
 Thank you Randy for the facts and the Science!
 If people want BAD SCIENCE, the type that is postulated by hairdressers and many times the media, which often starts with ‚Äúharsh chemicals‚Äù, go elsewhere then!

 It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre using $38 Alterna Caviar shampoo, which is the best shampoo you can buy for your hair or $5 Pantene, if you use the same shampoo day in and day out for too long your hair becomes immune to it.
 You need to change up your shampoos frequently.
 Hair masks and serums are the things that are going to give you long term results.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller May 24, 2017, 7:55 am   Hi Simone.
 Actually the idea that your hair becomes immune to shampoo is a myth.
 We researched this several years ago and couldn‚Äôt find any evidence of a mechanism for this.

 I have a bachelors degree in Microbiology and am applying to doctoral programs now and I just got lectured by my hairdresser for using Pantene.

 I‚Äôve read you saying that Pantene products are meant to be used together.
 Why is that so?
 I don‚Äôt like the sodium lauryl sulfate in their shampoos, but I do like Pantene conditioners.
 Can I use a Pantene conditioner with my sulfate-free shampoo?
 For the record, my shampoo five first ingredients are: Aqua, sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, cocamidopropyl betaine, glycerin, Sorbeth-450 Tristearate, PEG-9 cocoate, PEG-32 distearate PEG-175 distearate, PEG-8 coco glucoside dimethicone‚Ä¶.
 Will it work?
 Thank you.
 Reply Link      Renato July 6, 2017, 9:20 am   Sorry, I said in the comment before that you said pantene shampoos and conditioners are meant to be used together, but I think it was from Pantene‚Äôs press release they send to you.
 But I still want to know if my shampoo will work with pantene conditioner.
 Reply Link      Randy Schueller July 7, 2017, 6:39 am   Hi Renato.
 In most cases you can mix shampoos and conditioners of different brands and they will work just fine.
 Reply Link        Anna July 23, 2017, 3:10 pm   I have dry curly hair.
 I am 54 now so I color it.
 I also have a background in Cosmetology and chemical treatment.
 I loved Optimum Olive Repair but it is no longer sold in my area.
 So I tried Pantene Repair and Protect.
 I love it just as much.
 Just for the record, silicone is great for my hair.
 It works on frizz by coating the hair shaft.
 Many shops do a silicone treatment to cover frizz so I don‚Äôt see what the uproar is about.
 My hair looks great and I will never change.
 Not even for Optimum.
 I will make a suggestion though for those who get build-up.
 Just mix a teaspoon of baking soda in your shampoo once a month.
 Then shampoo again and condition.
 There ya go.
 Build up under control without going to the hair shops for expensive clarifying treatments.
 Reply Link      Roy Chefets August 21, 2017, 12:49 pm   You are so right about P&amp;G. They will not let a competitor have a better product than theirs.
 A famous dermatologist in New York told me that Oil of Olay products, also made by P&amp;G are as good as anything on the market.
 Yet people waste billions on department store brands that are no better.
 Stay away from department store cosmetic counters.
 The stuff costs pennies to make; the big expense is advertising to try to con you into thinking the products are exclusive and somehow better.
 P&amp;G sells $50 Billion worth of their products every year.
 Do you really think they are going to let a competitor have something better?
 The sales women at department store counters are on commission.
 Plus they know zero about skin, hair, color cosmetics.

 September 26, 2017, 6:21 pm   Pantene shampoo &amp; conditioner made my hair very dry and caused severe breakage but that was many years ago.
 So, Recently, I had asked my beautician to recommend a product for my (9 yr. Old) daughters hair ‚Äì she recommended Pantene.
 Guess what ?
 My daughters hair experienced severe breakage, Splint ends and Dry itchy scalp.
 Now, Her once shoulder length hair can barely be gathered into pigtails (Its maybe 4-1/2 inches long).
 I understand it is a very popular product with Rave reviews BUT it Delivered ‚ÄòHorrendous‚Äô results on this end.
 Reply Link      E April 7, 2019, 12:29 am   Initially when I started using the Pantene products, I liked the way my hair looked and felt, however over few months I have noticed my hair just like the other reviewers indicated, got thinner (weird thinness, that is just out of place,) and the scalp would start to itch severely in the areas where the hair is turning thin.
 The hair strands start to look like a stringy gelatinous mess, instead of normal hair.
 Moreover just like most of the reviewers indicated, I have never experienced the amount of hair falling out in the shower, after I started using Pantene Products.

 I was also taught in school that certain products coat the hair, Pantene being the worst of all.
 If this isn‚Äôt true, can you explain why I always have colour issues with Pantene users?
 Including my first big salon visit when I was suggested Pantene but then my hair started to break off during highlights?
 Note, I‚Äôve bleached my hair multiple times since that event 10 years ago with no issue.
 I would really like to better inform my clients.

 When I first tried it again about 2 years ago and I still won‚Äôt use it.
 I didn‚Äôt like the way it left my hair greasy and flat ( I used it according to instructions; maybe a little less).
 I was finally introduced to ‚ÄúWEN‚Äù and I have been happy ever since.
 This cleansing conditioner doesn‚Äôt suds up ( which I have found it strips the hair).

 I still have to wash everyday or wear my hair up.
 But I agree with finding a formula that doesn‚Äôt make your scalp itch or leave too heavy of a fragrance.
 Pantene is too heavily fragranced for me.

 Reply Link      Jennifer January 13, 2018, 2:13 pm   So I was told years ago by my stylist friend to never use Pantene because it was bad for your hair.
 Before this, for YEARS I used it and loved the way it made my hair feel.
 After her suggestion I stopped using it and the past few years I‚Äôve tried sooo many different shampoos and conditioners and NONE of them were good for my hair.
 My hair is thin and colored so it‚Äôs brittle.
 Amway, all the ones I used made my hair very tangled, flat and not soft AT ALL.
 It was starting to fall out really bad too.
 Just the other day I said screw it, I‚Äôve had zero luck with anything else so I‚Äôm going to try Pantene again.
 Just washed it today and omg how much I‚Äôve missed it!
 I don‚Äôt know specifics about the products, but I do know what I experienced.
 I am mad at myself for listening to someone else.
 As someone else previously said, I think it depends on the person.
 We are all not the same.

 She said it will take a very long time for my hair to regain it‚Äôs health.
 She even noticed my hair felt waxy.
 She noticed how bad my hair was BEFORE I mentioned the name of the shampoo.
 I‚Äôm really sad.
 My hair was once beautiful.

 I don‚Äôt be know what to do.
 Reply Link      Perry Romanowski April 3, 2018, 8:20 am   You won‚Äôt lose your hair because of Pantene.
 Some stylists tell you things like that because they want you to buy expensive salon brands.
 It‚Äôs not hard to guess that you use Pantene since it is the most popular shampoo brand.
 Reply Link        rissa February 27, 2018, 5:31 pm   I typically use lush, but not everyone is down for bar shampoos so after having guests i bought a huge bottle from sams for them to enjoy.

 But i noticed my hair has been falling out a lot more after using it, and i mean a lot.
 I got tested for thyroid disease, pcos, and diabetes to see if that was the cause.

 Reply Link        Janet May 26, 2018, 8:00 pm   I‚Äôve never used salon brands.
 My hair was always my best feature, in my opinion.
 I‚Äôd switch between Pantene, Aussie, and Fructis shampoo ‚Äì always the volumizing formulas.
 I‚Äôd use one brand for a while and then switch off to another brand for a while.
 I always had bottles of each in the bathroom.
 Over the past year, for whatever reason, I stuck with Pantene.
 After a couple of months of using only Pantene, I noticed that my scalp became very itchy all the time, to the point where I was looking for lice!
 (None, thankfully.)
 I also noticed acne-like pimples, like whiteheads, would appear here and there on my scalp.
 This was something I‚Äôd never had before.
 Most alarmingly, the hair on the crown of my head was clearly thinning significantly.
 I blamed it on my age (late 60s).
 I spoke with my hairdresser about it ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt try to sell me salon product, but she didn‚Äôt ask what shampoo I was using at home, either.
 I never thought to blame the Pantene.
 Until one day it occurred to me that the only thing I‚Äôd been doing differently over the past months was exclusively using Pantene shampoo (I‚Äôve never needed conditioner).
 So I stopped using it.
 Within a day or two my scalp no longer itched and the pimples disappeared.
 Within a couple of months, the hair on the crown of my head was obviously getting fuller, the way it used to be.
 Do I blame Pantene for my problems?
 Absolutely.
 Did I know that Pantene had a ‚Äúreputation‚Äù for issues?
 Not at all.
 But I found out once I‚Äôd thrown my Pantene away.
 Was my problem an individual allergy or something that cropped up after my having used it on and off for years?
 Maybe.
 But I know I‚Äôll never use it again, nor recommend it to anybody else.
 Reply Link      Charity August 8, 2018, 12:08 am   I‚Äôve used cheap shampoo, expensive shampoo, and everything in between.
 I have a giant warehouse size pantene shampoo &amp; conditioner in my shower.
 I have fine hair that gets weighed down easily.
 I don‚Äôt use pantene every day.
 Once every week or two I use a clarifying shampoo, and it removes any build up others may have deposited on my hair.
 I really don‚Äôt notice much difference between salon products vs pantene.
 It‚Äôs all about rotation of products.
 If your hair is feeling brittle, or oily and coated, clarifying it with a clarifying shampoo, using a good conditioner with some coconut oil in it, brings it right back.
 Whenever I‚Äôm in the salon, the ask, what shampoo I‚Äôm using and I know the upsell is around the corner.
 I found if I just mention a brand they sell, they shut up and and tell me how my hair is in such great condition.
 Frankly, it‚Äôs all about perception, with salon vs pantene.
 A lot of salon brands are filled with silicone too.
 The very same cones hairdressers are railing against in the comments, that are in pantene.
 Any shampoo over time can deposit ingredients that build up.
 Price point and label appeal ingredients do nothing other than give you the perception it‚Äôs working better.
 Truth is, look at the first 5 ingredients, and once you reach the preservation system or fragrance, it‚Äôs all below the 1% percentage of the formulary, and is basically there for label appeal.
 There is nothing wrong with Pantene.
 It all comes down to personal preference and that‚Äôs the freedom of choice.
 Some of the comments here are so disrespectful.
 Keep up the good work guys, and know that I appreciate your blog.

 Reply Link      Christal Niles December 30, 2018, 12:25 pm   As a professional stylist I find this article rude.
 I was notntold this by a sales rep, it was a chemistry project we did in cosmetology school, which showed with repeated washings the Pantene Pro V specifically (never tested any other Pantene product) left a thick waxy buildup that even a perm with a PH of 8.5-9 couldn‚Äôt break through.
 You can take a blade of a pair of scissors, scrape down hair that has had repeated washings with this product and literally scrape the buildup off.
 Ensenuating that cosmetologists have 0 science background or any additional Education other than cosmetology school is ignorant and disrespectful to the entire beauty industry, not to mention giving incorrect info in this article.
 Reply Link      Perry Romanowski February 26, 2019, 4:04 pm   You‚Äôre being misinformed if you think running a pair of scissors down the hair shaft shows scraping off buildup.
 You‚Äôre actually scraping off hair cuticle.
 No rudeness is intended.
 I encourage you to educate yourself and consider that the things you learned in cosmetology school may not have been science based.
 Just something to think about.
 Reply Link        John January 20, 2019, 3:12 am   Do you know the ph range Pantene is formulated at?
 Is it important to use a shampoo that is slightly acidic (ph of 5.5) to match the acid mantle of our skin/scalp?
 Reply Link      Perry Romanowski January 21, 2019, 12:34 pm   Pantene pH is between 5 ‚Äì 6.
 It‚Äôs not crucial that the pH of a shampoo be 5.5 but most of them are except baby shampoos which are formulated closer to neutral.
 Reply Link        John January 20, 2019, 3:18 am   I use minoxidil foam and the manufacturer recommends to avoid shampoos that contain silicones as they can potentially coat the scalp and prevent absorption of the minoxidil.

 Reply Link      Cheralee November 15, 2019, 3:50 pm   Hello, I‚Äôve just recently bought Pantene but haven‚Äôt used it yet.
 I do suffer from hair loss and have researched this topic extensively as well as seen doctors and specialists.
 Trust me, you cannot ever declare that any product (just shampoo and conditioners) causes hair loss.
 Everyone is always going through a hair growth cycle and most times, it‚Äôs merely a coincidence that your hair shedding just so happened to correspond with the time that you decided to try a new shampoo.
 If Pantene or any other cheap brand caused hair loss then trust me, everyone who uses it would stop buying it instantly.
 Also, in the hair growth cycle, there is also a time when your hair stops shedding and all of a sudden starts growing again, the new hair.
 This just so happens to be the time when people then say things like ‚Äù Oh well I bought this and that product and now my hair is growing again!‚Äù Hair loss / growth is not determined by which products you use but it is determined by what‚Äôs going on inside your body.
 It‚Äôs also not necessarily to do with how healthy/unhealthy you are as I‚Äôve seen alcoholics and drug addicts with full heads of hair and I partake in none of those.
 However, this amazing person called an endocrinologist has confirmed to me my hair loss is all to do with my body producing more or a hormone than it should be and as a result, I now know which medication I need to use and as another result my hair loss slows down whenever I take those meds.
 So, it‚Äôs a very, very big deal indeed when people claim that a certain shampoo ACTUALLY MAKES their hair fall out because 9.9 times out of 10, no it doesn‚Äôt.
 I feel that almost 90% of people out there have been using grocery store shampoo products their whole life and none of these people have hair loss.
 If your hair is falling out to an excess (scalp shows) and is not growing ‚Äì go see your doctor.

 Every time I go to the salon for a haircut, I am complimented on how healthy my hair looks and feels.
 They are always blow away when I reveal my dirty, shameful secret (insert sarcasm here) that I only use Pantene!
 I have tried the more expensive salon brands that claim to be ‚Äúthe best,‚Äù but they totally destroyed my hair!

 It is what has always worked for my hair and has never let me down.
 I‚Äôve heard all of the horror stories from stylists and other random people who think they know it all about how damaging Pantene is for your hair.
 However, I have had nothing but a positive experience with this brand in the 25+ years I have been using it.
 My hair has never fallen out, it is not dry, weighed down, or stripped.
 It is thick, luxurious, shiny, soft, and healthy.
 Every single stylist who has ever touched my hair always comments on how healthy it is and they are blown away when I tell them that I all I use is Pantene.
 My favorite is the Classic Clean line.
 It has been my go-t0 shampoo and conditioner for many, many years.
 I have occasionally tried other brands, including the more expensive salon brands, over the years that are touted to be ‚Äúthe best,‚Äù but they all made my hair look and feel terrible!!!!
 They dried out my hair horribly and made it feel so weighed down and difficult to manage.
 Never again!
 I always end up going right back to my trusty Pantene.
 I have finally learned to never stray from it.
 I don‚Äôt care what anyone says about the brand.
 My hair speaks for itself.

 It was to the point where my mother bought me an ‚Äúanti-static‚Äù brush to try to get rid of the static.
 I wish she‚Äôd changed my shampoo instead.
 I tried so many different shampoos intended for dry hair ‚Äì Garnier Fructis, Finesse, Herbal Essences, whatever.
 I still had problems with static.
 Then I hit on Pantene‚Äôs formula for dry hair ‚Äì and bingo.
 NO MORE STATIC.
 They keep changing exactly what the product looks like and how it‚Äôs named, so I find that rather frustrating, but I do find it over and over again because it‚Äôs worth it.
 While I‚Äôm sure salon products could give me as good a result, the price isn‚Äôt comparable.
 Pantene is inexpensive.
 My mother recently made me doubt whether Pantene was the right solution: I do have split ends.
 But, my hair is over a foot long and I cut it about once a year.
 I wear it in a ponytail all the time.
 I only recently learned I shouldn‚Äôt be brushing my hair while it‚Äôs wet.
 So I don‚Äôt think my split ends are caused by Pantene; it‚Äôs probably the other things I‚Äôm doing that cause split ends.
 Unless proven otherwise I don‚Äôt want to give up my Pantene!
