 The department on Monday issued a temporary suspension order on  the license of Valley Springs Manor, as well as the licenses for associated  facilities in Oakland and in Modesto, that took effect Thursday, according to  spokesman Michael Weston.
 The facility came to the attention of law enforcement Saturday after  responders to a medical call found a skeleton staff struggling to care for  around 14 elderly residents, according to Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt.
 J.D.
 Nelson.
 The patients were moved out to hospitals and other locations and  sheriff's officials launched an investigation that could potentially result  in elder abuse charges, Nelson said.
 Weston said county social services officials, working in  cooperation with his department, had checked on the facility as recently as  Saturday morning and understood the patients would be cared for over the weekend  while new places were found for them.
 "I can tell you that the department has been engaged with this  facility for quite a while and there is a history of concerns," Weston said.
 "Apparently what happened is that the facility staff felt that  they were starting to lose the capability to care for these individuals, so  they called for help," Weston said of today's events.
 State officials revoked the license for the Castro Valley facility  at 17926 Apricot Way and for Eden Manor, a facility at 3121 Fruitvale Avenue  in Oakland, effective Thursday evening, according to a complaint filed  Monday.
 A facility in Modesto was also included in the complaint.
 All three were operated by Herminigilda "Hilda" N. Manuel and Mary  Julleah N. Manuel, according to the complaint.
 The complaint alleges a long list of violations at all three  facilities, some of them dating back as far as 2008.
 Many of the allegations  include issues such as failing to conduct criminal background checks on  employees and properly train employees to making false statements to  regulators, as well as problems with maintenance and cleanliness.
 However, other alleged incidents include patients failing to  receive necessary medications and suffering diabetic episodes or seizures as  a result, and patient falls and injuries that weren't treated or reported  properly.
 Some patients were moved from one facility to another without  being given a choice and without proper notification of family members, the  complaint alleged.
 Regulators found alleged fire regulation violations at the Castro  Valley facility in March including doors that locked patients inside and  obstructed pathways.
 At least one client with dementia was insufficiently supervised  and had to be returned to the Castro Valley facility by police, the complaint  alleged.
 By the middle of this month, regulators found insufficient staff  at all three facilities to provide basic care for patients.
 "There was only one caregiver, one cook, one assistant cook and  one housekeeper to care for 24 residents on Sept. 30, 2013," the complaint  alleges.
 State officials are seeking to permanently revoke the licenses for  all three facilities and to prohibit Hilda Manuel and Mary Manuel from  further employment or contact with any facility licensed by the Department of  Social Services.
