 They languish in pain, ache with loneliness, and long to be free from animal testing.
 Instead, all they can do is sit and wait in fear of the next terrifying and painful procedure that will be performed on them.
 A lack of environmental enrichment and the stress of their living situation cause some animals to develop neurotic types of behavior such as incessantly spinning in circles, rocking back and forth, pulling out their own fur, and even biting themselves.
 After enduring a life of pain, loneliness, and terror, almost all of them will be killed.PETA is at the forefront of stopping this abuse.
 Our dedicated team of scientists and other staff members work full time exposing the cruelty of animal tests in order to ensure their imminent end.
 This team collaborates with members of Congress to introduce groundbreaking legislation to replace the use of animals in laboratories, spearheads hard-hitting eyewitness exposés and public campaigns that have been pivotal in shifting public opinion against animal testing, and persuades major corporations, government agencies, and universities to abandon animal tests in favor of modern, non-animal methods.
 PETA’s Animal Experimentation VictoriesTechnologically advanced non-animal test methods can be used in place of animal testing.
 Not only are these tests more humane, they also have the potential to be cheaper, faster, and more relevant to humans.While some of the experimentation conducted on animals today is required by law, most of it isn’t.
 In fact, a number of countries have implemented bans on the testing of certain types of consumer goods on animals, such as the cosmetics-testing bans in the European Union, India, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, and elsewhere.
