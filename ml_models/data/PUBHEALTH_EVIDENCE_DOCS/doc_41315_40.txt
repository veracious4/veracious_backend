 This has in recent times become a major public health issue with vaccine preventable diseases increasing in the community due to the fear of a ‘link’ between vaccinations and autism.
 We performed a meta-analysis to summarise available evidence from case-control and cohort studies on this topic (MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar up to April, 2014).
 Eligible studies assessed the relationship between vaccine administration and the subsequent development of autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
 Two reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, methods, and outcomes.
 Disagreement was resolved by consensus with another author.
 Five cohort studies involving 1,256,407 children, and five case-control studies involving 9,920 children were included in this analysis.
 The cohort data revealed no relationship between vaccination and autism (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.06) or ASD (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.20), nor was there a relationship between autism and MMR (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.01), or thimerosal (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.31), or mercury (Hg) (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.07).
 Findings of this meta-analysis suggest that vaccinations are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder.
 Furthermore, the components of the vaccines (thimerosal or mercury) or multiple vaccines (MMR) are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder.Previous article in issueNext article in issueKeywordsVaccineVaccinationImmunisationAutismAutism spectrum disorderThimerosalMercuryRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
