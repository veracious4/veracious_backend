Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey Wednesday for their leadership in reaching an agreement on expanded background checks for gun buyers.
 "This is not my bill, and there are aspects of the agreement that I might prefer to be stronger.
 But the agreement does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress," he said in a statement.
 "It recognizes that there are good people on both sides of this issue, and we don’t have to agree on everything to know that we’ve got to do something to stem the tide of gun violence."
 The deal reached by Manchin and Toomey would require background checks for sales at gun shows and online, but it will exempt personal transfers, for example to family or friends.
 It would also create a commission to study the causes and prevention of mass shootings.
 The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on whether the measure can proceed.
 Obama cautioned Wednesday that "a lot of work remains."
 "Congress needs to finish the job.
 The Senate must overcome obstruction by defeating a threatened filibuster, and allow a vote on this and other commonsense reforms to protect our kids and our communities.
 Any bill still has to clear the House," he said.
 "So I’m going to keep asking the American people to stand up and raise their voices, because these measures deserve a vote – and so do the families and communities they’re designed to protect."
