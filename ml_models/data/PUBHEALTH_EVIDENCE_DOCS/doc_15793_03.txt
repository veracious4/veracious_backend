 Monitor
ing the Future (MTF) is a long
-term study of 
American adolescents, college students, and adult
 high school graduate
s 
through age 5
5.  It has been 
conducted annually by the University of Michigan™s 
Institute for Social Research since its inception in 
1975 and is supported under a series of investigator
-initiated, competing research grants from the National 

Institute on Drug Abuse.
 The need fo
r a study such as MTF is clear
.  Substance 
use by American young people has proven to be a 

rapidly changing phenomenon, requiring frequent 

assessments and reassessments
.  Since the mid
-1960s, 
when it burgeoned in the general you
th population, 
illicit drug use has remained a major concern for the 
nation
.  Smoking, drinking, and illicit drug use are 
leading causes of morbidity and mortality
 during 
adolescence as well as later in life
.  How vigorously 

the nation responds to tee
nage substance use, how 
accurately it identifies the emerging substance abuse 

problems, and how well it comes to understand the 
effectiveness of policy and intervention efforts largely 
depend on the ongoing collection of valid and reliable 

data
.  MTF
 is uniquely designed to generate such data 
in order to provide an accurate picture of what is 

happening in this domain and why, and the study has 
served that function well for the past 
40 years
.  Policy 
discussions in the 
scientific literature and 
media, in 
government, education, public health institutions, and 
elsewhere have been informed by the ready 

availability of extensive and consistently accurate 
information from the study relating to a large 
and 
ever
-growing 
number 
of substances
.  Similarly, the 
work of organizations and agencies providing 
prevention and treatment services is informed by 

MTF.
 The 201
4 
MTF
 survey encompassed about 
41,600 8th-, 10
th-, and 
12th-grade students in
 3
77 secondary 
schools nationwi
de.  
The first published results are 
presented in this report
.  Recent trends in the use of 
licit and illicit drugs are emphasized, as well as trends 
in the levels of perceived risk and personal 

disapproval associated with each drug
.  This
 project
 has shown these beliefs and attitudes to be particularly 

important in explaining trends in use
.  In addition, 
trends in the perceived availability of each drug are 

presented
, which
 at times have proven important to 
explaining changes in usage levels
. 
A 
synopsis of the design and methods used in the 
study and an overview of the key results from the 

2014 
survey follow this introductory section
.  These 
are in turn followed by a separate section for each 

individual drug class, providing figures that show 
trends in the overall proportions of students at each 
grade level (a) using the drug, (b) seeing a ﬁgreat riskﬂ 

associated with its use (perceived risk), (c) 

disapproving of its use (disapproval), and (d) saying it 

would be fairly or very easy to
 get if they wanted to 
(perceived availability)
.  For 
12th graders
, 
annual data 
are available since 1975 and for 
8th and 10
th graders 
since 1991, the first year they were included in the 

study.
 The tables at 
the end of this report provide the 
statistics underlying the figures; in addition, they 

present data on lifetime, annual, 30
-day, and (for 
selected drugs) daily prevalence.
1 For the sake of 
brevity, we present these prevalence statistics here 

only for the 1991
Œ201
4 
interval, but statistics on 
12th graders 
going back to 1975 
are available 
in other 
MTF publications
.  For each prevalence period, the 
tables indicate which 
one-year changes 
from
 2013 
to
 2014 
are statistically significant

indicate gradual

significance in a given one

 the sample reporting use 
of the given substance on one or more occasions in a given time interval
Še.g., 
lifetime, past 12 months, or
 past 30 days
.  For most drugs, the prevalence of 
daily use refers to reported use on 20 or more occasions in the past 30 days
, except for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, for which actual daily use is 
measured, and for bing
e drinking, defined as having 5+ drinks on at least one 
occasion in the prior two weeks

cigarettes and some tobacco products are 
measured on number of days used in past 30 days.

  Study Design and Methods
Mo
nitoring the Future™s main data collection involves 
a series of large, annual surveys of nationally 
representative samples of public and private 

secondary school students throughout the cot
erminous 
United States
.  Every year since 1975 a national 
sample of 
12th graders has been surveyed
.  In 1991 the 
study was expanded to include comparable, inde
-
pendent national samples of 
8th and 10
th graders
.  The 
year 201
4 
marked the 
40th national survey of 
12th graders and the
 24
th national survey of 
8th and 10
th graders.
 Sample Sizes
 In 2014 
about 
41,600 students in 
377 secondary 
schools participated
 in the study, with
 sample sizes 
of about 15
,2
00, 13,300, and 
13,0
00 in 
8th, 10
th, and 
12th grades, respectively
.  Because multiple questionnaire 
forms are administered randomly at each grade level 
to increase coverage of attitudinal and 
behavioral 

domains relevant to substance use, and because not all 

questions are contained in all forms, the number of 

cases upon which a particular statistic is based may be 
less than the total sample size
.  
The tables here 
contain notes on the number of
 forms used for each 
statistic if less than the total sample is used.
 Field Procedures
 University of Michigan staff members administer the 

questionnaires to students, usually in 
the
 student
 classroom during a regular class period
.  Participation 
is volun
tary
.  Parents are notified well in advance of 
the survey administration and are provided the 
opportunity to decline their child™s participation
.  Questionnaires are self
-completed and are formatted 
for optical scanning.
 In 
8th and 10
th grades the questionnaires are 
completely anonymous, and in 
12th grade they are 
confidential (name and address information is 

gathered to permit the longitudinal follow
-up surveys 
of random subsamples of participants after high 

school)
.  Extensive, car
efully designed procedures are 
followed to protect the confidentiality of the 
participants and their data
.  
All procedures are 
reviewed and approved on an annual basis by the 

University of Michigan™s Institutional Review Board 

(IRB) for compliance with federal guidelines for the 

treatment of human subjects.
 Measures
 A standard set of three questions is used to determine 

usage 
levels for 
most of 
the drugs
.  
For example, we 
ask, ﬁOn how many occasions (if any) have you used 

marijuana 
.  .  
.  
(a) 
.  
.  .  
in your lifetime? (b) 
.  
.  
.  during the past 12 months? (c) 
.  .  .  
during the last 30 
days?ﬂ Each of the three questions is answe
red on the 
same answer scale: 0, 1
Œ2, 3
Œ5, 6Œ9, 10
Œ19, 20
Œ39, 
and 40 or more occasions.
 Fo
r the psychotherapeutic drugs (amphetamines, 
sedatives [barbiturates], tranquilizers, and narcotics 

other than heroin), respondents are instructed to 

include only 
use ﬁ
.  .  .  on your own
Šthat is, without 
a doctor telling you to take them.ﬂ A similar 
qualification is used in the question on use of anabolic 
steroids, OxyContin, Vicodin
, 
and several other drugs.
 Fo
r cigarettes, respondents are asked two questi
ons 
about use.  
First they are asked, ﬁHave you ever 

smoked cigarettes?ﬂ The answer categories are 
ﬁnever,ﬂ ﬁonce or twice,ﬂ 
ﬁoccasionally but not 
regularly,ﬂ ﬁregularly in the past,ﬂ and 
ﬁregularly 
now.ﬂ
 The second question asks, ﬁHow frequent
ly 
have you smoked cigarettes during the past 30 days?ﬂ 

The answer categories are ﬁnot at all,ﬂ ﬁless than one 
cigarette per day,ﬂ ﬁone to five cigarettes per day,ﬂ 
and 
about one
-half
, one, one and a half, and two packs 
per day.
 Sm
okeless tobacco questions parallel those for 
cigarettes
.  There are also questions recently added 
about e
-cigarettes, small cigars, and a number of other 
tobacco products.  
 Their use is asked on a 
prevalence/frequency scale for either the past 12 

mo
nths or the prior 30 days.  
  
Al
cohol use is measured using the three questions 
illustrated above for marijuana
.  A parallel set of three 

questions asks about the frequency of being drunk
.  
Binge drinking 
is assessed with the question
, ﬁHow 
many times (if any) have you had five or more drinks 

in a row
ﬂ 
over the past two weeks?
 Perc
eived risk
 is measured by 
the
 question
, ﬁHow 
much do you think people risk harming themselves 
(physically
 or in other ways), if they
 .  .  .ﬂ 
try or use a drug
Šfor example, 
ﬁ.  .  .  try 
marijuana once or twice
.ﬂ The answer categories are 
 ﬁno
 risk,ﬂ ﬁslight risk,ﬂ ﬁmoderate risk,ﬂ ﬁgreat risk,ﬂ 
and ﬁcan™t say, drug unfamiliar.ﬂ Parallel questions 
re
fer to 
use of
 marijuana
. 
 ﬁoccasionally,ﬂ and
 to
 using it ﬁregularly.ﬂ
 Disapproval
 is measured by the question ﬁDo YOU 
disapprove of people doing each of the following?ﬂ 

followed by ﬁtrying marijuana once or twice,ﬂ for 

example
.  Answer categories are ﬁdon™t disapprove,ﬂ 
ﬁdisapprove,ﬂ and ﬁstrongly disapprove.ﬂ In the 
8th- 
and 10
th
-grade questionnaires, a fourth category
Šﬁcan™t say, drug unfamiliarﬂ
Šis provided and 
included in the calculation of percentages.
 Perceived availability
 is measured by the question 
ﬁHow difficult do you think it would be for you to get 

each of the following types of drugs, if you wanted 
some?ﬂ Answer categories are ﬁprobably impossible,ﬂ 
ﬁvery difficult,ﬂ ﬁfairly difficult,ﬂ ﬁfairly easy,ﬂ and 

ﬁvery easy.ﬂ For 
8th and 10
th graders, an additional 
answer category
Šﬁcan™t say, drug unfamiliarﬂ
Šis 
provided
 and included in the calculation of 
percentages.
  Summary of Key Findings
 As
 an ongoing study, MTF is designed to detect age 
effects, secular trends, and cohort effects in 
substance use and related attitudes and
 beliefs
.  Age 
effects 
(changes with age seen across multiple class 
cohorts) 
are common during adolescence, and we 
typically find that use
, as well as
 positive attitudes 
and beliefs about use
, 
increase across 
8th, 10
th, and 
12th grades
.  When c
hanges over time in substance 
use and related attitudes and beliefs are parallel 

across 
the three grades
, they
 reflect secular trends, 
which
 are also common
.   Co
hort effects pertain to differences in substance 
use and related attitudes and behaviors among those 

born at different times that maintain as the cohorts 

age
.  Such cohort effects sometimes drive changes 

in substance use prevalence at the population level
.  For example, much of the decline in the prevalence 

of U.S.  
cigarette smoking has
 its roots in youth 
cohorts that did not take up smoking and then 

continued to resist smoking as they aged into 

adulthood
.  As subsequent youth
 cohorts continued 
to avoid
 smoking and then grew older, these 
cohorts contributed to a decline in the populati
on 
prevalence of smoking.  
Cohort effects can also act 

in the opposite direction, with newer cohorts taking 

up a substance and continuing to use it as they get 

older
.  One important contribution of the MTF 
study has been the specification of cohort eff
ects 
that emerged 
starting in 
the early 1990s, when an 

increase in youth substance use occurred for many 

drugs
.  The recent increase in e
-cigarette prevalence 
among teens may reflect the beginning of another 

cohort effect
.   MTF
 allows d
etection of c
ohort effects at an early 
age through comparison of substance use 

prevalence of 
8th, 10
th, and 
12th graders relative to 
each other
.  Often 
8th grade substance use is a 
bellwether, and year
-to-year changes that are 
unique to 
8th grade can signify an emerging 
increase or decrease in substance use at later ages 

with some time lag
.   Th
e analyses and associated tables that follow 
present substance
 use
 trends for all three grades 
separately, as well as trends in key attitudes, 
beliefs, 
and 
perceived availability
.  In a number of cases we 
provide insight into the age and cohort effects and 

secular trends that underlie trends in use and in key 

attitudes and beliefs.
 Be
ginning in
 2008, we
 have
 include
d a
n additional
 set of ta
bles 
to provide an overview of drug use 
trends for the three grades combined
 (Tables 1
Œ4).  This 
information 
gives a 
summary 
of 
the general 
nature of 
historical trends over the last several 

years
.  Also, for trends that are in the same direction 
and 
magnitude across all three grades,
 these
 combined analyses provide greater statistical power 

to detect trends that are statistically significant.
 Decl
ines Across a Broad Spectrum of 
Drugs 
in 2014
 De
clining use
 of a number of licit and illicit 
substances
 is 
a 
main finding in 
2014.  Annual 
prevalence of drug use declined for 
28 of 
the 34 
drug outcomes reported for the combined pool of 

8th, 10
th, and 12
th graders
, shown
 in 
Table 2
. 
Annua
l prevalence of using 
any illicit drug
 decreased slightly, but not significantly, in all three 

grades: by 0.6 (ns) percentage points in 8
th grade, 
2.1 (ns) percentage points in 10
th, and 1.5 (ns) 
percentage points in 12
th.  For the three grades 
combined prevalence declined by 1.4 (ns) 

percentage points.
 Th
is decrease
 in annual prevalence of using
 any 
illicit drug 
is due in large part to a decrease in 

annual prevalence of 
marijuana
, which declined by 

1.0 (ns), 2.5 (s), and 1.3 (ns) percentage points in 

8th, 10th, and 12
th grades respectively
.  For the three 
grades combined, annual prevalence of marijuana 

was 
down by 1.6 (s) percentage points.  
 Al
though use of marijuana declined in 2014, youth 
marijuana attitudes moved toward greater 

acceptance
.  Perceived 
risk
 of regular marijuana use 
declined in all three grades
, though not 
significantly
.  In 2014 t
he percentage
s 
of youth who 
believe regular marijuana use results in ﬁgreat 

harmﬂ physically or in other ways continued its 
 longer
-term
 decline
 by 
2.1 percentage points to 
58.9% (ns) for 8
th graders
,  1.1 percentage points to 
45.4% (ns) for 10
th graders, and 3.4 percentage 
points to 36.1% (ns) for 12
th graders
..  Disapproval
 of people who use marijuana regularly also 
declined in 8
th grade (from 83.8% to 82.2%) and 
12th grade (from 74.5% to 73.4%), but increased 
slightly in 10
th grade (from 73.8% to 74.6%)
Šall 
non-significant
.   Additional drugs with declining prevalence
 include: 
synthetic marijuana, bat
h 
salts, narcotics other 
than heroin 
(including the specific drugs 
Vicodin and OxyContin), ect
asy 
(MDMA), hallucinogens other than LSD, Salvia, over
-the-counter cough 
and cold medicines, 
amphetamine use without a 
doctor™s orders, 
Ritalin, Adderall, ‚crack™ cocaine, 
and any prescription psychotherapeutic drug. The 
psychotherapeutic drugs
 warrant special 
attention, given that they now make up a 

significantly larger part of the overall U.S
. drug 
problem than was true 10
Œ15 years ago
.  This is
 in 
part
 because use increased for many prescription 
drugs over that period, and in part because use of a 

number of street drugs has declined substantially 

since the mid
- 
to late
-1990s
.  It seems likely that 
young people are less concerned about the dangers 

of u
sing these prescription drugs outside of medical 
regimen because they are widely used for legitimate 

purposes
.  (Indeed, the low levels of perceived risk 
for sedatives and amphetamines observed among 

12th graders illustrate this point.) Also, prescript
ion 
psycho
therapeutic drugs are now being advertised 
directly to the consumer, which implies that they 

are both widely used and safe
 to use.  
Fortunately, 
the use of most of these drugs has either leveled or 

begun to decline in the past few years.  
The 

proportion of 12
th graders misusing 
any
 of these 
prescription drugs (i.e., amphetamines, sedatives, 

tranquilizers, or narcotics other than heroin) in the 

prior year declined 
significantly 
to 13.9% (ss) in 
2014, which is down from a high of 17.1% in 2
005.  Illic
it Drugs Holding Steady in 2014
 The use of a nu
mber of drugs 
showed litt
e or no 
change from 2013
 to 2014. These include 
inhalants, tranquilizers, the club drug GHB, LSD, cocaine, heroin
, methamphetamine
 and 
crystal 
methamphetamine
, sedatives
, rohypnol
, ketamine
, and 
anabolic steroids
. 
Tobac
co and Alcohol Use
 Tw
o main findings stand out 
for
 alcohol and 
tobacco 
in 2014
.  
First, 
cigarette
 smoking and 
alcohol use have 
continued 
their 
long declines 
and 
are now at t
he lowest levels recorded in the history 
of the survey.  Second, the new product of e
-cigarettes has made rapid inroads among 

adolescents
, 
and 
its 
prevalence is
 now higher 
than 
the prevalence 
of tobacco 
cigarette smoking.
 De
clines in Tobacco and Alcohol Use
 Th
irty
-day prevalence of cigarette use reached a 
peak in 1996 at grades 8 and 10, capping a rapid 

climb from the 1991 levels (when data were first 

gathered on these grades)
.  Between 1996 and 
2014, current smoking fell 
dramatically 
in these 
grades (by 
81% and 
77
%, respectively)
.  However, 
the decline in use decelerated in recent years, and in 

2010 there was a suggestion
 of some increase in 
smoking rates among 
8th and 10
th graders (though 
not statistically significant)
.  In 20
11 through 2014
, 
use declined
 further 
among 
8th and 10
th graders
 (the 
2014 decline
 was significant for 
10th graders)
.  For 
12th graders, peak use occurred in 1997 at 37%, and 
has shown a more modest decline since then, to 

14
% in 201
4 
(a 63% decline)
.  Because of the 
strong cohort effect that we have consistently 

observed for cigarette smoking, we 
have predicted 

use at 
12th grade to continue to show declines, as 
the lighter
-using cohorts of 
8th and 10
th graders 
become 
12th g
raders
; and, indeed, the largest (and 
significant) 
decline
 in 2014 was among the 12
th graders
.   Life
time
 prevalence of cigarette use also continues 
its long
-term d
ecline
.  It 
declined
 in 201
4 
in all 
three grades: to 1
4% in 
8th grade (
-1.3, ns), to 
23
% in 10
th grade (
-3
.1, s
s), and to 3
4% in 
12th grade (
-3.7, ss).  For the three grades combined, it was 
down 2.7
 percentage points (
sss).  The fact that 
fewer young people initiat
ed smoking is an 
important reason for the large declines in current 

use
.  The proportion of students who have 
ever 
tried
 cigarettes has fallen from peak levels reached 
 in 1996 or 1997 by 7
3%, 
63%, and 4
7% in the three 
grades, respectively
.   Overall inc
reases in perceived risk and disapproval 
appear to have contributed to the downturn
 in 
cigarette use
.  Perceived risk increased substantially 
and steadily in all grades from 1995 through 2004, 

after which it leveled in 
8th and 10
th grades
. However
, it continued rising in 
12th grade until 
2006, after which it leveled and then declined some 

in 2008.  Disapproval of smoking had been rising 

steadily in all grades since 1996
.  After 2004, the 
rise decelerated in the lower grades through 
2006Š
again, reflecting a cohort effect in this attitude
.  All 
three grades showed slight increases in perceived 

risk and 
disapproval in 2012
, a halting 
of perceived 
risk and disapproval
 in 2013, and 
 (though 
disapproval did rise further
 among 10
th graders in 
2014. 
It seems likely that some of the attitudinal change 
surrounding cigarettes is attributable to the adverse 

publicity suffered by the tobacco industry in the 

1990s, as well as a reduction in cigarette advertising 

and an increase in antismoking 
campaigns
 reaching 
youth
.   Various other attitudes toward smoking became 
more unfavorable during that interval
 as well, 
though some have since leveled off.  
For example, 
among 
8th graders, the proportions saying that they 
ﬁprefer to date people who don™t smokeﬂ rose from 

71% in 1996 to 81% by 2004, where it remain
ed through
 2014.  Similar changes occurred in 
10th and 
12th grades
.  Thus, at the present time, smoking is 
likel
y to make an adolescent less attractive to the 
great majority of potential romantic 
agemates
.  However, most of the negative connotations of 

smoking and smokers have leveled off in the past 

few years
.  In addition to changes in attitudes and 
beliefs about smoking, price likely also played an 
important role in the decline in use.  
Cigarette 

prices rose appreciably in the late 1990s and early 

2000s as cigarette companies tried to cover the 

costs of the 1998 Master S
ettlement
 Agreement
, and as many states increased excise taxes on 

cigarettes
.  A 
significant increase in the federal 
tobacco tax 
passed 
in 2009
 may have contributed to 
the continuation of the decline in use since then.
 Smokeless tobacco
.  From t
he mid
-1990s to the 
early 2000s
, 
smokeless tobacco use
 declined 
substantial
ly, but a rebound in use developed from 
the mid
-2000s through 2010.  Since 2010
, 
prevalence levels
 have dec
line
d modest
ly in all 
three grades
 and
 then 
remained steady in 2014
.  Perceived risk and disapproval appear to have 

played important roles in the earlier decline in 

smokeless tobacco use
.  In all three
 grades, 
perceived risk and disapproval rose fairly steadily 

from 1995 through 2004, 
accompanied by declines 

in use
.  However, there was not much change 
between 2004 and 2010,
 suggesting that other 
factors 
may have led to the increases in smokeless 
tobacco use during that time interval.  
These factors 

might include increased promotion of these 

products, a proliferation of types of smokeless 

tobacco products available, and increased 

restrictions on places where c
igarette smoking is 

permitted
.  The
 decline or leveling in smokeless 
tobacco 
use since 2010 may be attributable, at least 
in part, to 
the
 2009 increase in federal taxes on 
tobacco
.  Perceived risk did not significantly 
change from 2013 to 2014 at any grade level.
 Alcohol 
remains the 
subs
tance
 most widely used by 
today™s teenagers.  
Despite recent declin
es, two
 out 
of every t
hree
 students (6
6%) have consumed 
alcohol (more than just a few sips
 by the end of 
high school, and
 over
 a quarter
 (27
%) have done so 
by 
8th grade
.  In fact, half (5
0%) of 
12th graders and 
one in nine
 (11%) 8th graders in 201
4 
report
ed having been drunk at least once in their life.
 Alcohol use began
 a substantial decline in the 
1980s.  To 
so
me
 degree, alcohol trends have tended 
to parallel the trends in illicit drug use
.  These 
include a modest 
increase in binge drinking 
(defined as havin
g five or more drinks in a row 
at 
least once in the past two weeks) in the early 
to 
mid-1990s, though it 
was a proportionally smaller 
increase than was seen for cigarettes and most of 
the illicit drugs
.  Fortunately, 
binge drinking 
rates 
leveled off in 
the early 2000s,
 ju
st about when the 
illicit drug rates 
began to turn aroun
d, and in 2002
, 
a drop in drink
ing and drunkenness resumed in all 
grades.  Grad
ual declines continued into 
2014, which marked the lowest levels
 for drunkeness and 
alcohol use in
 all three grad
es ever recorded by the survey.    E-cigarettes
 E-cigarette use was assessed by MTF for t
he first 
time in 2014
.  
Questions on frequency of e
-cigarette 
use in the past 30
 days
 as well as perceived risk of 
e-
cigarettes were asked of 8
th, 10
th, and 12
th graders
. 
E-cigarettes now have the highest 
30-day 
prevalence
 of all tobacco products, including 
regular cigarettes, at all three grade levels
.  Prevalence of e
-cigarette use was 8.7%, 16.2%, and 
17.1% in 
8th, 10th, and 12
th grade
, respectively
.  The 
corresponding prevalence for regular cigarette use 
was 
4.0%, 7.2%, and 13.6%.  
Note that in 8
th and 
10th grades e
-cigarette prevalence is more than 
twice the prevalence of regular cigarettes
.  As 
cohort effects in both cigarette and e
-cigarette 
smoking work their way up the age spectrum, we 

are likely to see th
is difference widening at 12
th grade.
 Substantially fewer students associate ﬁgreat riskﬂ 
with using e
-cigarettes regularly as compared to 
smoking one or more packs of cigarettes per day
.  In 8
th, 10th, and 12
th grades
, 
the percentage of 
students who perceive ﬁgreat riskﬂ in using e
-cigarettes regularly is 14.5%, 14.1%, and 14.2%, 

respectively
.  The corresponding percentages for 
risk associated with smoking one or more packs of 

cigarettes a day is 62%, 72%, and 78%.  
E-

cigarettes have a lower 
perceived risk for regular 

use than any other drug in the survey, including 

alcohol
. 
  Any Illicit Drug
 MT
F routinely reports three different indexes of illicit 
drug use
Šany illicit drug, any illicit drug other than 
marijuana, and any illicit drug including inhalants.
6 In 
this section we discuss only the first two; the statistics 
for all three may be found in Tables 5
Œ7. In order to make comparisons over time, we have kept 

the definitions
 and measurement
 of these indexes 
constant
.  
Levels would be little affected by t
he 
inclusion of newer substances, primarily because most 

individuals using newer ones are also using the more 

prevalent drugs included in the indexes
.  The major 
exception has been inhalants, the use of which is quite 
prevalent in the lower grades, so in
 1991 a special 
index that includes inhalants was added.
 Trends in Use
 In the late 20th century, young Americans reached 
extraordinarily high levels of illicit drug use by U.S
.  as well as international standards
.  The trends in 
lifetime
 use of 
any
 illicit drug
 are 
shown
 in the first 
(upper left) 
panel on the facing page.
7 In 1975, when 
MTF began, the majority of young people (55%) had 

used an illicit drug by the time they left high school
.  This figure rose to two thirds (66%) in 1981 before a 

lon
g and gradual decline to 41% 
by 1992Šthe low 
point
.  After 1992
Šin what we have called the 
ﬁrelapse phaseﬂ in the epidemic
Š 
the proportion rose 
considerably
 to 
a recent high point of 55% in 1999; it 
then declined gradually to 47% in 2009, 
before rising 

slightly to 
49% in 2014
. 
Trends for 
annual, as opposed to lifetime, prevalence 
are shown
 in the second (upper right) panel
.  They are 
quite parallel to those for lifetime prevalence, but at a 

lower level
.  
Among 
8th graders, a gradual and 
continuing falloff occurred after 1996
.  
Peak rates 
since 1991 were reached in 1997 in the two upper 

grades and declined little for several years
.  
Between 
2001 and 2007 all three grades showed declines, but 

the annual use rates in all three grades 
were
 higher in 
2014. 6Footnote 
‚a™ 
to Tables 5 through 8 provides the exact definition of any illicit 
drug.
 7This is the only set of figures in this 
Overview
 presenting lifetime use statistics
.  Lifetime statistics
 for all drugs 
may be found in Table 5
.   Because marijuana is much more prevalent than any 

other illicit drug, trends in its use tend to drive the 

index of any illicit drug u
se
.  
Thus we also report an 
index that excludes marijuana and shows the 

proportions of students who use
 any of 
the other
 illicit 
drugs
.  The proportions who have used 
any illicit 
drug other than marijuana
 in their 
lifetime
s are 
shown in the third panel
 (lower left)
.  In 1975 over 
one third (36%) of 
12th graders had tried some illicit 
drug other than marijuana
.  This figure rose to 43% by 
1981, then declined for 
over a decade 
to a low of 25% 

in 1992.  
Some increase followed in the 1990s as the 

use of a number of drugs rose steadily, and it reached 
30% by 1997.  (In 2001 it was 31%, but this apparent 

upward shift in the estimate was an artifact due to a 
change in the question wording for ﬁother 
hallucinogensﬂ and tranquilizers.
8) Lifetime 
prevale
nce among 
12th graders then fell slightly
 to 
24% by 2009, 
 about 
where it remained in 201
4 
(2
3%)
.  
The fourth 
(lower  right) 
panel presents the 
annual prevalence data for any illicit drug other than 
marijuana, which shows a pattern of change over the 

past few years similar to the index of any illicit drug 

use, but with much less pronounced change since 

1991.  It 
dropped fairly steadily and
 gradually in all 
three grades in recent years
 but leveled in 2013
 and 
dropped non
-significantly among 12
th graders only in 
2014 (by 1.9 percentage points)
. 
Overall, these data reveal that, while use of individual 

drugs (other than marijuana) may fluctuate widely, the 

proportion using any of them is much more stable
.  In 
other words, the proportion of students prone to using 
such drugs and willing to cross the normative barriers 
to such use changes more gradually
.  The usage rate 
for each individual 
drug, on the other hand, reflects 

many more rapidly changing determinants specific to 

that drug: how widely its psychoactive potential is 
recognized, how favorable the reports of its supposed 
benefits are, how risky its use is seen to be, how 

acceptable it
 is in the peer group, how accessible it is, 
and so on.
 8The term psychedelics was re
placed with hallucinogens, and shrooms was 
added to the list of examples, resulting in somewhat more respondents 
indicating use of this class of drugs
.  For tranquilizers, Xanax was added to the 
list of examples given, slightly raising the reported preva
lence of use.

 Marijuana
Mari
juana has been the most widely used illicit drug 
throughout MTF™s 
40-year history
.  It can be taken 
orally, mixed with food, and smok
ed, including
 in a 
concentrated form as hashish
Šthe use of which is 
much more common in Europe
.  The great majority of 
recreational use 
in the U.S
. involves smoking it in 
rolled cigarettes (ﬁjointsﬂ), in pipes or water pipes
 (ﬁbongsﬂ)
, or in hollowed
-out cigars (ﬁbluntsﬂ).
 Trends in Use
 Annual marijuana 
prevalence peaked 
among 12
th graders in 1979 at 
51%, following a rise that began 
during 
the 1960
s.  
Then use declined fairly 
steadily 
for 
13 years, bottoming at 22% in 1992
Ša decline of 
more than 
half
.  
The 1990s, however, saw a 
resurgence 
of use.  
After a considerable increase (one 
that actually began among 
8th graders a year earlier 
than among 
10th and 12
th graders), annual prevalence 
rates peaked in 199
6 at 
8th grade 
and in 1997
 at 
10
th and 12
th grades
.  After these peak years, use declined 
among all three grades through 2006, 2007, or 2008; 
after the declines,
 an upturn 
occurred 
in use in all 
three grades, lasting for three years in the lower 

grades and 
longer 
in grade 
12
.  Annual mariju

Among 1

 and

(Only one of the 1
-year changes in 2013
 or 2014 wa
s significant.) As shown in Table 8, 
daily use increased in all three grades
 after 2007, reaching 
peak
s 
in 2011 (at 1.3
% in 8
th), 2013 (at 4.0% in 10
th), 
and 2011 (
at 
6.6% in
 12th), before declinin
g 
modestly 
since
.  Daily prevalence
 rates
 in 2014
 were
 1.0%,
 3.4%, and 
5.8%, respectively.  
 Perceived Risk
 The proportion of students seeing great risk from 
using marijuana regularly fell during the rise in use in 

the 1970s
 and again during the subsequent rise in the 
1990s.  
Indeed, 
for
 10th and 12
th grades, perceived risk 
declined a year before use rose in the upturn of the 

1990s, making perceived risk a leading indicator of
change in use
.  (The same may have happened 
for
 8
th grade as well, but we lack data starting early enough 

to know.) The d
ecline in perceived risk halted in 1996 
in 
8th and 
10th grades; the increases in use ended a 
year or two later, again making perceived risk a 

leading indicator of use
.  From 1996 to 2000, 
perceived risk held fairly steady
, 
and the decline in 
use in t
he upper grades stalled
.  After some decline 
prior to 2002, perceived risk increased a bit in all 
grades through 2004 as use decreased
.  Since 
2004 in 
8th  
grade, 
2005 in 
12th grade
, and 2008 in 10
th grade,
 perceived risk has fallen substantially,
 presaging the 
more recent resurgence in marijuana use; but no 
increase in perceived risk preceded
 either
 the
 recent
 leveling of use
 or the modest decline in use
 in
 2014
.  Rather, perceived risk has continued a steep decline 

since the mid
-2000s.
  
Disapproval
 Personal disapproval of trying marijuana fell 

considerably among 
8th graders between 1991 and 
1996 and among 
10th and 12
th graders between 1992 
and 1997
Šby 17, 21, and 19 percentage points, 
respectively, over those intervals of increasing use
.  
After that there was some modest increase in 

disapproval among 
8th graders, but not much among 
10th and 12
th graders until 2004, when the lower 
grades showed increases
.  From 2003 to 2007 (2008 
in the case of 
10th graders) disapproval increased in all 
three grades, but 
has 
declined some since then
, particularly in the lower grades.
 As is often the case, 
per
ceived risk fell before disapproval.
 Availability
 Si
nce the MTF study began in 1975, between 81% 
and 90% of 12
th graders each year have said that they 
could get marijuana fairly easily or very easily if they 
wanted some, with that figure standing 
at 81% in 
2014.  Marijuana has been considerably less readily 

available to 8
th graders, with 37% in 2014 
reporting it 
to be fairly or very easy to get (a significant decline 

from 2013)
.  Availability is intermediate for the 10
th graders, with 67% r
eporting easy access in 2014 (also 
a significant decline from 2013)
.  Thus, while 
availability has declined
 appreciably
, especially 
among the younger adolescents, marijuana remains 

readily available to 12
th graders.

 Synthetic Marijuana
Sy
nthetic marijuana
 has generally been sold over
 the
 counter under such labels as Spice and K
-2
.  
It usually 
contains some 
herbal 
materials that have been sprayed 
with one or more of the designer chemicals that fall 
into the cannibinoid family
.  Until March 
2011
, 
these 
drugs were not scheduled by the Drug Enforcement 
Administration
 (DEA)
, so they were readily and 
legally available on the 
Internet and in head shops, 
gas stations, etc
.  However, the DEA schedule
d some 
of 
the most widely used chemicals 
beginning March 
1, 2011, making the
ir possession and sale 
no longer 
legal
; subsequent law
s  
have 
expanded the list of 
banned chemicals.
 Trends in Use
 MTF first addressed the use of synthetic marijuana in 
its 2011 survey
 by 
asking 
12th graders about 
their 
use 
in the prior 12 mont
hs (
which would have covered a 
considerable period of time prior to the drugs being 

scheduled
).  Annual prevalence was found to be 
11.4%, making synthetic marijuana the second most 
widely used class of illicit drug after marijuana among 
12th graders
.  
Despite 
the DEA™s 
intervention, use 
among 12
th graders remained unchanged in 2012 at 
11.3%, which suggests either
 that
 compliance with the 
new scheduling ha
d 
been limited or that 
produce
rs
 of 
these products succeeded in
 continuing 
to change their chemical formulas to avoid using the 

ingredients
 that ha
d 
been scheduled
.  In 2012
, 
for the 
first time
, 8
th and 10
th graders were asked about their 
use of synthetic marijuana; annual prevalence rates 

were 4.4% and 8.8%
, respectively
.  Use in all 3 grades 
dropped in 2013, 
and 
the decline was 
sharp and 
significant among
 12th graders
.  The declines 
continued into 2014
 and were significant for both 10
th and 12
th graders
.   Perceived
 Risk
 All three grades were asked 
whether they associate
d 
great risk with trying synthetic marijuana
 once or 
twice
.9 As can be seen on the facing page, 
the
 level of 
perceived risk
 for experimental use
 was quite low 
(between 24% and 33%)
 but 
has been rising some 
among 12
th graders
.  Likely the availability of these 
drugs over the counter has had the effect of 

communicating to teens that they must be safe, though 

they are not.
  
9 No questions have been asked about personal disapproval or perceived 
availability of synthetic marijuana.

(no data) Inhalants
 In
halants are any gases or fumes that can be inhaled 
for the purpose of getting high.  
These include many 
household products
Šthe sale and possession of 
which is legal
Šincluding glue, nail pol
ish remover, 
gasoline, solvents, butane, and propellants used in 
certain commercial products such as whipped cream 

dispensers
.  Unlike nearly all other classes of drugs, 
their use is most common among younger adolescents 
and tends to decline as youth gro
w older
.  The use of 
inhalants at an early age may reflect the fact that 
many inhalants are cheap, readily available (often in 

the home), and legal to buy and possess
.  The decline 
in use with age likely reflects their coming to be seen 
as ﬁkids™ drugs
,ﬂ in addition to the fact that a number 
of other drugs become available to older adolescents, 
who are also more able to afford them.
 Trends in Use
 Inhalant use (excluding the use of nitrite inhalants) 
by 
12th graders 
rose gradually from 1976 to 1987, which 
was somewhat unusual 
because
 most other forms of 
illicit drug use were in decline during the 1980s
.  Use 
of inhalants 
rose among 
8th and 10
th graders from 
1991, when those grades
 were first  included in the 
stu
dy, through 1995
; it rose
  
among 12
th graders from 
1992 to 1995.  
All grades then exhibited a fairly 
steady and substantial decline in use through 2001 or 
2002.  After 2001 the grades diverged somewhat in 

their trends: 
8th graders showed a significant increase 
in use for two years, followed by a decline from 2004 
to 201
3, including a significant decline in annual use 
in 2013;
 10th graders showed an increase after 2002 
but 
a considerable 
decline since 2007; 
and 12
th graders showed 
a brief 
increas
e from 2003 to 2005 
but 
also 
a considerable 
decline since then
.  For the 
three grades combined, annual use declined 

significantly in both 2012 and 2013, but held steady in 

2014. Perceived Risk
 Only 
8th and 10
th graders have been asked questions 
about the degree of risk they associate with inhalant 
use
.  Relatively low proportions think that there is a 
ﬁgreat riskﬂ in using an inhalant once or twice
.  However, significant increases in this belief were 
observ
ed between 1995 and 1996 in both 
8th and 10
th grades, probably due to an anti
-inhalant advertising 
initiative launched by The Partnership for a Drug
-Free 
America
.  That increase in perceived risk marked the 
beginning of a long and import
ant decline in inhalant 
use, when 
 no other drugs showed a turnaround in use
.  However, the degree of risk associated with inhalant 

use declined steadily between 2001 and 2008 among 

both 
8th and 10
th graders, perhaps explaining the 
increase
 in use in 2003 among 
8th graders and in 2004 
in the upper grades
.  The hazards of inhalant use were 
communicated during the mid
-1990s
, 
but generational 
forgetting of those hazards has likely 
taken 
place as 
replacement cohorts who we
re too young to get that 

earlier message have entered adolescence
.  
The 
decline in perceived risk is worrisome, though the 
decline did halt as of 2008, and perceived risk has not 
changed much since then
.  In this case, the decline in 
perceived risk (be
tween 200
1 
and 2008) did not 
translate into a surge in use
, 
but it may leave future 
class cohorts at risk for a recurrence of inhalant use
.   Disapproval
 Over 80% of 
8th and 10
th grade 
students say that they 
would disapprove of even trying an 
inhalant
.  (The 
question was not asked of 12
th graders.) 
There was a 
very gradual upward drift in this attitude among 
8th and 10
th graders from 1995 through about 2001, with 
a gradual falloff since then
 in both grades, although 
the decrease appears to have halted.
 Availability
 Respondents have not been asked about the 
availability of inhalants, because we assume that these 
products 
are universally available to young people in 
these age ranges.

(no data) LSD
Fo
r some years, LSD was the most widely used drug 
within the larger class of hallucinogens
.  This is no 
longer true, due to sharp decreases in its use combined 
with an increasing use of psilocybin
.  (Statistics on 
overall hallucinogen use and on use of hallucinogens 

other than LSD are shown in the tables at the end of 

this report.)
 Trends in Use
 Annual prevalence of LSD use among 12
th graders 
has been below 10% since MTF began
.  Use declined 
so
me for the first 10 years among 12
th graders, likely 
continuing a decline that had begun before 1975.  
Use 
was fairly level in the latter half of the 1980s but, as 

was true for a number of other drugs, rose in all three 
grades between 1991 and 1996
.  Between 1996 and 
2006 or so, use declined in all three grades, with 
particularly sharp declines between 2001 and 2003
.  
Since then use has remained at historically low levels
.  Perceived Risk
 We think it likely that perceived risk for LSD use 
increas
ed during the early 1970s, before MTF began, 
as concerns grew about possible neurological and 
genetic effects (most of which were never 

scientifically confirmed) as well as ﬁbad tripsﬂ and 

ﬁflashbacks.ﬂ However, there was some decline in 
perceived risk in the late 1970s, after which it 
remained fairly level among 12
th graders through most 
of the 1980s
.  A substantial decline occurred in all 
grades in the early 1990s
 as use rose
.  Since about 
2000, perceived risk declined steadily and 
substantially am
ong 
8th graders until 2007, when it 
leveled; it declined considerably among 10
th graders 
before leveling around 2002,
 dropping through 2007
, 
and then leveling after that
.  Among 12
th graders
, 
perceived risk has 
held fairly steady since 2002
.  The
 decline in the lower grades suggests that younger 
teens are less knowledgeable about this drug™s effects 

than their predecessors
Šthrough what we have called 
ﬁgenerational forgettingﬂ
Šmaking them vulnerable 
to a resurgence in use
.  (The percentages who r
espond  
ﬁcan™t say, drug unfamiliarﬂ to questions about LSD 

have risen in recent years, consistent with the notion 

of  ﬁgenerational forgetting.ﬂ)
 The d
ecline of LSD use in recent years, despite a fall 
in perceived risk, suggests that some factors other 
than a change in underlying attitudes and beliefs were 
contributing to the downturn
Šprior to 2001 some 
displacement by ecstasy may have been a factor, 

while more recently a decline in availability 
(discussed below) likely is a factor.
 Disapproval
 Disapprova
l of LSD use was quite high among 12
th graders through most of the 1980s
 but began to 
decline after 1991 along with perceived risk
.  
All 
three grades exhibited a decline in disapproval 
through 1996, with disapproval of experimentation 

dropping 11 perc
entage points between 1991 and 
1996 among 12
th graders
.  
After 1996 a slight increase 
in disapproval emerged among 12
th graders, 
accompanied by a leveling among 10
th graders and 
some further decline among 
8th graders
.  Since 2001, 
disapproval of LSD use has diverged among the three 

grades, declining considerably among 
8th graders, 
declining less among 10
th graders, and increasing 
significantly among 12
th graders
.  Note, however, that 
the percentages of 
8th and 10
th graders who respond 
with ﬁcan™t say, drug unfamiliarﬂ increased 
 through 
2008; 
thus the base for disapproval has shrunk, 
suggesting that the real decline of disapproval among 

the younger students is less than it appears here
.  All 
three grades remained fairly level in 201
4. 
Availability
 Reported availability of LSD by 12
th graders fell 
considerably from 1975 to 1979, declined a bit further 

until 1986, and then began a substantial rise, reaching 
a peak in 1995.  
LSD availability also rose somewhat 
among 
8th and 10
th graders in the early 1990s, 
reaching a peak in 1995 or 1996.  
Since those peak 
years, there has been considerable falloff in 

availability in all three grades, including a significant 
decrease for
 8
th and 10
th graders in 2012, quite 
possibly in part because fewer students have LSD
-using friends from whom they could gain access
.  There was also very likely a decrease in supply due to 
the closing of a major LSD
-producing lab by the Drug 
Enforce
ment Administration in 2000
.  It is clear that 
attitudinal changes cannot explain the recent declines 

in use.

 Cocaine
Co
caine was used almost exclusively in powder form 
for some years, though ﬁfreebasingﬂ emerged for a 
while
.  The early 1980s brought the advent of crack 
cocaine
.  Our original questions did not distinguish 
among different forms of cocaine or modes of 
administration
.  Since 1987, though, we have asked 
separate questions about the 
use of crack and ﬁcocaine 

other than crack,ﬂ which has consisted almost entirely 

of powder cocaine use
.  Data on overall cocaine use 
are presented in the figures in this section, and results 

for crack alone are presented in the next section.
 Trends in Us
e 
There have been some important changes in the levels 
of overall cocaine use over the life of MTF
.  Use 
among 12
th graders originally burgeoned in the late 
1970s and remained fairly stable through the first half 

of the 1980s before starting a precipit
ous decline after 
1986.  Annual prevalence among 12
th graders dropped 
by about three quarters between 1986 and 1992
.  Between 1992 and 1999, use reversed course again 
during the relapse phase of the overall drug epidemic 
and doubled before declining by 2000.  
Use also rose 

among 
8th and 10
th graders after 1992 before reaching 
peak levels in 1998 and 1999
.  
Over the last 
fifteen 
years
, use 
has 
declined in all three grades; 
annual 12
th-grade use stands at a
 historical low of just 2.6% in 
2014, with use by 
8th and 10
th graders still lower.
 Perceived Risk
 Questions about the dangers of cocaine in general 
(without specifying any particular form of cocaine) 
have been asked only of 12
th graders
.  The results tell 
a fascinating story
.  The
y show that perceived risk for 
experimental use fell in the latter half of the 1970s 
(when use was rising), stayed level in the first half of 

the 1980s (when use was level), and then jumped very 
sharply in a single year (by 14 percentage points 
between 198
6 and 1987), just when the substantial 
decline in use began
.  
The year 1986 was marked by a 
national media frenzy over crack cocaine and also by 

the widely publicized cocaine
-related death of Len 
Bias, a National Basketball Association first
-round
 draft 
pick
.  Bias™ death was originally reported as 
resulting from his first experience with cocaine
.  
Though that was later proven to be incorrect, the 

message had already ﬁtaken.ﬂ We believe that this 
event helped to persuade many young people that use 
of 
cocaine at any level is dangerous, no matter how 
healthy the individual.
10 Perceived risk continued to 
rise through 1991 as the fall in use continued
.  Perceived risk declined modestly from 1991 to 2000, 
and use rose from 1992
Œ2000.  Perceived risk ha
s leveled in recent years at far higher levels than existed 
prior to 1987, and there has been a gradual upward 

drift over the past five years in 
all 
grades
.  There is as 
yet little evidence of generational forgetting of 
cocaine™s risks
.  For 12
th graders, 
survey questions on 
both risk and disapproval referred to cocaine in 
gen
eral, until 19
86.  After that they referred to cocaine 
powder
 and crack separately
, as did the questions 
asked of 
8th and 10
th graders
.  The question change 
seemed to 
matter rather little in the results.
 Disapproval
 Disapproval  of cocaine use by 12
th graders followed a 
cross
-time pattern similar to that for perceived risk, 
although its seven
-percentage
-point jump in 1987 was 
not quite as pronounced
.  Some decline from 1991 to 
1997 was
 followed by a period of stability
.  Recent 
years 
show
 a gradual 
increase
 in disapproval in all 
three grades
.  In 2014 the upwards drift halted in
 grades
 8 and 10
 and reversed significantly for cocaine 
and other cocaine among 12
th graders.
 Availability
 The proportion of 12
th graders saying that it would be 
ﬁfairly easyﬂ or ﬁvery easyﬂ for them to get cocaine if 

they wanted some was 33% in 1977, rose to 48% by 

1980 as use rose, and held fairly level through 1982; it 
increased steadily to 59% by 1989 (in a period of 

rapidly declining use)
.  Perceived availability then fell 
back to about 47% by 1994.  Since around 1997, 

perceived availability of cocaine has fal
len 
considerably in all three grades
.  Among 12
th graders 
it stood at 
29% in 
2014Š
about half of its peak level 
in 1989
.  
Note that the pattern of change does not map 

well onto the pattern of actual use, suggesting that 

changes in overall availability
 have not been a major 
determinant of use
Šparticularly during the sharp 
decline in use in the late 1980s
. 
10Trends in perceived 
 risk
 in Table 11 show a particularly sharp rise from 34% 
in 1986 to 48% in 1987 for trying cocaine once or twice.

 Crack
 Several indirect indicators suggest that crack use 
grew 
rapidly in the period 1983
Œ1986, beginning before we 
had direct measures of its use
.  In 1986 a single usage 
question was included in one of the five 12th
-grade 
questionnaire forms, asking those who indicated any 

cocaine use in the prior 12 months if 
they had used 

crack
.  The results from that question represent the 
first data point in the first panel on the facing page
.  
After that, three questions about crack use covering 
the
 usual three prevalence periods
 were introduced 
into several questionnaire f
orms
. 
Trends in Use
 Clearly crack use rose rapidly in the early 1980s, 
judging by the 4% prevalence reached in 1986
 but 
after 1986 
there was a precipitous drop in crack 
use among 12th 
graders; the
 drop continued through 1991.  After 1991 for 
8th an
d 10
th graders (when data 
were first available) and after 1993 for 
12th graders, all 
three grades showed a slow, steady 
increase in 
use through 1998
 during the relapse 
phase of the 
overall drug epidemic
.  
Since 1999, annual prevalence 
dropped by 
about 70% in 8
th grade, 80% in 10
th grade, and 60% in 12
th grade.  Today use of crack is near 
historic lows
 for 8
th and 12th graders and at its lowest 
point among 10
th graders.  
As with many drugs, the 
decline at 12
th grade lagged 
behind those in the lower 
grades due to 
a cohort effect. Perceived
 Risk
 By the time we added questions about the perceived 
risk of using crack in 1987, crack was already seen by 
12th graders as one of the most dangerous illicit drugs: 
57% saw
 a great risk in even trying it
.  
This compared 
to 54% for heroin, for example.  
Perceived risk for 
crack rose still higher through 1990, reaching 64% of 

12th grad
ers who said they thought there was a great 
risk in taking crack once or twice
.  (Use was dropping 
during that interval.) After 1990 some falloff in 

perceived risk began, well before crack use began to 

increase in 1994
.  
Thus, here again, perceived risk 
was a leading indicator
.  Between 1991 and 1998 
there was a considerable falloff in this belief in grades 

8 and 10, as use rose 
steadily
.  Perceived risk leveled 
in 2000 in grades 8 and 12 and a year later in grade 

10.We think that the declines in pe
rceived risk for
crack and cocaine during the 1990s may well reflect 
an example of generational forgetting wherein the 
class cohorts that were in adolescence when the 
adverse consequences were most obvious (i.e., in 
the mid-1980s) were replaced by 
cohorts who were 
less knowledgeable about the dangers.
  
In 2014 
perceived risk of trying crack rose 
slightly among 8th and 10
th graders but 
leveled among 12
th graders.  Perceived risk of regular use of crack dropped 
significantly in 
Di
sapproval
 Disapproval of crack use was not 
assessed
 until 1990,
 when
 it was at a 
high level, with 92% of 12
th graders 
saying that they disapproved of even trying it
.  Disapproval of crack use declined slightly but steadily 
in all three grades from 1991 through about 1997
.  Since 1997, disapproval has increased slightly in all 

thre
e grades
. 
In 2014 disapproval of crack use seems 
to have leveled in the 
lower
 grades while it dropped 
for the 
second 
year in a row among
 12th graders.
 Availability
 Crack availability did not change dramatically in the 

early years 
for which data are availab
le
.  It began a 
sustained decline after 1995 
among
 8
th graders, after 
1999 among 10
th graders
, 
and after
 2000 among 12
th graders
.  Since 200
0, availability has declined
 considerably
, particularly in the upper 
grades
, 
and 
there were
 further
 significant declines in all three 
grades in 2014.
 NOTE: The distinction between crack cocaine and 
other forms of cocaine (mostly powder) was made 
several years after the study™s inception
.  
The figures 
on the facing page begin their trend lines when these 
distinctions were introduced for the different types of 
measures
.  Figures are not presented here for the 
ﬁother forms of cocaineﬂ measures, simply because 
the trend curves look extremely similar to those 
for 
crack
.  (All statistics are contained in the tables 
presented later.) Although the trends are very similar, 
the absolute levels of use, risk, etc., are somewhat 
different
.  Usage levels tend to be higher for cocaine 
powder compared to crack, and the le
vels of 
perceived risk a bit lower, while disapproval has been 
close for the two different forms of cocaine and 
relative availability has varied (Tables 15 through 17)

 Amphetamines
Am
phetamines, a class of psychotherapeutic st
im-ulants, had a relatively high prevalence of use in the 
youth population for many years.  
The behavior 

reported here excludes any use under medical 
supervision
.  Amphetamines are controlled sub
-stances
Šthey are not legally
 bought or sold without a 
doctor
™s prescription
Šbut some are diverted from 
legitimate channels, and some are manufactured 
and/or imported illegally.
 Trends in Use
 The use of amphetamines rose in the last half of the 
1970s, reaching a peak of 26% in 1981
 (
likely
 exaggerated due to commonly used ﬁlook
-alikesﬂ)
Štwo years after marijuana use peaked
.  From
 1981 
to 
1992, 12
th graders reported
 a steady and substantial 
decline in
  
use of amphetamines.
 As with
 many other illicit drugs, amphetamines made 
a comeback in 
the 1990s
.  
Use peaked in th
e lower 
two g
rades by 1996.  
Since then, use declined steadily 
in 8
th grade and sporadically in 10
th grade.  
Only after 
2002 did it begin to decline in 12
th grade.  
The decline 
paused in 2008
 for 8
th graders and
 20
09/2010 for 12
th graders, and then resumed
. The 12th-grade decline 
began in
 2003 but reversed from 20
09 to 2013
.  
In 2013 the amphetamines 
prevalence question text was 
changed in half
 of the questionnaire forms.  
Last year™s report 
presented the 2013 data for the 
unchanged forms only.  
This year™s rep
ort uses 2013 
data from the changed forms only, 
to be comparable 
to th
e 2014 measure.  In 2
014 the remainin
g forms 
were changed; the 2014 data presen
ted here are for all 
the forms
.  
There was little change in annual 
amphetamine use between 2
013 and 2014 for the 
lower grades, though 12th grade use decreaed some. Perceived Risk
 Only 12
th graders are asked about the amount of risk 
they associate with amphetamine use
.  For a few 

years, changes in perceived risk were not correlated 

with changes in usage levels (at the aggregate level)
.  Specifically, in the interval 1981
Œ1986, risk was quite 
stable even though use fell considerably, likely as a 

result of some displacem
ent by cocaine
.  There was, 
however, a decrease in risk during the period 1975
Œ
1981 (when use was rising), some increase in 
perceived 
risk in 1986
Œ199
1 (when use was 
falling), 
and some decline in perceived
 risk from 1991 to 1995 
(in advance of use rising a
gain)
.  
Perceived risk has 
generally been 
rising in recent years, very likely 
contributing to the decline in use that
 occurr
ed among
 12th graders after 2002; it appears to 
have leveled 
since 2007
.  In 2011 the examples of specific 
amphetamines provided in 
the text of the questions on 
perceived risk, disapproval, and availability were 
updated with the inclusion of Adderall and Ritalin
.  This led 
to some 
discontinuities in the trend lines in 
2011.  
(L
evels of perceived risk and disapproval
 lowered as a result
.) Based on the revised question, 
little change hasoccurred since 2011.   Disapproval
 Disapproval of amphetamine use is asked in 12
th grade only.  Relatively high proportions of 12
th graders have disapproved of even trying 
amphetamines throughout the life 
of the study
.  Disapproval did not change in the late 1970s despite 
an increase in use
.  From 1981 to 1992, disapproval 
rose gradually and substantially 
from 71% to 87% as 
perceived risk rose and use 
declined
.  In the mid
-1990s disapproval
 decline
d along with perceived risk, 
but it increased fairly steadily from 1996 through 

2009 before leveling.  
 Availability
 In 1975, amphetamines had a high level of reported 
availability
.  
The level fell
 by about 10 
percentage 
points by 1977, drifted up a bit through 1980, jumped 

sharply in 1981, and then began a long, gradual 
decline through 1991.  
There was a modest increase in 

availability at all three grade levels in the early 1990s 

as use rose, followed by a long
-term decline after that
.  Some further decline occurred in all grades through 
2013, taking into account the rise in 2011 caused by 
the change in question wording.  
(See Table 6 for the 
trends in 
annual 
use of two 
specific
 amphetamines
ŠRitalin and Adderall)
.  
Since it was first measured in 
2001, Ritalin
 use has declined by 60% to 70% in all 
three grades
.  Adderall
 use 
declined 
in the lower 
grades since
 it was first measured in 2009; but 
annual 
prevalence increased significantly 
in 12
th grade

 Methamphetamine and Crystal Methamphetamine (Ice)
 On
e subclass of amphetamines is called meth
-amphetamine (ﬁspeedﬂ)
.  
This subclass has been 
around for a long time and gave rise to the phrase 
ﬁspeed killsﬂ in the 1960s
.  Probably because of the 
reputation it got at that time as a particularly 

dangerous drug, it was not popular for some years, s
o 
we did not include a full set of questions about its use 

in MTF™s early questionnaires
.  One form of metham
-phetamine, crystal methamphetamine or ﬁice,ﬂ grew 
in popularity in the 1980s
.  It comes in crystallized 
form, as the name implies, and the chu
nks can be 
heated and the fumes inhaled, much like crack.
 Trends in Use
 For most of the life of the study, the only question 
about 
methamphetamine
 use has been contained in a 
single 12
th-grade questionnaire form
.  Respondents 
who indicated using any 
type of amphetamines in the 
prior 12 months were asked in a sequel question to 

indicate on a prespecified list the types they had used 

during that period.  
Methamphetamine was one type 
on the list, and data exist on its use since 1976
.  (The 
rates are 
not graphed here until 1990.) In 1976, annual 
prevalence on this measure was 1.9%; it then roughly 

doubled to 3.7% by 1981 (the peak year), before 

declining for over a decade all the way down to 0.4% 
by 1992.  Use then rose again in the 1990s, as did use
 of a number of drugs, reaching 1.3% by 1998.  
In other words, it has followed a cross
-time trajectory 
fairly similar to that for amphetamines as a whole.
 In 1990, i
n the 12
th-grade questionnaires only, we 
introduced our usual set of three questions f
or crystal 
methamphetamine
, measuring lifetime, annual, and 
30-day use.  Among 12
th graders in 1990, 1.3% 
indicated any use in the prior year; use then climbed 
to 3.0% by 1998, and has generally been declining 
since
 and in recent years appears to have 
levelled at 
about 1%
.  This variable is charted on the first facing 

panel.
 Res
ponding to the growing concern about meth
-amphetamine use in general
Šnot just crystal 
methamphetamine use
Šwe added a full set of three 
questions about the use of any methamphetamine to 
the 1999 questionnaires for all three grade levels
.  These questions yield a somewhat higher annual 

prevalence for 12
th graders: 4.3% in 2000, compared 
to the sum of the methamphetamine and crystal 
methamphetamine answers in the other, branch
ing 
question format, which totaled 2.8%.  
It would appear, 
then, that the long
-term method we had been using for 
tracking methamphetamine use probably yielded an 

understatement of the absolute prevalence level, 
perhaps because some proportion of metham
-phetamine users did not correctly categorize 
themselves initially as amphetamine users (even 
though methamphetamine was given as one of the 

examples of amphetamines)
.  We think it likely that 
the shape of the trend curve was not distorted, 

however.
 The n
ewer questions for 
methamphetamine
 (not 
graphed here) show annual prevalence rates in 
2014 
of 
0.6% for 8
th graders,
 0.8
% 
for
 10th graders
, 
and 
1.0% for 12
th graders
.  
All of these levels are down 
considerably from the first measurement taken in 

1999, when they were 3.2%, 4.6%, and 4.7% (see 

Table 6)
.  So, despite growing public concern about 
the methamphetamine problem in the United States, 
use actually has shown a fairly steady decline
 since 
2000, at least among secondary school students
.  (A similar decline in methamphetamine use did not begin 
to appear among college students and young adults 

until after 2004, likely reflecting a cohort effect
.  See 
Volume II
 in this series.
) 
Other Measures
 No questions have yet been added to the study on 
perceived risk, disapproval, or availability with regard 

to overall methamphetamine use
.  Data on perceived 
risk and availability for crystal methamphetamine, 
specifically, may be found on the facing page.
 Cl
early the perceived risk of
 crystal methamphet
-amine use has risen considerably since 2003, very 
likely explaining much of the decline in use since 
then
.  Its perceived availability 
generally 
has been 
falling in all three grades since 2006, perhaps in part 

because there are many 
fewer users.

 Heroin
For many decades, heroin
Ša derivative of opium
Šwas administered primarily by injection into a vein
.  However, in the 1990s the purity of available heroin 
reached very high levels, making othe
r modes of 
administration (
e.g., snorting
, 
smoking) practical 
alternatives
.  Thus, in 1995 we introduced questions 
that asked separately about using heroin with and 
without a needle to determine whether noninjection 

use explained the upsurge in heroin us
e we were 
observing
.  The usage statistics presented on the 
facing page are based on heroin use by any method, 

but data on the two specific types of administration 

are 
provided 
in the tables at the end of this report.
  Trends in Use
 The annual prevalence
 of heroin use among 12
th graders fell by half between 1975 and 1979, from 
1.0% to 0.5%.  
The rate then held amazingly steady 

until 1994.  
Use rose in the mid
- 
and late
-1990s, along 
with the use of most drugs; it reached peak levels in 
1996 among 8
th graders (1.6%), in 1997 among 10
th graders (1.4%), and in 2000 among 12
th graders 
(1.5%), suggesting a cohort effect.  
Since those peak 
levels, use has declined, with annual prevalence in all 

three grades fluctuating between 0.7% and 0.9% from 
2005 through 201
0.  Use declined some in the 
next 
two years; in the three grades combined, the 2011 to 
2012 decline from 0.7% to 0.6% was significant
 but 
leveled in 2013
 with no further change in 2014
. 
 Because the questions about use with and without a 
needle were not introduced until the 1995 survey, they 
did not encompass much of the period of increasing 

heroin use
.  Responses to the new questions showed 
that
, 
by then
, 
about equal proportions of all 8
th-grade 
users were taking heroin by each method 
of ingestion, 

and some
Šnearly a third of users
Šwere using both 
means
.  
At 10
th grade
, 
a somewhat higher proportion 
of all users took heroin without a needle, and at 12
th grade
, 
the proportion was higher
 still
.  Much of the 
increase in overall 
heroin use beyond 1995 occurred 
in the proportions using it without injecting, which we 

strongly suspect was true in the immediately 

preceding period of increase as well
.  Likewise, most 
of the decrease since the recent peak levels has been 
due to decrea
sing use of heroin without a needle
.  
In 
2012 there were significant decreases in use of heroin 
without a needle for 8
th and 12
th graders
, but no 
further change in 2013
 or 2014.  All grades were at 
0.2%Œ
0.5% annual prevalence in 2012
 through 2014
. 
 
Use with a needle has fluctuated less over time, 
though in 2010
 twelf
th graders showed a significant 
increase to 0.7%, about where it remained in 2011 
(0.6%).  In 
2014 
all three grades were at 0.4%
 or 0.5%  using with a needle, and ther
e has been little 
change 
since 
2011.
  Perceived Risk
 Students have long seen heroin to be one of the most 
dangerous drugs, which helps to account for both the 

consistently high level of personal disapproval of use 
(see below) and the quite low prevalence 
of use
.  Nevertheless, perceived risk levels 
have changed 
some 
over the years
.  Between 1975 and 1986, 
perceived risk gradually declined, even though use 

dropped and then stabilized in that interval
.  Then 
there was a big spike in 1987 (
when
 perceive
d risk for 
cocaine
 also
 jumped dramatically), where it held for 
four years
.  In 1992, perceived risk dropped to a lower 
plateau again, presaging an increase in use a year or 

two later
.  Perceived risk rose in the latter half of the 
1990s, and use leveled off and 
then
 declined
.  Perceived risk of use without a needle rose in 
8th and 
10th grades
 between 1995 and 1997, foretelling an end 
to the increase in use
.  Note that perceived risk has 

served as a leading indicator of use for this drug as 

well
 as a number of others
.  During the 2000s, 
perceived risk has been relatively stable
. 

 Disapproval
 There has been little fluctuation in the very high levels 
of disapproval of heroin use over the years,
 though it 
rose gradually between 2000 and 2010.  
The small 
changes that have occurred have been generally 

consistent with changes in perceived risk and use
. 
 
Availability
 The proportion of 12
th-grade students saying they 
could get heroin fairly easily if they wanted some 

remained aroun
d 20% through the mid
-1980s.   I
t then 
increased considerably from 1986 to 1992 before 

stabilizing at about 35% from 1992 through 1998

- 
to late

 Other Narcotic Drugs, Including OxyContin and Vicodin
  There are a number of narcotic drugs other than 

heroin
Šall controlled substances
.  Many are 
analgesics that can be prescribed by physicians 
and 

dentists for pain
.  Like heroin, many are derived from 
opium, but there are also a number of synthetic 

analogues in use today, with OxyContin and Vicodin 

being two of the major ones.
  
Throughout the life of the MTF study, we have asked 
about the use 
of any narcotic drug other than heroin 
without specifying which one.  Examples of drugs in 
the class are provided in the question stem
.  In one of 
the six 12
th-grade questionnaire forms, however, 
respondents indicating that they had used any narcotic
 in the past 12 months were then asked to check which 

of a fairly long list of such drugs they used
.  Table E
-4 in 
Volume I
 of this annual monograph series provides 
trends in their annual prevalence data
.  In the late 

1970s, opium and codeine were amon
g the narcotics 

most widely used
.  In recent years Vicodin, codeine, 
Percocet, OxyContin
, 
and hydrocodone 
have been the 
most prevalent.
  
Trends in Use
 Use is reported only for 12
th graders, because we 
considered the data from 8
th and 10
th graders to be of 
questionable validity
.  As shown in the first panel of 
the facing page, 12
th graders™ use of narcotics other 
than heroin generally trended down from about 1977 
through 1992, dropping considerably.  
After 1992 use 
rose rather steeply
 as all forms of substance use were 
increasing, with annual prevalence nearly tripling 
from 3.3% in 1992 to 9.5% in 2004, before leveling
 through about 2009
.  Since then, use has been 
declining
, including a significant drop in use in 2014
.  (In 2002 the question was revised to add Vicodin, 

OxyContin, and Percocet to the examples given, 

which clearly had the effect of increasing reported 

prevalence, as may be seen in the first panel on the 

facing page
.  So the extent of the increase over the full 
time 
span likely is exaggerated, but probably not by 
much, because these drugs came onto the scene later, 
during the rise
.  They simply were not being fully 
reported until the late 1990s.)
  
Use rates for two narcotics of recent interest
ŠOxyContin and Vicodin
Šare presented in the second 
and third panels on the facing page, in a departure 

from the usual arrangement.  
There are no data to 
display for disapproval of use of narcotics other than 

heroin, and only limited data on perceived risk
 (since 
2010).  OxyC
ontin
 use increased some in all grades 
from 2002 (when it was first measured) through 

roughly 2009
, though the trend lines have been 

irregular
.  Since 2009 or 2010 
the prevalence rate 
has 
dropped in the upper 
grades
, though only 12
th grade 
showed any further decline in 2013.  
There was a 

significant drop in use among the 8
th graders in 2014
.  Annual prevalence in 
201
4 
was 
1.0%, 3.0%, and 
3.3% in grades 8, 10, and 12, respectively
.  Use of 
Vicodin
, on the other hand, remained fairly steady at 
somewhat higher levels since 2002, until its use 
declined after 2009
 in all three grades
.  In 
2014 
annual 
prevalence rates
 continued to decline and 
 were 1.
0%, 
3.4%, and 
4.8% in grades 8, 10, and 12
, respectively.
 Availability
 Questions 
were asked about the availability of 
narcotics other than heroin, taken as a class
.  Perceived availability increased gradually among 12
th graders from 1978 through 1989, even as reported use 
was dropping.  
Perceived availability then rose 

further, from 1991 through 2001, as use rose quite 
sharply before leveling by about 2000 and then 
declining after 2006
.  In contrast, perceived 
availability has declined among 8
th and 10
th graders 
since the late 1990s
.  
(In all three grades a
 change in 
quest
ion wording in 2010 to include OxyContin and 
Vicodin as examples presumably accounts for the 

considerable jump in reported availability that year.) 

Availability 
has 
declined further in all three grades 
since 2010.  
The 2014 declines amo
ng 10
th and 12
th graders were significant.

 Tranquilizers
 Tranquilizers are psychotherapeutic drugs that are 
legally sold only by prescription
.  They are central 
nervous depressants and, for the most part, comprise 
benzodiazepines 
(minor tranquilizers), although some 
nonbenzodiazepines have been introduced
.  
Respondents are instructed to exclude any medically 

prescribed use from their answers
.  At present, 
Xanax
 is the tranquilizer most commonly used by 12
th graders (only 12
th graders are asked to indicate which 
specific tranquilizers they used)
.  (See Table E
-3 in 
appendix E of 
Volume I
 in this series for details.) 
Valium, Klonopin, and Soma are other tranquilizers,
 used at somewhat lower levels
.  In 2001 the 
examples 
given in the tranquilizer question were modified to 
reflect changes in the drugs in common use
ŠMiltown was dropped and Xanax was added.  
As the 

first panel on the facing page shows, this caused a 

modest increase in the reported level of tranquil
izer 
use in the upper grades, so we have broken the trend 

line to reflect the point of redefinition.
 Trends in Use
 During the late 1970s and all of the 1980s, 
tranquilizers fell steadily
 and substantially
 from 
popularity, with 12
th graders™ use declining
 by three 
fourths over the 15
-year interval between 1977 and 
1992.  Their use then increased, as happened with 

many other drugs during the 1990s.  
Annual 

prevalence more than doubled among 12
th graders, 
rising steadily through 2002, before leveling.  
Use 

also rose steadily among 10
th graders, but began to 
decline some in 2002
.  Use peaked much earlier 
among 8
th graders
 in 1996
 and then declined slightly 
for two years
.  Tranquilizer use remained relatively 
stable among 8
th graders
 through
 2010 at considerably 
lower levels than the upper two grades
. 
They 
show
ed a significant decline in 2011
 and 
a modest further 
decline in 2012
 befo
re stabilizing once again
.  From 
2002 to 2005
, 
there was some decline among 10
th graders, followed by a leveling
, 
then a resumption of

. Among 12
th graders there was a 
very gradual decline from 2002 through 2007, before 

leveling and then decreasing in 2010 and 
again in 
2013.  This staggered pattern of change suggests that 
a cohort effect has been at work
.  In 2014
 the 
prevalence of use of these prescription
-type drugs 
was
 somewhat 
lower than their recent peak levels, with 
annual prevalence rates of 1.

%, and 
4.7% in

.   Perceived Risk and Disapproval
 Data have not been collected on perceived risk and 

disapproval primarily due to questionnaire space 

limitations.

 Sedatives (Barbiturates)
Li
ke 
tranquilizers, sedatives are prescription
-controlled psychotherapeutic drugs that act as central 
nervous system depressants
.  They are used to assist 
sleep and relieve anxiety.
 Though for many years respondents have been asked 

specifically about their use of barbiturate sedatives, 
they likely have been including other classes of 
sedatives in their answers
.  In 2004 the question on 
use was revised to say ﬁsedatives/barbituratesﬂ
Ša change that appeared to have no impact on reported 

levels of use
.  Res
pondents are told for what purposes 
sedatives are prescribed and are instructed to exclude 

from their answers any use under medical 

supervision
.  
Usage data are reported only for 12
th graders because we believe that 8
th- 
and 10
th-grade 
students tend to overreport use, perhaps including in 
their answers their use of nonprescription sleep aids or 
other over
-the
-counter drugs.
 Trends in Use
 As with tranquilizers, the use of sedatives (bar
-biturates) fell steadily among 12
th graders from the 
mid
-1970s
 through the early 1990s.  From 1975 to 
1992 annual prevalence fell by three fourths, from 
10.7% to 2.8%.  As with many other drugs, a gradual, 

long
-term resurgence in sedative use occurred after 
1992, but unlike the case with most illegal drugs, 
sedat
ive (barbiturate) use continued to rise steadily 
through 2005, well beyond the point at which the use 
of most illegal drugs began falling
.  (Recall that 
tranquilizer use also continued to rise into the early 

2000s.) Use has declined some since 2005, and 
by 
2014 
the annual prevalence rate was down by about 
four tenths
 from its recent peak
.  The sedative 
methaqualone has been included in the MTF study 
from the very beginning, and has never been as 

popular as barbiturates; use rates have generally
 been 
declining since 1975, reaching an annual prevalence 

of just 0.5% in 2007, about where it remained
 through 
2012, after which the question was dropped.
 Perceived Risk
 Trying sedatives (barbiturates) was never seen by 
most students as very dangerous; and it is clear from 
the second panel on the facing page that changes in 

perceived risk cannot explain the trends in use that 

occurred from 1975 through 1986, when perceived 

risk was actually declining along with use
.  But then 
perceived risk shifted up so
me through 1991 while 
use was still falling
.  It dropped back some through 
1995, as use was increasing, and then remained 

relatively stable for a few years
.  
Perceived risk has 
generally been at quite low levels, which may help to 

explain why the use o
f this class of psychotherapeutic 

drugs (and likely others) stayed at relatively high 

levels in the first half of the decade of the 2000s
.  However, perceived risk began to rise a bit after 2000, 
foretelling the decline in use that began after 2005
.  When the term ﬁsedativesﬂ was changed to 
ﬁsedatives/barbituratesﬂ in 2004, the trend line shifted 
down slightly, but perceived risk has continued to 

climb some since then
.  As perceived risk rose, use 
declined through 2011.
 Disapproval
 Like many illicit drugs other than marijuana, sedative 

(barbiturate) use has received the disapproval of most 

high school seniors since 1975, with some variation in 

disapproval rates that have moved consistently with 
usage patterns
.  
The necessary change in question 
wordin
g in 2004 appeared to lessen disapproval 
slightly
.  There has been 
a 
modest increase in 
disapproval since 2000
, 
although that appears to have 
stopped in 2014
. 
Availability
 As the fourth panel on the facing page shows, the 
perceived availability of sedatives (barbiturates) has 
generally been declining during most of the life of the 

study, ex
cept for one upward shift that occurred in 
1981Ša year in which look
-alike drugs became more 
widespread
.  
(The necessary change in question text 
in 2004 appears
 to have had the effect 
of increasing 
reported availability among 12
th graders but not 
among students in the lower grades.) Perceived 
availability for sedatives (barbiturates) continued 

its longterm decline in 2014.  Sedatives (Barbiturates): Trends in Annual Use, Risk, Disapproval, and AvailabilityGrades 8, 10, 12Source.

 Ecstasy (MDMA) 
and Other ﬁClub Drugsﬂ
 ﬁC
lub drugs,ﬂ so 
called
 because they have been 
popular at night clubs and raves
, 
include LSD, 
MDMA (ecstasy), methamphetamine, GHB 
(gammahydroxybutyrate), ketamine (special K), and 
Rohypnol
.  (For discussion of 
LSD and meth
-amphetamine, 
see prior pages in this 
Overview
.) Rohypnol
 and 
GHB
 are
 labeled date rape drugs 
because they can have amnesiac effects and be added 

to food or drink without 
a 
victim's knowledge
.  By 
2011, both drugs had shown significant
 declines since 
their peak levels of 
annual 
use (Table 6).  
In 2011, 
annual prevalence for Rohypnol use was 0.8%, 0.6%, 
and 1.3%, and for GHB use, 0.6%, 0.5%, and 1.4% in 
grades 8, 10, and 12, respectively.  Annual prevalence 
for another club drug, 
ketamin
e, had 
also 
shown 
significant declines, and was at
 0.8%, 1.2%, and 1.7% 
in 2011.  
Questions 
about 
GHB and ketamine use 
were dropped from the  surveys of 8
th and 10
th graders
 in 2012
.  In 
2014, annual prevalence among 12
th graders for Rohypnol, GHB, and ket
amine was 
0.7%, 
1.0%, and 1.
5%, respectively
.  Annual prevalence 
for 
8th graders for Rohypnol was 0.
3% and 
for 
10
th graders
,  
0.5%
.  No questions about risk, disapproval, 
or availability are asked for 
these drugs.
 Trends in Ecstasy Use
 Ecstasy (3,4
-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or 
MDMA) is used 
mo
re for its mildly hallucinogenic 
properties than for its stimulant properties. Questions 

on ecstasy use were added to 
the
 surveys
 in 1996.  
 In 1996, a
nnual 
prevalence of 
ecstasy use was 4.6%
 in 
both 10
th and 12
th grades
Šconsiderably higher th
an
 among college students 
(2.8%) 
and young adults 
(1.7%)Šbut 
use declined
 over the next two years
.  Use
 then
 rose sharply
, 
bringing annual prevalence up 
to 
3.5% for 8
th g
raders, 6.2% for 1
0th graders
, 
and 
9.2% for 
12th graders
 by 2001.  From 
2001 to 2005, 
use declined substantially, down
 to 1.7%, 
2.6%, and 
3.0%, respectively
.  Following some 
irregular changes 
in recent years, in 201
4 
compared to 
2005, 
use was 
down slightly
 in 8
th grade (to 0.9%) and 10th grade (to 
2.3%) and
 up slightly in 
 12th grade (to 3
.6%).  ﬁMollyﬂ
Šr
eputed
 to
 be a purer form of ecstasy
Šreceived much attention in 2013; 
because
 that 
term 
was not used in the 2013 questionnaires
, i
t is not clear 
whether students included it in their answers about 
ecstasy use
 that year
.  The inclusion of Molly as 
an 
example in the 2014 questionnaire
s 
seemed to make 
little difference
 in reported prevalence,
 but the 2014 
data reported here are
 based on 
questionnaire forms 
not containing
 Molly as an example
 for comparability 
across the two years
. 
Perceived Risk of Ecstasy Use
 In 2001, 12
th graders™ perceived risk of ecstasy use 
jumped by eight percentage points and in 2002
, 
by 
another seven
.  Significant increases occurred in 2003 
for all grades
.  This sharp rise likely explains the drop 
in use that we predicted
.  From 2004 to 2011
, 
we saw 
a troubling drop in perceived risk (first among 8
th and 
10th, and then among 12
th graders), corresponding to 
the increase in use in the upper two grades and then in 
all three grades
.  This suggests a generational 
forgetting of the dangers of ecstasy use
. 
In 2012 only 
8th grade
rs
 showed much fur
ther decline
.  
The 
rebound in use after 2004 might be explained by the 

sizable drop in perceived risk, but the recent decline 
of perceived risk cannot explain the decline in use 
since 
2010. 
Disapproval of Ecstasy Use
 Disapproval of ecstasy use declined som
e after 1998 
but increased significantly in all three grades in 2002, 
perhaps due to the rise in perceived risk
.  
The rise in 
disapproval continued through 2003 for 8
th, 2004 for 
10th, and 2006 for 12
th graders, suggesting some 
cohort effect
.  After those
 peaks, disapproval dropped 
sharply among 8
th graders 
and
 less among 10
th graders 
before leveling
, and
 it
 did not drop among 12
th graders 
until 2010
Šagain suggesting a cohort effect
.  The 
erosion in perceived risk and disapproval
Šwhich 
was
 sharpest among 8
th graders
Šleft these 
groups more 
vulnerable to a possible rebound in use; some rebound 

appears to have occurred
 over the past decade
. 
Availability of Ecstasy
 The fi
gure shows a dramatic rise in 12
th graders™ 
perceived availability of ecstasy after 1991, particular
-ly between 1999 and 2001, consistent with informal 

reports about growing importation of the drug
.  Perceived availability then declined considerably in 
all grades after 2001 before leveling in the past few 
years.
 Decreased availability may 
help 
account for the 
drop in use in 2012.

 Alcohol
Alcoho
l 
has
 been widely used
 by American young 
people for a
 very
 long time
.  In 
2014 
the proportions 
of 8
th, 10
th, and 12
th graders who repo
rted drinking an 
alcoholic beverage in the 30
-day 
period prior to the 
survey were 
9%, 24
%, and 
37%, respectively
.  Various
 measures of alcohol use are presented in the 
tables at the end of this report
.  Here we 
focu
s 
on 
episodic heavy or ﬁbingeﬂ drinking (i.e., having 
five 
or mo
re drinks in a row
 at least once in the prior 
two weeks)Šthe pattern
 of alcohol con
sumption that is 
probably of greatest con
cern from a 
public health
 perspective.  
In 20
14 lifetime, annual, and 30
-day measures of alcohol use were at 
historic lows over the 
life of the study in all three 
grades, as was the measure of binge drinking.  Trends in Use
 Among 12
th graders, binge drinking peaked in 1979
 along with
 overall illicit 
drug use.  
The prevalence of 
binge drinking 
then
 declined
 substantially from 41% 
in 1983 to 28%
 in 1992, a drop of almost one third
 (also the low point of any illicit drug use)
.  Although 
illicit drug use rose 
sharply
 in the 1990s, binge 
drinking rose by only a small fraction
, 
and
 that
 rise
 was
 followed by some decline at all three grades
.  By 
2014, proportional declines since the recent peaks 
reached in the 1990s 
were
 69
%, 48
%, and 
38% for 
grades 8, 10, and 12, resp
ectively (Table 8)
.   It should be noted that there is no evidence of any 
displacement effect in the aggregate between alcohol 
and marijuana
Ša hypothesis frequently heard
.  The 
two drugs have moved much more in parallel over the 
years than in opposite
 directions, at least until 
about a 
five
-year
 period in the 2000s
, during which alcohol 
continued to decline while marijuana reversed course 
and rose.  
Moreove
r, these two behaviors have 
consistently been positively correlated at the 
individual level.
 Perceived Risk
 Throughout most of the life of the MTF study, the 
majority of 12
th graders have not viewed binge
 drinking on weekends as carrying a great risk
.  However, an increase from 36% to 49% occurred 
between 1982 and 1992.  
A 
decline to 43% followed 
by 1997 as use rose, before 
risk
 stabilized
.  Since 
2003, perceived risk has risen some in all grades, at 
least through 2011. These changes are consistent with 

changes in actual binge drinking
.  We believe that the 
public servi
ce advertising campaigns in the 1980s 
against drunk driving, as well as those that urged use 
of designated drivers when drinking, contributed to 
the increase in perceived risk of binge drinking 

generally
.  Drunk driving by 12
th graders declined 
during 
that period by an even larger proportion than 
binge drinking.
11 Also, we 
showed
 that increases in 
the minimum drinking age during the 1980s were 

followed by reductions in drinking and increases in 

perceived risk associated with drinking.
12 Disapproval
 Disapp
roval of weekend binge drinking moved fairly 
parallel with perceived risk, suggesting that such 

drinking (and very likely the drunk
-driving behavior 
associated with it) became increasingly unacceptable 

in the peer group.  
Note that the rates of disapprov
al 
and perceived risk for binge drinking are higher in the 

lower grades than in 12
th grade
.  As with perceived 
risk, disapproval has increased appreciably in all 

grades, though it has leveled some
 among 8
th graders.
 Availability
 Perceived availability
 of alcohol, which until 1999 
was asked only of 8
th and 10
th graders, was very high 
and mostly steady in the 1990s
.  Since 1996, however, 
there have been 
substantial 
declines in 8
th and 10
th grades
.  For 12
th grade, availability has declined 
only 
modestly with 
88% 
in 2014 
still saying that 
alcohol
 would be fairly
 or very
 easy to get
.  Overall, it appears 
that states, communities, and parents have been 

successful in reducing access to alcohol among the 

younger teens.

 Cigarettes
Ci
garette smoking is the leading cause of preventable 
disease and mortality in the United States, and is 
usually initiated in adolescence
.  That makes what 

happens in adolescence particularly important.
 Trends in Use
 Differences in smoking rates between various birth 
cohorts (or, in this case, school class cohorts) tend to 

stay with those cohorts throughout the life cycle
.  This 

means that it is critical to prevent smoking very early
. It also means that the trends in a given historical 
period may differ across various grade levels as 

changes in use occurring earlier in adolescence work 

their way up the age spectrum (
 i.e., ﬁcohort effectsﬂ).
 Am
ong 12
th graders, 30
-day prevalence of smoking 
reached a peak in 1976
 at 39%.  
(The peak likely 
occurred considerably earlier at lower grade levels as 

these same class cohorts passed through them in 

previous years.) 
After
 about a one
-quarter drop in 
12th-gra
de 30
-day prevalence between 1976 and 1981, 
the rate remained there until 1992 (28%)
.  In the 
1990s, smoking began to rise sharply, after 1991 

among 8
th and 10
th graders and 1992 among 12
th graders
.  Over the next four to five years, smoking 
rate
s increased by about one half in the lower two 
grades and by almost one third in grade 12
Švery 
substantial increases to which MTF drew 
considerable 

public attention
.  Smoking peaked in 1996 for 8
th and 
10th graders and in 1997 for 12
th graders befo
re 
beginning a fairly steady and substantial decline that 
continued through 2004 for 8
th and 10
th graders
.  Between the peak levels in the mid
-1990s and 2004, 
30-day prevalence of smoking declined by 56% in 8
th grade, 47% in 10
th, and 32% in 12
th.  This important 
decline in adolescent smoking decelerated after about 

2002.  Still, by 
2014, 30-day prevalence levels were 
down from peak levels by 
81%, 77
%, and 
63% in 
grades 8, 10, and 12
, respectively
.  
An increase in 
2009 in federal taxes on ciga
rettes (from $0.39 to 
$1.01 per pack) may have contributed to th
e recent 
decline in use
.  Smoking initiation by 8
th graders 
declined by seven tenths, from a peak of 49% in 1996 
to just 
14% by 
2014.   Per
ceived Risk
 Among 12
th graders, the proportion seeing great risk 
in pack
-a-
day smoking rose before and during the first 
period of decline in use in the late 1970s.  
It leveled in 

1980 (before use leveled), declined a bit in 1982, but 

then started to rise again gradually for f
ive years
.  
(It 
is possible that cigarette advertising effectively offset 
the influence of rising perceptions of risk during that 
period.) Perceived risk fell some in the early 1990s at 

all three grade levels as use increased sharply
.  Since 
then, there has generally been an increase (though not 

entirely consistently) in perceived risk
, at least 
through 2011.  
All three grades showed an increase in 

2011, accompanied by a decline in use; the 2012 

levels of perceived risk 
were
 the highest ever 
observed
, 
but they leveled
 after that
.  Note the 
differences in the extent of perceived risk among 
grade levels
.  
There is a clear age effect
: 
by the time 
most youngsters fully appreciate the hazards of 
smoking, many already 
have 
initiated the behavior.
 Disappr
oval
 Disapproval rates for smoking 
have been fairly high 
throughou
t the study and, unlike perceived risk, are 
higher in the lower grade levels
.  Among 12
th graders, 
there was a gradual increase in disapproval of 
smoking from 1976 to 1986, some erosion 
over the 

following five years, and then steeper erosion from 

the early 1990s through 1997.  After 1997, 
disapproval rose for some years in all three grades, 

but leveled in grade 12 after 2006 and 
in the lower 
grades after 2007
.  We measure a number of 
other 
smoking
-related attitudes; these became increasingly 
negative for some years, but leveled off five
 or six 
years ago (see Table 3 in the 
2014 
MTF press release 
on teen smoking,
 Use of alcohol, cigarettes, and a 
number of illicit drugs declines among U.S. 
teens).  Though disapproval did increase
 in the upper grades 
in 2014, 
most attitudes and beliefs about cigarette 
smoking are no longer moving in a direction tha
t 
would discourage use, suggesting that external 
changes in the environment may be required to further 
reduce youth smoking.
 Availability
 Since 1996, availability has declined considerably, 
especially among 8
th and 10
th graders
.  Some 
47% of 
8th graders and 
69% of 10
th graders now say that 
cigarettes would be
 very easy or
 fairly 
easy to get, 
reflecting declines of 
39
% and 
24
%,
 respectively

 Smokeless Tobacco
Traditionally, smokeless tobacco
 has come in two 
forms: ﬁsnuffﬂ an
d ﬁchew.ﬂ Snuff is finely ground 
tobacco usually sold in tins, either loose or in packets
.  It is held in the mouth between the lip or cheek and 
the gums
.  Chew is a leafy form of 
tobacco, usually 
sold in pouches
.  It too is held in the mouth and may, 
as the name implies, be chewed
.  In both cases, 
nicotine is absorbed by the mucous membranes of the 
mouth
.  These forms are sometimes called ﬁspitﬂ 
tobacco because users expectorate the tobacco juices 

and saliva (stimulated by the tobacco) 
that 
accumulate 
in the mouth
.  ﬁSnusﬂ (rhymes with goose) is 
a 
relatively new variation on smokeless tobacco, 
as are 
some other 
dissolvable tobacco
 products that 
literally 
dissolve in the mouth
.  Given
 that snus appeared
 to 
be gaining in popula
ity, separate items regarding the 
use in th
e past 12 mon
ths of snus and dissolvable 
tobacco were added to the 1
2th-grade survey
s in 
2011 and to
 the 8
th- and 10
th-grade surveys in 2012.  
In additio
n, in 
2011 snus an
d dissolvable tob
acco were added as 
examples to th
e long
-standing question on smokeless tobacco.   Trends in Use
 The use of smokeless tobacco by teens had been 
decreasing gradually, and 
30-day prevalence
 is now 
between one third and two thirds of the recent peak 

level
s in the mid
-1990s, though there was a reversal 
of the declines from about 2007 through 2010
.  Among 8
th graders, 30
-day prevalence declined from 
a 1994 peak of 7.7% to 3.2% in 2007.  
It reached a 
low of 2.8% in 2013
, 
about where it remained in 
2014.  Among 10
th graders,  use declined from a 1994 
peak of 10.5% to 4.9% by 2004
, then
 rose to 6.4% in 
2013 before dropping 
again 
to 5.3% in 2014
. A
mong 
12th graders, use declined from a 1995 peak of 12.2% 
to 6.1% by 2006 but rose to 8.
4% in 
2009,
 where it 
remained in
 2014.  Thirty
-day prevalence of
 daily use
 of smokeless tobacco fell gradually
 but appreciably
 for some years
.  Daily usage
 rates in 
201
4 
were 0.5%, 
1.8%, and 3.
4% in grades 8, 10, and 12, 
respectively
Šdown substantially from peak levels 
recorded in the 1990s
Šbut the declines in daily use 
have leveled 
in 
all three
 grades.
 Smokeless tobacco use among American young 
people is almost exclusively a male behavior
.  
Among 
males the 30
-day prevalence rates in 
201
4 
were 3.8%, 
8.9%, and 14.
3% in grades 8, 10, and 12, versus 
2.2%, 1.9
%, and 
2.1% for females
.  The respective 
current daily use rates for males were 0.9%, 3.
4%, 
and 6.5
% compared to 0.
3%, 0.4%, and 0.
1% for 
females.
 Annual prevalence in 201
4 
for 
snus
 was 2.
2%, 4.5
%, 
and 
5.8
% among 8
th, 10th, and 12
th graders, 
respectively
, reflecting a decline since 2012 in all 
three grades
.  For 
dissolvable tobacco
, the 
corresponding figures were 1.1%, 1.
3%, and 1.
1%
, reflecting little change since 2012
.   Perceived Risk
 The most recent low point in the level of perceived 
risk for smokeless tobacco was 1995 in all three 

grades (though for 12
th graders it was considerably 
lower in the mid
-1980s)
.  For a decade fo
llowing 
1995 there was a gradual but substantial increase in 
proportions saying that there is a great risk in using 
smokeless tobacco regularly
.  It thus appears that one 
important reason for the appreciable declines in 

smokeless tobacco use during the latter half of the 

1990s was that an increasing proportion of young 
people were persuaded of the dangers of using it
.  But 
the increases in perceived risk ended by 2004, and it 

has declined some in the interval since then
.  The 
decline could be due to generational forgetting of the 

dangers of use, the increased marketing of snus and 
other smokeless products, and/or public statements 
about smokeless tobacco use being relatively less 

dangerous than cigarette smoking
.  In 
2014 
perceived 
risk 
continued to 
decline
.   Disapproval
 Only 8
th and 10
th graders are asked about their 
personal disapproval of using smokeless tobacco 

regularly
.  The most recent low points for disapproval 
in both grades were 1995 and 1996
.  Disapproval rose 
among 
8th graders from 74% 
in 1996 to 82% in 2005, 
where it remained in 2013 (82%)
 before dropping 
back to 80% in 2014
.  For
 10th graders,
 disapproval 
rose 
from 71% in 1996 to 82% in 2008
, 
with a 
significant decline since 2008 to 
79
% in 
2014.  Thus, 
both perceived risk and disapproval of smokeless 

tobacco use have ﬁsoftenedﬂ in the past few years.
 Availability
 There are no questions on perceived availability of 
smokeless tobacco.

(no data) E-
cigarettes
E-
cigarett
es are battery
-powered devices with a 
heating element
.  They produce an aerosol, or 
vapor, that users inhale
.  Typically this vapor 
contains nicotine.  
The specific contents of the 
vapor are proprietary and are not 
currently 
regulated
.  The liquid
 that is vaporized in e
-cigarettes comes in hundreds of flavors.  Some of 

these flavors, such as bubble gum and milk 

chocolate cream, are likely attractive to younger 

teens.
 In 2014 more te
ens 
use
d e-
cigarettes
 in the pas
t 30 
days
 than traditional tobacco cigarett
es or any other 
tobacco product
.  MTF is the first national study to 
document this finding
.  Specifically, 
30-day 
prevalence of e
-cigarette use was 8.7%, 16.2%, and 
17.1% in 
8th, 10
th, and 12
th grade
.  The 
corresponding prevalence for 
tobacco 
cigarette use 
was 4.0%, 7.2%, and 13.6%.  
Note that in 8
th and 
10th grades e
-cigarette prevalence is more than 
twice the prevalence of regular cigarettes
.  The 
difference is considerably less at 12
th grade, which 
may be due to the newness of e
-cigarettes: they 
may not have been used earlier by today™s 12
th graders.
 A major c
oncern in the public health community is 
that e
-cigarettes may serve as a point of entry into 
the use of nicotine, an addictive 
drug
.  The 
percentages of past 30
-day e
-cigarette users who 
had 
never smoked a tobacco cigarette 
range
d 
from 
4% to 7% in 8
th, 10th, and 12
th grade
s 
in 2014.  
For 
these youth
, e-
cigarettes 
appear to be
 a primary 
source of nicotine
 and not a supplement to tobacco 
cigarette use
.  Whether youth who use e
-cigarettes 
exclusively later become tobacco cigarette smokers 

is yet to be determined by this study
 and is of 
substantial consequence
. 
Perceived
 Risk
 Substantially fewer students associate ﬁgreat riskﬂ 

with using e
-cigarettes regularly as compared to 
smoking one or more packs of cigarettes per day
.  In 8
th, 10th, and 12
th grades the percentage of 
students who perceive ﬁgreat riskﬂ in using e
-cigar
ettes regularly is 14.5%, 14.1%, and 14.2%, 
respectively
.  The corresponding percentages for 
risk associated with smoking one or more packs of 

cigarettes a day 
are
 62%, 72%, and 78%
.  E-
cigarettes have the lowest perceived risk for regular 

use 
than any other drug in the survey, including 
alcohol.
 Data on av
ailability and disapproval of e
-cigarettes 
have
 not been gathered so far.

(no data)   Small Cigars and
 Tobacco Using a Hookah
 Twelfth graders were first asked about smoking small 

cigars and smoking tobacco using a hookah (water 

pipe) in 2010.  
These questions were not asked of 8
th and 10
th graders.
 Only the prevalence and frequency 
of use in the past 12 months 
were
 reported
; 
we use 
this prevalence period, which requires only a single 

question, to determine whether additional questions 

on the substance may be warranted in future surveys
.  We call 
this a
 ﬁtripwireﬂ
 question
. 
 
Smoking Tobacco Using a Hookah.  
The 
past year
 prevalence rate in 
2014 
was 
23% for hookah 
smoking
, 
up significantly from 17% in 2010
.  Only 
about 16
% of the 12
th-grade students in 
2014 
indicated use on more than two occasions during the 

past 12 months
, which suggests that a considerable 
amount of hookah use is light or experimental.  
Males 

are slightly more likely than females to 
use hookahs
 (25% of males and 21% of females in 
2014). 
 
Small Cigars
.  Small or little cigars
Šalso called 
cigar
illos
Šcan be the size and shape of a cigarette, 
but they are classified as cigars because they are 

wrapped in brown paper, which contains some 
tobacco leaf, rather than in white paper
.  The annual 
prevalence rate for small or little cigars (our question 
uses the term ﬁsmall cigarsﬂ) 
in 2014 
was similar to 
that for hookah smoking
Š19%.  Smoking small 
cigars decreased significantly since 2010, when 

annual prevalence was
 23%
.  Unlike hookah smoking, 
use of small cigars shows a sizable gender difference
: 

the 
201
4 
annual prevalence for 12
th grade males was 
26% compared to 
12% 
for
 females
.  The increases in 
the 
federal taxes on tobacco products, instituted in 
2009, may well have played a role in leveling or 
decreasing the use of small cigars
.  The increase on a 
pack of small cigars 
fell under 
the same 
regulations 
as 
regular cigarettes (f
rom $0.39 to $1.01 per pack)
.  Some producers of small cigars subsequently 
increased the weight of the cigars 
slightly 
in order to 
avoid the taxes placed on cigarettes and to remove 

them from FDA control under current law
.  Eleven 
percent of 12
th graders indicated having used small 
cigars on more than two occasions during the year, 

and only 2% on more than 20 occasions.  
  Some small cigars are flavored, which is likely to 
make them more attractive to young peo
ple
.  A concern in the public health community is that these 

products will have the effect of reversing the hard
-won gains in reducing cigarette smoking among 
youth
.  Small cigars
 deliver and combust tobacco 
in 
similar ways and therefore 
carry 
similar 
dangers

(no data) Steroids
Unlike all other drugs discussed in this 
Overview
, anabolic steroids are not usually taken for their 
psychoactive effects but rather for muscle and 

strength developmen
t.  
However, they are similar to 
most other drugs studied here in two respects: they are 

controlled substances for which there is an illicit 

market, and they can have adverse consequences for 

the user
.  Questions about steroid use were added to 
MTF questionnaires beginning in 1989.  
Respondents 
are asked: ﬁSteroids, or anabolic steroids, are 
sometimes prescribed by doctors to promote healing 

from certain types of injuries
.  Some athletes, and 
others, have used them to try to increase muscle 

developm
ent
.  On how many occasions (if any) have 
you taken steroids on your own
Šthat is, without a 
doctor telling you to take them 
.  .  .  
?ﬂ In 2006 the 
question text was changed slightly in some 

questionnaire forms
Šthe phrase ﬁto promote healing 
from 
certain types of injuriesﬂ was replaced by ﬁto 
treat certain conditions.ﬂ The resulting data did not 
show any effect from this rewording
.  In 2007 the 
remaining forms were changed in the same manner.
 Trends in Use
 Anabolic steroids are used predominately by males; 

therefore, data based on all respondents can mask the 
higher rates and larger fluctuations that occur among 

males
.  (For example, in 
2014, annual prevalence 
rates were 0.
6%, 1.
1%, and 2.
0% for boys in grades 8, 
10, and 12, compared with 0.
5%,
 0.5%, and 0.7% for 
girls.) Between 1991 and 1998, the overall annual 

prevalence rate was fairly stable among 8
th and 10
th graders, ranging between 0.9% and 1.2%.  In 1999, 

however, use jumped from 1.2% to 1.7% in both 8
th and 10
th grades
.  (Al
most all of that increase occurred 
among boys
, 
increasing from 1.6% in 1998 to 2.5% in 
1999 in 8
th grade and from 1.9% to 2.8% in 10
th grade
.  Thus, rates among boys increased by about 
half in a single year.) Among all 8
th graders, steroid 
use declined by two thirds to 0.6% 
by 2014.  Among 
10th graders, use continued to increase, reaching 2.2% 
in 2002, but then declined by
 about
 two thirds
 to 0.8% 
by 
2014.  In 12
th grade there was a different trend 
story
.  With 
data going back to 1989, we can see that 
steroid use first fell from 1.9% overall in 1989 to 
1.1% in 1992
Šthe low point
.  From 1992 to 1999 
there was a more gradual increase in use, reaching 
1.7% in 2000.  
In 2001, use rose significantly among 
12th g
raders to 2.4% (possibly reflecting a cohort 
effect with the younger, heavier
-using cohorts getting 
older)
.  Twelfth graders
™ 
use decreased significantly 
in 2005 to 1.5%, and in 
201
4 
it 
was again at 1.5%
.  Use is now down from recent peak levels by 
67
%, 
64
%, and 43% among 8
th, 10th, and 12
th graders, 
respectively
.  (The use of androstenedione
Ša steroid 
precursor
Šhas also declined sharply since 2001.)
 Perceived Risk
 Perceived risk and disapproval were asked of 8
th and 
10th graders for only a few years
.  All grades seemed 
to have a peak in perceived risk around 1993.  
The 

longer term data from 12
th graders show a ten 
percentage
-point drop between 1998 and 2000, and an 
additional three percentage
-point drop by 2003 (to 
55%).  A change this sharp is quite unusual and 

highly significant, suggesting that some particular 

event or events in 1998
Šquite possibly publicity 
about use of performance
-enhancing substances by 
famous athletes, in particular use of androstenedione 

by a famous home
-run-hitting baseball player
Šmade 
steroids seem less risky
.  It seems likely that perceived 
risk dropped substantially in the lower grades as well, 

and the sharp upturn in their use that year would be 
consistent with such a change
.  By 
2006, perceived 
risk for 12
th graders was up to 60%,with little change 
until 2013 when it showed a significant 4.4 
percentage point decline, reaching 54%, the lowest 

point ever.  It stands at 55% in 2014
. 
Disapproval
 Disapproval of steroid use has been quite high for 

some years
.  Between 1998 and 2003 there was a 
modest decrease, though not as dramatic as the drop 
in perceived risk
.  From 2003 to 2008, disapproval 
rose some
Šas perceived risk rose and use declined
Šthen leveled
 and 
has declined since
  
2012
. 
Availability
 Perceived availability of steroids was relatively high 
prior to 2001 or 2002
, 
but it declined appreciably at 
all grades through 201
4, reaching 
the lowest level 
recorded by the study
.  Some steroids were previously 
sold over the 
counter, but now a number have been 
scheduled by the DEA
, no doubt contributing to the 
drop in availability
.  
Androstenedione was classified 
as a Schedule III controlled substance in 2005.

 Subgroup Differences
Unders
tanding the important subgroup variations in 
substance use among the nation™s youth allows for 
more informed considerations of substance use 

etiology and prevention.  
In this section, we present a 

brief overview of some of the ma
jor demographic 
subgroup differences.
 Space does not permit a full discussion or documentation of the many subgroup differences of the drugs covered in this report.  However, Volume I in this series contains tables providing the 2014 subgroup prevalence levels for all of the classes of drugs discussed here; Chapters 4 and 5 in Volume I have in-depth discussion and interpretation of those subgroup differences.  Comparisons are made by gender, race/ethnicity, college plans, region of the country, community size, and socioeonomic level (as measured by educational level of the parents).  In addition, an annual Monitoring the Future Occasional Paper (most recently number 81 containing data through 2014) provides tables giving the subgroup prevalence levels and trends for all of the classes of drugs discussed here as well as charts of the subgroup trends for all drugs; the Occasional Paper is available on the MTF website (Demographic subgroup trends among adolescents in the use of various licit and illicit drugs 1975-2014™ available at http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/occpapers/mtf-occ81.pdf).  The graphs in the occasional paper present easily accessible views of trends and comparisons while the paper™s tables provide the specific numbers behind the figures. . Gender
 Generally, we have found males to have somewhat 
higher rates of illicit drug use than females (especially 

higher rates of 
frequent
 use),
 most notably by 12
th grade
; 
and much higher rates of smokeless tobacco 
and steroid use.  
Gender differences in 30
-day alcohol 
use differ by grade.  Among 8
th graders, the 
differences are very small, with females consistently 

reporting 
slightly higher 
rates 
than males since 200
2.  Among 10
th graders, males have generally, though not 
always, 
provided
 higher 
rates 
than females; males 
consistently were 
slightly higher 
in use 
than females 
between
 2009 and 2013, 
but 
females were slightly 
higher in 2014.  Among 12
th graders, males have 
consistently reported
 distinctly higher 
30-day alcohol 
usage rates than females
.  Gender differences in binge 
drinking follow a similar pattern
Šfemales 
report 
higher 
rates in
 8
th grade, males 
somewhat higher 
rates
 in 10
th grade, and 
males 
distinctly higher
 rates in 12
th grade 
(though 
the gap is 
narrowing)
.  Gender 
differences in 30
-day cigarette smoking among
 8
th and
 10th graders have generally been minimal, but
 10th grade
 males 
have reported
 slightly higher 
rates 
than 
females 
in recent years
.  Among 12
th graders, females 
generally had higher rates of smoking than males 
through 1990, 
but since then males have generally had 
the higher rates
Šthe exception being that at 8
th grade 
females have had 
slightly 
higher rates in the past 
several
 years
.  
The various gender differences in 
substance use appear to emerge for many drugs as 
students grow older.  
In 8
th grade, females have higher 
rates of use for some drugs, such as inhalants and 
amphetamines
.  Usage rates 
for both genders for the 
various substances generally tend to move much in 

parallel across time, and the absolute differences tend 

to be largest in 
the historical periods in which overall 
prevalence rates are highest.
 Race/Ethnicity
 Among the most dramatic and interesting subgroup 

differences are those found among the three largest 

racial/ethnic groups
ŠWhites, African
 Americans, 
and Hispanics
.  For a 
number of years African
-American students had substantially lower rates of use 

of any illicit drug than did Whites, but the differences 

have narrowed in recent years in the lower grades as a 

result of increasing marijuana use among African
-American 
students
.  (Marijuana use tends to drive the 
overall index.) Still, African
 Americans have lower 
levels of use for most licit and illicit drugs at all three 

grade levels
Šin particular for hallucinogens, ecstasy, 
and all forms of prescription drugs.  
Their use of 
alcohol, and cigarettes, is also lower
.  In fact, African
 Americans™ use of cigarettes has been dramatically 

lower than Whites™ use
Ša difference that emerged 
largely during the life of the study (i.e., since 1975).
 His
panic students 
generally have had rates of use that 
tended to place them between the other two groups in 

12th grade
Šusually closer to the rates for Whites than 
for African Americans
.  In 
the last few years, 
however,
 Hispanics have attained the highest reported 
rates
 of use
 of any illicit drug
Šin large part due to 
 thei
r greater increase in marijuana use
.  (Indeed, 
African Americans and Hispanics have shown a 
considerably greater increase in marijuana use than 
Whites
 have
.)  I
n 12th grade 
Hispanics have the 
highest use rates for a number of substances
Šmarijuana, inhalants, cocaine, crack, 
methamphetamine, 
and 
crystal methamphetamine
.  In 8th grade
, 
Hispanics
 tend to 
report the
 highest rates 
of 
the three racial/ethnic groups on nearly all classes of 
drugs
.  One possible explanation for this change in 
ranking between 8
th and 12
th grade may lie in the 
considerably higher school dropout rates of Hispanic 

youth
; 
compared to the other two racial/ethnic groups
, 
More of the drug
-prone segment of Hispanic students 
may leave school before 12
th grade
.  
Another 
explanation could be that Hispanics are more 

precocious in their initiation of these typ
es of 
behaviors
.  Like African
-American students, Hispanic 
students generally have lower rates than White 

students of misusing any of the prescription drugs
, particularly in the upper grades
. 
Again, we refer the reader to Occasional Paper 81 
for 
a much
 more complete picture of these complex 
subgroup differences and how they have changed 

over the years (
Demographic subgroup trends among 
adolescents in the use of various licit 
and illicit drugs 
1975-2013).
 College Plans
 While in high school, those students who are not 

college
-bound (a
 decreasing proportion of the total 
youth population) are considerably more likely to be 

at risk for using illicit drugs, drinking heavily, and 
particularly smoking cigarettes
.  Again, these dif
-ferences are largest in periods of highest prevalence
.  In the lower grades, 
the college
-bound 
had a greater 
increase in cigarette smoking
 than did their non
-college
-bound peers
 in the early to mid
-1990s
; but 
the 
college
-bound
 also showed a considerably 
larger 
decline since then, leaving them with dramatically 

lower smoking rates at present
 than they had in th
e 
1990s. 
Region of the Country
 The differences associated with region of the country 

are
 so
 sufficiently varied and complex that we cannot 
do justic
e to them here
.  In the past, the Northeast and 
West tended to have the highest proportions of 

students using any illicit drug, and the South
, 
the 
lowest; however, these rankings do not apply to many 

of the specific drugs and do not apply to all grades 

today
.  In particular, the cocaine epidemic of the early 
1980s was much more pronounced in the West and 

Northeast than in the other two regions, although the 

differences decreased as the overall epidemic 

subsided
.  While the South and West have generall
y had lower rates of drinking among students than the 
Northeast and the Midwest, those differences have 
narrowed somewhat in recent years
.  
Cigarette 
smoking rates have generally been lowest in the West
.  The upsurge of ecstasy use in 1999 occurred pri
marily 
in the Northeast, but that drug™s newfound popularity 
then spread to the three other regions of the country.
 Population Density
 There have not been very large or consistent 
differences in overall illicit drug use associated with 

population density 
since MTF began, helping to 
demonstrate just how ubiquitous the illicit drug 
phenomenon has been in this country.  
Crack and 

heroin use have generally not been concentrated in 

urban areas, as is commonly believed, meaning that 

no parents and schools shou
ld assume that their 
children are immune to these threats simply because 
they do not live in a city
.  Since the late 1990s, 
students in non
-urban areas have emerged 
with
 higher 
smoking rates than others, particularly
 in the upper 
grades
.  F
or alcohol use there have not been large 
differences as a function of population density.
 Socioeconomic Level
 The average level of education of the student™s 

parents, as reported by the student, is used as a proxy 

for socioeconomic status of the family
.  For many 
drugs the differences in use by socioeconomic class 

are very small, and the trends have been highly 

parallel
.  One very interesting difference occurred for 
cocaine, the use of which was 
positively
 associated 
with socioeconomic level in the ea
rly 1980s
.  However, with the advent of crack, which offered 

cocaine at a lower price, that association nearly 

disappeared by 1986.  
Cigarette smoking showed a 

similar narrowing of class differences, but
 in 
 this 
case 
a large 
negative
 associatio
n with socioeconomic level 
diminished considerably between roughly 1985 and 

1993.  In more recent years, that negative association 

has re
-emerged in the lower grades as use declined 
faster among students from more educated families
.  We believe that the removal of the Joe Camel ad 
 camp
aign may have played a role in this
.  
With regard 
to alcohol, in recent years there has been essentially 
no association between parental education and binge 
drinking among 12
th graders, a small negative 
correlat
ion among 10
th graders, and a somewhat 
stronger negative correlation among 8
th graders
.  Interestingly, the bottom one of the five SES strata 
has had the highest level of binge drinking in 8
th and 
10th grades, but the lowest level in 12
th grade
.    Lessons Learned
Implications for Prevention
 The wide divergence in historical trajectories of the 
various drugs over time helps to illustrate that, to a 

considerable degree, the determinants
 of use are often 
specific to each drug
.  These determinants include 
both perceived benefits and perceived adverse 

outcomes that young people come to associate with 

each drug.
 Unfortunately, w
ord of the supposed benefits of using 
a drug usually spreads
 much faster than information 
about the adverse consequences
.  Supposed benefits 
take only rumor and a few testimonials, the spread of 

which have been hastened and expanded greatly by 

the media and 
in particular 
the 
Internet
.  It usually 
takes much l
onger for the evidence of adverse 

consequences (e.g., adverse reactions, death, disease, 

overdose, addiction) to cumulate
, be recognized,
 and 
then be disseminated
.  Thus, when a new drug comes 
onto the scene, it has a considerable ﬁgrace periodﬂ 

during w
hich its benefits are alleged and its 
consequences are not yet known
.  We believe that 
ecstasy illustrated this dynamic
.  
Synthetic marijuana 
and so
-called ﬁbath saltsﬂ are two more recent 
examples where evidence of adverse outcomes is only 

beginning t
o catch up to the push that these drugs 
have received through the Internet and the media.
 Although 
advocati
ng for avoiding or 
delaying all
 substance use is likely beneficial, especially at young 

ages, prevention ef
forts also need to be drug
-specific
.  That is, to a considerable degree, prevention must 

occur drug by drug because people will not 

necessarily generalize the adverse consequences of 

one drug to the use of others.  
Many beliefs and 

attitudes held by young people are drug
 specific
.  The 
figures in this 
Overview
 on perceived risk and 
disapproval for the various drugs
Šattitudes and 
beliefs that we have shown to be important in 

explaining many drug trends over the years
Šamply 
illustrate this assertion
.  
These attitudes and beliefs are 
at quite different levels for the various drugs and, 

more importantly, often trend quite differently over 

time.
 Marijuana is one drug that is affected by some very 
specific policies, including medicalization and 

legaliz
ation of recreational use by adults
.  The effects 
on youth behaviors and attitudes of recent changes in 
a number o
f states will need to be carefully monitored 
in future years
 to determine their longer
-term effects
.  Currently, marijuana does not hold 
the same appeal 
for youth as it did in the past, and today™s annual 
prevalnce among 12
th graders of 
35% is considerably 
lower than rates exceeding 50% in the 1970s 
(documented by this project)
.  
However, if states that 
legalize recreational marijuana al
low marijuana 

advertising and marketing, then prevalence  could 

rebound and approach or even surpass past levels
.   ﬁG
enerational Forgettingﬂ Helps Keep the 
Drug Epidemic Going
 Another point worth keeping in mind is that there 
tends to be a continuous fl
ow of new drugs onto the 
scene and of older ones being rediscovered by young 
people.  
Many drugs have made a comeback years 
after they first fell from popularity, often because 

knowledge among youth of their adverse 
consequences faded as generational 
replacement took 
place.  
We call this process ﬁgenerational for
getting.ﬂ Examples include LSD and methamphetamine, two 

drugs used widely in the 1960s that made a comeback 

in the 1990s after their initial popularity faded as a 
result of their adverse con
sequences becoming widely 
recognized during periods of high use.  
Heroin, cocaine, PCP, and crack are some others that have 

followed a similar pattern
.  
LSD, inhalants, and 
ecstasy have all shown some effects of generational 
forgetting in recent years
Šthat is, perceived risk has 
declined appreciably for those drugs
, pa
rticularly among the younger students
Šwhich puts future 
cohorts at greater risk of having a resurgence in use
.  
In the case of LSD, perceived risk among 8
th graders has declined noticeably, and more students are saying 
that they are not familiar with the drug
.  
It would appear that 
a resurgence in availability
 (which declined very sharply after about 2001, most likely 
due to the FDA closing a major lab in 2000) could 

generate another increase in use. 
As for newly emergin
g drugs, ex
amples in
clude nitrite inhalan
ts and PCP in the 1970s; crack and 
crystal methamp
hetamine in
 the 1980s; Rohypnol, 
GHB, and ecstasy in the 1990s; dextromethorphan, 
and salvia in the 2000s
; and ﬁbath salts
ﬂ ﬁsynthetic marijuanaﬂand e
-cigarettes  more recently
.  
The frequent introduction of new drugs (or new forms or  new m
odes of administration of older drugs, as 
illustrated by crack, crystal methamphetamine, and 
non-injected heroin) helps keep this nation™
s drug 
problem alive
.  Because of the lag times described 

previously, the forces of containment are always 

playing catch
-up with the forces of encouragement 
and exploitation
.  Organized efforts to reduce the 
grace period experienced by new drugs would
 seem 
to be among the most promising responses for 
minimizing the
 damage they will cause
.  Such efforts 
regarding ecstasy by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse and others appeared to pay off.

Notes.    
' Œ ' indicates data not available.  ' ⁄ ' indicates a change in the question text.  When a question change occurs, peak levels after that change are used to calculate the peak year to current year difference.
 Values in bold equal peak levels since 1991. Values in italics equal peak level before wording change. Underlined values equal lowest level since recent peak level. 
Level of significance of difference between classes: s = .05, ss = .01, 
sss = .
001.Any apparent inconsistency between the change estimate and the prevalence estimates for the two most recent years is due to rou
nding.
aThe proportional change is the percent by which the most recent year deviates from the peak year [or the low year] for the drug in question. So, if a drug was at 20% prevalence in the peak year and declined to 10% prevalence in the 
  most recent year, that would reflect a proportional decline of 50%.
bIn 2013, for the questions on the use of amphetamines, the text was changed on two of the questionnaire forms for 8th and 10th graders and four of the questionnaire forms for 12th graders.  This change also impacted the any illicit drug indices.  Data pr
esented 
here include only the changed forms beginning in 2013.
cIn 2014, for the questions on the use of ecstasy, the text was changed on one of the questionnaire forms for 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.  Data presented here for 2014 include only the unchanged forms.

Notes.    
' Œ ' indicates data not available.  ' ⁄ ' indicates a change in the question text.  When a question change occurs, peak levels
 after that change are used to calculate the peak year to current year difference.
 Values in bold equal peak levels since 1991. Values in italics equal peak level before wording change. Underlin
ed values equal lowest level since recent peak level. 
Level of significance of difference between classes: s = .05, ss = .01, sss = .001. 
Any apparent inconsistency between the change estimate and the prevalence estimates for the two most recent years is due to rou
nding.
aThe proportional change is the percent by which the most recent year deviates from the peak year [or the low year] for the drug in question. So, if a drug was at 20% prevalence in the peak year and declined to 10% prevalence in the 
  most recent year, that would reflect a proportional decline of 50%.
bQuestion was discontinued among 8th and 10th graders in 2012.
cIn 2013, for the questions on the use of amphetamines, the text was changed on two of the questionnaire forms for 8th and 10th 
graders and four of the questionnaire forms for 12th graders.  This change also impacted the any 
illicit drug indices.  Data presented 
here include only the changed forms beginning in 2013.
dIn 2014, for the questions on the use of ecstasy, the text was changed on one of the questionnaire forms for 8th, 10th, and 12t
h graders.  Data presented here for 2014 include only the unchanged forms.

Notes.  
Level of significance of difference between 
the two most recent classes: s = .05, ss = .01, sss = .001. ' Š ' indicates data no
t available. ' ⁄ ' indicates some change in the question. See 
relevant footnote for that dr
ug. Any apparent inconsistency 
between the change estimate and the prev
alence estimates for the two most recent years is due to rounding. 
aFor 12th graders only: Use of any illicit dr
ug includes any use of marijuana, LSD, ot
her hallucinogens, crack, other cocaine, o
r heroin; or an
yuse of narcotics other than heroin, amphetam
ines, sedatives (barbitura
tes), or tr
anquilizers not under a doctor™s orders. For 8
th and 10th 
graders only: The use of narcotics other
 than heroin and sedatives 
(barbiturates) has been ex
cluded because these younger 
respondents appear to overreport use 
(perhaps because they include the 
use of nonprescription drugs in
 their answers). Due to c
hangesin the amphetamines questions 2013 data for all grades for any illicit drug use, any
 illicit drug use other than marijuana and 
8th and 10th gra
dany illicit drug use including inhalants are based on one half of the 
N indicated. 12th grade any illicit drug use including inhalants data are 
based on one fo
rm; N is one sixth of

s. See the amphetamine note for details.
bIn 2001 the question text was changed on half of the questionnaire
 forms for each age group. Other psychedelics was changed to

Miltown was replaced with X
anax. For 
8th, 10th, and 12th graders: The 2001 data pres
ented here are based on the changed forms only; 
N is one half of 
N indicated. In 2002 
the remaining forms were changed to the new wording. The dat
a are based on all forms beginning in 2002. Data for any illicit drug other 
than marijuana and data for hallucinogens are also affected by
 these changes and have been handled in a parallel manner.  Hallu
cinogens,LSD, and hallucinogens other than LSD are bas
ed on five of six forms beginning in 2014; 
N is five sixths of 
N indicated.
cFor 12th graders only: Data based on five of six forms in 1991Œ1998;  
N is five sixths of 
N indicated. Data based on three of six forms

N indicated. Data based on two of six 
forms beginning in 2002; 
N is two sixths of 
N indicated. 
hFor 12th graders only: Data based on four of six forms; 
N is four sixths of 
N indicated.
iIn 1995 the heroin question was changed in one of two forms for 8t
h and 10th graders and in three of six forms for 12th graders
. Separate questions were asked for use with and without injecti
on. In 1996, the heroin question was changed in the remaining 8th
- and 10th-grade forms. Data presented here represent the combined data from all forms.
jFor 8th and 10th graders only: Data based on one of two forms in 1995; 
N is one half of

slightly in half of the forms. An examination of the da

not show any effect from the wording change. In 2010 the re

like manner. In 2011 the question te
xt was 
changed slightly in one form; bennies
, Benzedrine and Methadrine were dropped from the 
list of examples. An examination of the

did not show any effect from the wording change. In 2013 the question wording was changed slightly in two of the 8th and 10th g
rade questionnaires and in three of the 12th grade questionnaires. The new
 wording in 2013 asked "On how many occasions (if any) hav
