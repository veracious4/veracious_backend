This is a national tragedy.
 
 
The evidence shows that if Veterans are in the system, receiving care,
 
they are much less likely to take their own lives than Veterans outside 
the system.
 
71
 
 
That is why we 
must 
increase the number of mental health care 
professionals inside the VA 

 
while ensuring that Veterans can access 
private mental health care as well.  
 
 
America must take action to improve mental health 
services for the 
country at large

This includes
 
expand
ing
 
the number of facilities, 
integrating primary care and mental care professionals, reforming 
confinement rules, and making it easier for family members who see 
warning signs to get their l

emergencies.

Clinton's Top Five Email Lies

 
GOP
, 7/5/16
)
 
  
Hillary Clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server 
and to bypass g
overnment security in 
order to keep her emails from 
being read by t
he public and by 
federal officials.
 
96
 
97
 
98
 
 
In other words, she was willing to risk our foreign enemies reading her 
emails as long as the 
voting American public 
could not.
 
99
 
100
 
 
Her conduct 
was willful, intentional, and unlawful 

 
and her repeated 
false statemen
ts about her conduct prove
 
that she was fully aware of 
her guilt.
 
101
 
102
 
103
 
104
 
105
 
 
This was 
not 
just 
extreme carelessness with classified material 

 
which 
is
 
still totally disqualifying.  
Th
is is calculated, deliberate, premeditated 
misconduct 

 
followed by a cover
-
up that included false statements 
and lies to Congress, the media and the American people.
