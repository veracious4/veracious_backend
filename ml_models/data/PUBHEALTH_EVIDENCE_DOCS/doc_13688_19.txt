  	  | CBS Miami, part 2: More questions raised about Patrick Murphy's environmental company »    Marco Rubio's got help from a new super PAC, which is already hitting Patrick Murphy   @PatriciaMazzei Friends of Marco Rubio got to work quickly creating a new super PAC to back the Florida Republican's Senate re-election campaign.
 The first order of business: slamming Democrat Patrick Murphy's résumé inflation.
 Florida First Project was born Wednesday, the same day Rubio announced his decision to seek another six-year term.
 It's run by many of the same people who managed Conservative Solutions, the super PAC that assisted Rubio's presidential campaign.
 Others involved in the committee worked for the campaign itself.
 By Thursday, Florida First had released its first web ad, a forceful hit against Murphy, the likely Democratic nominee who had the bad luck of learning of Rubio's re-election bid on the same day that Miami Herald news partner WFOR-CBS 4 published a scathing investigation into Murphy's professional background.
 Murphy's campaign has disputed some of the report's findings.
 "Patrick Murphy lied," the 30-second spot says.
 "He isn't who he says he is."
 Heading Florida First Project will be Warren Tompkins, also directed Conservative Solutions.
 Two other Conservative Solutions veterans, strategist Mark Harris and spokesman Jeff Sadosky, will serve the same roles as well.
 The PAC will also be advised by longtime Rubio strategist Heath Thompson and pollster Whit Ayres.
 Dorinda Moss, the finance chief of Rubio's presidential campaign, will be the PAC's finance director.
