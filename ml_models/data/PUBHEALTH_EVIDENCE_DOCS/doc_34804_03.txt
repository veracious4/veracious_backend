 Hold your babies.....          dlash1281   Posted 08/04/2010      Over the weekend a one year old little boy that attends my sister and brother in law's church (I attend there as well, but not as active) SOMEHOW.....got ahold of a nail gun, and shot himself in the chest.
 The nail went through the paracardical sac around his heart and stopped inches before hitting his ventricle.
 He went through surgery, was on a vent, and was under some serious sedation.
 Eachday he was showing signs of getting better, even after getting an infection in his blood stream which was found on the nail itself.
 Everyday I have gotten an update, and everyday I countinue to pray.... TODAY.....Hayden is OFF the vent, breathing on his own, and for the first time since this freak accident his mommy has got to hold him....there was nothing else that needed to be said when I seen this picture.....
 Hold your babies.....this was one of those freak accident's but those freak accidents can happen to anyone.

 There have been several accidents in my area this summer where 18month-3 yr old children are getting runover by parents or grandparents.
 It's really sad.
