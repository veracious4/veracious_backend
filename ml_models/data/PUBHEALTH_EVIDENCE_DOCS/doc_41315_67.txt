 Effects on the bladder, in the form of hyperplasia and neoplasms and increased bladder weights, were detected in several studies after oral administration of the substance (Auletta et al.
 1998a, BAYER 1996, Laham et al.
 1984a, 1985, SOCMA 1994a).
 As a result of these pathological findings, a 10‐week mechanistic study of the effects of tributyl phosphate on the rat bladder was carried out.
 This confirmed the effects and provided more detailed information.
 From tributyl phosphate doses of 53 mg/kg body weight and day (700 mg/kg diet), hyperplasia and focal epithelial necrosis with ulceration and acute inflammation of the bladder were found.
 The ulcers were associated with haemorrhage (BAYER 1996).
 In a 2‐year study, the hyperplastic and neoplastic effects on the bladder epithelium developed in a lower dose range or were more pronounced in male rats than in the female animals.
 Hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium was observed from 700 mg/kg diet (doses of about 33 (♂) and 42 (♀) mg/kg body weight and day).
 The NOAEL in this study was found to be 200 mg/kg diet, about 9 (♂) and 12 (♀) mg/kg body weight and day (Auletta et al.
 1998a, SOCMA 1994a).
 The liver is also a target organ.
 In a series of studies with repeated administration of tributyl phosphate to rats, increased liver weights were observed in male animals after lower doses of tributyl phosphate than in female animals (Cascieri et al.
 1985, FMC Corp 1985, Laham et al.
 1984a, 1984b, 1985, Mitomo 1980).
 In male animals, administration of concentrations as low as 8 mg/kg diet (about 0.6 mg/kg body weight), for 13 weeks led to increased relative liver weights; this was regarded, however, as an adaptive, not an adverse effect, particularly as histopathological examination did not reveal any changes.
 The NOAEL found in this study was 200 mg/kg diet (15 mg/kg body weight and day).
 From 1000 mg/kg diet (about 75 mg/kg body weight and day), the absolute liver weights were increased and an increase was found in the liver‐specific parameter γ‐glutamyl transpeptidase in serum.
 An increase in other liver‐specific parameters in serum (alanine aminotransferase, cholesterol, partial thromboplastin time, bilirubin) was observed at about 5000 mg/kg diet (375 mg/kg body weight and day) (Cascieri et al.
 1985, FMC Corp 1985).
 In rats given tributyl phosphate with the diet for 105 weeks, a slight but not statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas was seen.
 Organ weights and biochemical parameters, in particular liver enzymes in plasma, were not determined in this long‐term study and can therefore not be used to clarify the effects on the liver caused by tributyl phosphate (Auletta et al.
 1998a, SOCMA 1994a).
 The tubular degeneration and increased kidney weights observed in medium‐term studies in animals given tributyl phosphate concentrations of 5000 mg/kg diet (about 375 mg/kg body weight and day) (Cascieri et al.
 1985, FMC Corp 1985), indicate that the kidney is another target organ; this is supported by changes in parameters of kidney function.
 From tributyl phosphate concentrations of 3000 mg/kg diet (230 mg/kg body weight and day), a decrease in osmolarity and the level of creatinine in urine was detected (Arnold et al.
 1997, BAYER 1996).
 From concentrations of 10000 mg/kg diet (about 750 mg/kg body weight and day), increased blood urea values were observed (Mitomo 1980).
 In addition, at the highest tributyl phosphate doses administered, changed organ weights were found in rats.
 The brain and testis weights were increased, and the spleen, uterus and heart weights reduced (see Table 3).
 Mouse In the mouse the liver was found to be the main target organ.
 The first effects observed were increased liver weights.
 The 18‐month carcinogenicity study (Auletta et al.
 1998b, SOCMA 1994b) revealed a slight increase in liver weights, which was not statistically significant even at the lowest tributyl phosphate concentration of 150 mg/kg diet (about 29 (♂) and 24 (♀) mg/kg body weight and day) (NOAEL).
 At the next highest concentration of 1000 mg/kg diet (about 169 (♂) and 206 (♀) mg/kg body weight and day), the increase in liver weights was statistically significant.
 In a 13‐week study (SOCMA 1991a) the absolute and relative liver weights were significantly increased in mice of both sexes from tributyl phosphate concentrations of 2000 mg/kg diet (300 mg/kg body weight and day).
 Histological examination revealed in this 13‐week study (SOCMA 1991a) centrilobular hypertrophy of the liver (from 2000 mg/kg diet, about 300 mg/kg body weight and day) and in the 18‐month study (Auletta et al.
 1998b, SOCMA 1994b) eosinophilic hepatocellular changes (from 3500 mg/kg diet, about 640 mg/kg body weight and day); the liver cell hypertrophy was more pronounced in the male animals than in the female animals.
 In addition, liver‐specific parameters were significantly increased (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase) (SOCMA 1991a).
 Administration of the substance for 18 months led to a dose‐dependent increase in the incidence of liver cell adenomas in male animals and to a lesser extent also in female animals; this increase was significant in male animals at the highest dose (see Table 4).
 Biochemical parameters, in particular liver enzymes in plasma, were not investigated in this long‐term study with the mouse and so cannot be used to clarify the effects on the liver caused by tributyl phosphate (Auletta et al.
 1998b, SOCMA 1994b).
