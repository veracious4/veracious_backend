Is anyone else faced with the coupons just sitting there because they can’t afford even basic expenses like food, bathing items, and housing?
 Wouldn’t it have been so much more touching to have the GMs or someone make bags of gratis for us as care packages and done porch drops or ship them to us all?14 commentssharesavehidereport80% UpvotedThis thread is archivedNew comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be castSort bybest  level 120 points · 6 months agoI’m grateful, but the timing was so odd to me.
 It would’ve made more sense to send them out to us right after the stores closed, when we still had an income.
 Why after they furlough us?
 Just bad timing.level 116 points · 6 months agoYeah, I used one of my employee discount coupons to get things I use daily and need, but have no use for the other, sadly.
 As much as I want to use it I can’t afford anything.
 And I live in bumfuck Florida where the unemployment system is just a complete joke.
 These are crazy times.level 2Beauty Advisor3 points · 6 months agoHas there been more than one that has gone out?
 Anyone else hoping some people don’t return to work with us?
 I sure can.
 My psm is a hoarder of all the gratis, but that’s just good ol backward Indiana for you.level 19 points · 6 months agoGratis would be amazing!
 But unfortunately it’s in the store and not allowed to enter.
 The brand reps not GM’s, usually are the ones that give gratis to be distribute.level 14 points · 6 months ago · edited 6 months agoI’m there with ya.
 I fortunately have my bills secured for now, but Texas unemployment site hasn’t given me any updates, so I won’t use the coupon.
 I don’t necessarily not appreciate the coupon, but it doesn’t feel helpful at all.Edit: with that being said, I’m thankful that ulta has made most of the decisions that they have in comparison to other corporations.level 12 points · 6 months agoYeah, it would have been one thing if we got a coupon on top of our normal discount but this is nothing special.
 They are just hurting for sales.
 I like my job at Ulta but I know what's what.
 I won't use it.level 12 points · 6 months agoIt's just another way for ulta to get money from us.
 I know it seems awesome for people but this is a business and they want to make sure we're still spending.
 Why do you think we don't get this when the stores open?level 11 point · 6 months agoIf anyone has coupons that they're not going to use, I'd love to take one (if non-employees can use them.)
 It would be super helpful with buying mother's day gifts.Sending love to everyone furloughed.
 I found out recently that my company was letting us all go (not Ulta) so I totally feel your pain.hugs to everyone.level 10 points · 6 months agoI am really sorry you guys: how much were the coupons?
