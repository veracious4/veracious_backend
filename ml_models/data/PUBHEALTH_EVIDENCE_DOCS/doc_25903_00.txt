 "Agenda 21" was a nonbinding UN resolution signed in 1992 that provides an action plan for governments with regard to sustainable development.But in the 22 years since it was signed, extremists have recast it as a secret plot to impose a totalitarian world government and a nefarious effort to crush freedom in the name of environmentalism, according to a 2014 report by the Southern Poverty Law Center.“Fears are running rampant in the far right that [the coronavirus] is some part of a conspiracy, maybe by the Chinese government, other global actors, even George Soros, to do 'something' to conservatives or Americans,” Heidi Beirich, one of the authors of the 2014 report, told BuzzFeed News.“It’s not surprising that Agenda 21 would pop up again in that environment.”Agenda 21 content is rife on YouTube, which has long had an issue with conspiracy theories.One YouTube video, which has been viewed more than 200,000 times since being uploaded by "the Atlantis Report" stated: “Agenda 21 will reduce the human population from almost 8 billion to around 750 million.
 Some other videos were removed after being flagged.Another post, shared several hundred times on Facebook via a page called "United States of Africa," claims the coronavirus is part of a Western biological plot to force vaccinations that would systematically reduce the population of Africa.
 Agenda 21 as erosive of American sovereignty,” and legislators in several states have introduced anti–Agenda 21 bills in the years since.However, much of the recent online conversation about Agenda 21 and the coronavirus goes far beyond legitimate criticism of Big Government and environmental overreach and into the world of outlandish conspiracy.“It’s no surprise to see a reemergence of this decades-old theory, which our research has found to be flourishing across social media,” said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a think tank.
 "This is incredibly dangerous in the context of a global pandemic, as conspiracies almost always urge people to doubt the official advice from government and the NHS, for example, to reject an eventual vaccine or social distancing rules, putting themselves and the rest of society at risk.
 "Many of the biggest posts citing Agenda 21 are posted in languages other than English.One video in Tamil linking the resolution to “forced vaccinations” has more than 600,000 views.
 Facebook posts in Spanish and Hungarian also have thousands of shares.
