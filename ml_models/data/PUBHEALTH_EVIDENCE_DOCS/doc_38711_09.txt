 The Truth: Contrary to rumors, Mark Zuckerberg still isn’t giving Facebook stock to random people who share a message on the social media site.
 False reports of that Mark Zuckerberg would give 10% of his Facebook stock to 1,000 random users surfaced in early December 2015.
 TruthorFiction.com reported on those claims and easily proved them to be false.
 One version of the rumor claimed that ABC’s “Good Morning America” had confirmed that this time the Facebook stock giveaway was not a hoax.
 That’s false.
 The show has never reported on the Facebook stock giveaway scam, so that claim is completely fabricated.
 Then, an article that appeared on the fake news website the Abodo Chronicles reported that Mark Zuckerberg had partnered with the online publication to “give away $4.5 million each to $1,000 Facebook users.” The (fake) story goes that Zuckerberg was tired of the Facebook stock giveaway rumors, so he decided to make them a reality:MENLO PARK, California (The Adobo Chronicles) – Mark Zuckerberg is tired of the hoax that has been circulating on Facebook, asking users to share a supposed message that the Facebook founder is giving away $4.5 Million to 1,000 people.Well, if you can’t lick ’em, join ’em.
 That’s what Zuckerberg is doing exactly.Today, Zuckerberg announced that he is partnering with Silicon Valley-based The Adobo Chronicles  to make the hoax a reality.Again the story encourages readers to “share” a message on Facebook to become eligible for the massive Facebook giveaway.
 However, the Abodo Chronicles isn’t a trusted source of news, according to its “About Us” page:THE ADOBO CHRONICLES  is your source of up-to-date, unbelievable news.
 Everything you read on this site is based on fact, except for the lies.Anytime that you learn about Facebook changing policies (or giving away stock) from a contact who “shares” a post, it’s a hoax.
