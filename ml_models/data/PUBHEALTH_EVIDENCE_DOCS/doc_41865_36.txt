 Not getting enough sleep is linked with many chronic diseases and conditions—such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and depression—that threaten our nation’s health.
 Not getting enough sleep can lead to motor vehicle crashes and mistakes at work, which cause a lot of injury and disability each year.
 Getting enough sleep is not a luxury—it is something people need for good health.
 Sleep disorders can also increase a person’s risk of health problems.
 However, these disorders can be diagnosed and treated, bringing relief to those who suffer from them.
