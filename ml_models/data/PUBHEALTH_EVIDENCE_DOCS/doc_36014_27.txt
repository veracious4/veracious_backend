“Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn’t care about American Workers!”The claim was immediately debunked by New York Times reporter Jack Nicas.“President Trump just toured a Texas plant that has been making Apple computers since 2013 and took credit for it, suggesting the plant opened today,” Nicas wrote.
 “‘Today is a very special day.’ Tim Cook spoke immediately after him and did not correct the record.”While Cook did not address the lie, his own Twitter account confirms that the plant — which specializes in making his company’s Macbook Pro model — opened in 2013:As CNBC and other organizations have reported, the plant itself is not even owned by Apple; it is owned by a separate contractor named Flex.
 It also noted:Apple has been playing a calculated game with the Trump administration for years, with Cook personally wooing the president on several occasions.
 That charm offensive culminated with Cook touring Flex’s Austin factory.
 It was a rare political moment for Apple as it willingly played a part in a PR stunt for an administration that runs counter to many of its values, from the environment to immigration policy.But that’s a cost Apple seems willing to pay in order to get what it really wants: a tariff exemption on its most important and profitable product, the iPhone.
