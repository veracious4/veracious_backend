1 INDICATIONS AND US
AGE 
SYNDROS 
is indicated 
in adults for the treatment of: 
anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with 
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
(AIDS
); and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond 
adequately to 
conventional antiemetic treatments. 
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINIS
TRATION 
2.1 Important Administration Instructions 
Always use the enclosed calibrated oral dosing 
syringe 
when administering 
SYNDROS 
to ensure the 
dose is measured and administered accurately. 
The ca
librated oral syringe measures a maximum SYNDROS dose of 5 mg. If the prescribed dose is 
greater than 5 mg, the total dose will need to be divided and drawn up in two or more portions using 
the oral syringe. 
Take 
each dose of 
SYNDROS with a full glass of 
water (6 
to 8 ounces). 
For information on dosing SYNDROS with regard to meals, 
see 
Dosage and Administration 2.2 and 
2.3. 2.2 Anorexia Associated with Weight Loss in 
Adult P
atients with AIDS 
Adults Starting Dosage 
The recommended 
adult 
starting 
dosage of 
SYNDROS 
is 2.1 mg orally twice daily, 
one hour before 
lunch and 
one hour before 
dinner. 
In elderly patients, consider initiating 
SYNDROS 
at 2.1 mg once daily one hour before 
dinner or at bedtime to 
reduce the risk of 
central nervous system (
CNS
) symptoms 
[see 
Use in Specific Populations (
8.5)]. 
Dosing later in the day may 
reduce the frequency 
of Central Nervous System (CNS) adverse reactions
. CNS 
adverse reactions are 
dose
-related 
[see 
Warnings and Precautions (
5.1)]; therefore monitor patients and reduce 
the dosage as needed. 
If CNS 
adverse reactions 
of feeling high, dizziness, confusion, 
and 
somnolence occur, 
they usually resolve in 1 to 3 days and usually do not require dosage reduction. 
If CNS 
adverse reactions 
are 
severe or persistent, reduce the dose to 
2.1 mg 
once daily 
one hour 
before 
dinn
er or in the evening 
at bedtime
. Dosage Titration 
If tolerated and 
further therapeutic effect is desired, 
the dosage may be increased gradually 
to 2.1 mg one hour 
before 
lunch and 
4.2 mg one hour 
before 
dinner. 
Increase the dose of SYNDROS gradually in 
order to reduce the frequency of dose
-related adverse reactions 
[see 
Warnings and Precautions (
5.1)]. Most patients respond to 
2.1 mg twice daily, but t
he dose may be 
further increased to 
4.2 mg one hour 
before lunch and 
4.2 mg 
one hour 
before 
dinner, 
as tolerated to achieve a therapeutic effect. 
Maximum Dosage: 
8.4 mg twice daily
. 3Reference ID: 3954181                                                  
                                                          2.3 Nausea and Vomiting Associated with 
Cancer 
Chemotherapy in 
Adult P
atients Who 
Failed 
Conventional Antiemetics 
Adults Starting Dosage 
The recommended starting dosage of 
SYNDROS 
is 4.2 mg/m
2 orally administered 
1 to 3 hours prior to 
chemotherapy 
and 
then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy for a total of 4 to 6 doses 
per 
day. 
Calcu
late the starting dose by following the steps below: 
oStarting dose (mg) = Patient 
body surface area (
BSA
) in m 2 multiplied by 
4.2 mg/m
2 oRound dose to the nearest 0.1 mg increment 
oTo correspond with the calibrated oral dosing syringe, the dose may need to 
be rounded to the 
nearest 0.1 mL increment 
In elderly patients, consider initiating 
SYNDROS 
at 2.1 mg/m2 once daily 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy to 
reduce the risk of CNS symptoms 
[see 
Use in Specific Populations (
8.5)]. 
Because food delays the absor
ption of SYNDROS
, administer the first dose on an empty stomach at least 30 
minutes before eating. 
Subsequent doses can be taken without regard to meals. 
Because food can substantially change the systemic exposure to dronabinol and its active metabolite, 
the timing 
of dosing in relation to meal times should be kept consistent for each chemotherapy cycle, once the dosage has 
been determined from the titration process. 
Dosage Titration 
The dosage can be 
titrated to clinical response during a chemotherapy 
cycle or subsequent cycles, based 
upon initial effect
, as tolerated to achieve a clinical effect, in increments of 
2.1 mg/m
2 . Maximum 
Dosage: 
12.6 mg/m
2 per dose 
for 4 to 6 doses per day
. Adverse reactions are dose
-related and psychiatric symptoms inc
rease significantly at the maximum 
dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (
5.1)]. Monitor patients 
for adverse reactions 
and consider decreasing the dose to 
2.1 mg once daily 
1 to 3 hours prior 
to chemotherapy to 
reduce the risk of CNS adverse reactions

                                        5 WARNINGS AND PRECA
UTIONS 
5.1 Neurological Adverse Reactions 
Psychiatric Adverse Reactions 
Dronabinol has been reported to exacerbate mania, depression, or schizophrenia. Prior to initiating treatment 
with SYNDROS, screen patients for a history of these illnesses.  Avoid use in patien
ts with a psychiatric history 
or, if the drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during 
treatment. 
Also, avoid concomitant use with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. 
Cognitive Adve
rse Reactions 
Use of SYNDROS has been associated with cognitive impairment and altered mental state.  Reduce the dose of 
SYNDROS or discontinue use of SYNDROS if signs or symptoms of 
cognitive impairment develop. 
Elderly 
and pediatric patients may be more 
sensitive to the neurological and psychoactive effects of SYNDROS 
[see Use in Specific Populations (
8.4, 8.5)]. Hazardous Activities 
SYNDROS can cause and may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of 
hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. Concomitant use of 
other drugs that 
cause dizziness, confus
ion, sedation
, or somnolence such as CNS depressants may increase this effect (e.g., 
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, lithium, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, 
and muscle 
relaxants). 
Inform 
patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reas
onably certain that 
SYNDROS does not affect them adversely. 
5.2 Hemodynamic Instability 
Patients may experience occasional hypotension, possible hypertension, syncope, or tachycardia wh
ile taking SYNDROS 
[see Clinical Pharmacology 
(12.2)]. Patients with cardiac disorders may be at higher risk. 
Avoid concomitant use of other drugs that are also associated with similar cardiac effects (e.g., amphetamines, other 
sympathomimetic agents, 
atropine, amoxapine, 
antihistamines, 
other anticholinergic 
agents, 
amitriptyline, 
desipramine, other 
tricyclic antidepressant
s). Monitor patients for changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and 
syncope after initiating or 
increasin
g the dosage of SYNDROS. 
5.3 Interaction with Disulfiram and Metronidazole 
SYNDROS 
contains 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol and 5
.5% (w/w) propylene glycol. 
Use of SYNDROS may 
cause a disulfiram
-like reaction, characterized by abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing, 
in patients receiving disulfiram or other drugs that 
produce this reaction (e.g., metronidazole). 
Discontinue 
products containing disulfiram or metronidazole at least 14 days before starting treatment with SYNDROS 
and 
do not administer 
these products 
within 7 days of completing treatment with SYNDROS 
[see C
ontraindications 
(4), Drug Interactions (
7.3
)]. When administered concomitantly with propylene glycol, ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of 
propylene glycol, which may lead to elevated concentrations of propylene glycol.  However, 
the contribution of 
propylene glycol, if any, to the interaction between disulfiram and SYNDROS is unknown. 
5.4 Seizures 
Seizures and seizure
-like activity have been reported in patients receiving dronabinol. 
Weigh this potential risk against the benefits bef
ore prescribing SYNDROS to patients with a history of 
seizures, including those receiving anti
-epileptic medication or with other factors that can lower the seizure 
5Reference ID: 3954181                                                                        
  threshold.  Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure contr
ol during SYNDROS 
therapy. 
If 
a seizure 
occur
s, a
dvise patients to discontinue SYNDROS and contact a healthcare provider immediately. 
5.5 Multiple 
Substance Abuse 
Patients with a history of substance abus
e or dependence, 
including 
marijuana or 
alcohol
, may be more 
likely 
to abuse SYNDROS as well.  SYNDROS contains 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol.  

history of substance abuse during treatment with SYNDROS 
for the development of these behaviors or 
conditions. 
5.6 Paradoxical Nausea, Vomiting, or Abdominal Pain 
New or worsening nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain can occur during treatment with synthetic delta
-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (delta
-9-THC), the active ingredient in SYNDROS.  In some cases, these adverse 
reactions 
were severe (e.g., dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities) and required 
dose reduction or drug 
discontinuation.  Symptoms are similar to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), 
which is described as 
cyclical events of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting in chronic, long
-term users of delta
-9-THC products. 
Because patients may not recognize these symptoms as abnormal
, it is important to specifically ask patients or 
their caregiv
ers about the development of worsening of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain while 
being treated 
with SYNDROS
. Consider dose reduction or discontinuing SYNDROS if a patient develops worsening nausea, 
vomiting, or abdominal pain while 
on treatment
. 5.7 Toxicity in Preterm Neonates 
SYNDROS contains the excip
ients dehydrated alcohol (50%, w/w) and propylene glycol (5
.5%, w/w).  When 
administered concomitantly with propylene glycol, ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene 
glycol, which may 
lead to elevated concentrations 
of propylene glycol
. Preterm neonates may be at increased 
risk of propylene glycol
-associated adverse 
reactions 
due to 
a diminished ability to metabolize propylene 
glycol, thereby, leading to accumulation 
The safety and ef
fectiveness of SYNDROS have not been established in pediatric patients.  
Avoid SYNDROS 
in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible 
propylene glycol
-associated 
toxicities 
including:  hyperosmolarity, with or without lactic acid
osis, renal toxicity, CNS depression (including stupor, 
coma, and apnea), seizures, hypotonia, cardiac arrhythmias, and electrocardiogram (EEG) changes, and 
hemolysis. 
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 
6.1 Clinical Trials Experience 
Because clinical trials are conducte
d under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the 
clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not 
reflect the rates observed in practice.  
The following serious adve
rse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling.

ated weight loss included 157 patients receiving dronabinol 
capsules and 67 receiving placebo. 
Studies of 
nausea and vomiting related to cancer chemotherapy included 317 patients receiving dronabinol capsules and 68 
receiving placebo. 
In the tables below is a 
summar
y of the adverse reactions in 474 patients exposed to 
dronabinol capsules in studies
. Studies of different durations were combined by considering the first occurrence of 
adverse reactions 
during the 
first 28 days.

formulation of 
dronabinol.  Because the
se reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not 
always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

[see Warnings and Precautions 
(5.2)]. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 
7.1 Disulfiram and Metronidazole 
SYNDROS contains 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol 5.5% (w/w) propylene glycol, which can produce 
disulfiram
-like reactions when co
-administered with disulfiram or other drugs that produce this reaction (e.g., 
metronidazole). 
Discontinue products containing dis
ulfiram or metronidazole at least 
14 days before 
starting 
treatment with SYNDROS 
and d
o not administer 
these products 
within 
7 days 
of completing treatment with 
SYNDROS 
[see Contraindications (
4), Warnings and Precautions (
5.3)]. When administered concomit
antly with propylene glycol, ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of 
propylene glycol, which may lead to elevated concentrations 
of propylene gl
ycol
. However, 
the contribution of 
propylene glycol, if any, to the interaction between disulfiram and 
SYNDROS is unknown. 
7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on Dronabinol 
Dronabinol is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes. 
Inhibitors of these enzymes may 
increase, while inducers may decrease, the systemic exposure of dronabinol and/or its active met
abolite 
resulting in an increase in dronabinol
-related adverse reactions or loss of efficacy of SYNDROS. 
Monitor for increased 
dronabinol
-related 
adverse reactions when SYNDROS is co
-administered with inhibitors 
of CYP2C9 (e.g.
, amiodarone, fluconazole) an
d inhibitors of CYP3A4 enzymes (e.g.
, ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, 
erythromycin, grapefruit 
juice). 
7.3 Highly Protein
-Bound Drugs 
Dronabinol is highly bound to plasma proteins, and therefore, might displace 
and increase the fr
ee fraction of 
other concomitantly administered 
protein
-bound drugs
. Although this displacement has not been confirmed in 
vivo, monitor patients for 
increased adverse reactions to narrow therapeutic index drugs (e.g., warfarin, 
cyclosporine, amphotericin 
B) when initiating treatment or increasing the dosage of SYNDROS
. 8Reference ID: 3954181          
                                                  8 USE IN SPECIFIC PO
PULATIONS 
8.1 Pregnancy 
Risk Summary 
SYNDROS, a synthetic cannabinoid containing alcohol, may cause fetal harm.  
Avoid use of SYNDROS in 
pregnant women.  Although there 
is little published data on the use of synthetic cannabinoids during pregnancy, 
use of cannabis (e.g., marijuana) and use of alcohol during pregnancy have been associated with adverse 
fetal/neonatal outcomes 
[see Clinical Considerations
]. Cannabinoids ha
ve been found in the umbilical cord 
blood from pregnant women who smoke cannabis.  In animal reproduction studies, 
no teratogenicity was 
reported in mice administered dronabinol at up to 
30 times the MRHD 
(maximum recommended human doses) 
and up to 
5 times 
the MRHD for patients with 
AIDS and 
cancer, respectively. 
Similar findings were reported in 
pregnant rats administered dronabinol at up to 
5 to 20 times the MRHD and 
3 times the MRHD 
for patients with 
AIDS and cancer, respectively.  
Decreased maternal we
ight gain and number of viable pups and increased fetal 
mortality and early resorptions were observed in both species at doses which induced maternal toxicity
. In 
published studies, offspring of pregnant rats administered delta
-9-THC during and after orga
nogenesis have 
been reported to exhibit neurotoxicity with adverse effects on brain development, including abnormal neuronal 
connectivity and impairments in cognitive and motor function 
[see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are 
unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage 
in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 
to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 
Clinical Consideration
s Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions 
Published studies suggest that during pregnancy, the use of cannabis, which includes THC, 
whether for 
recreational or medicinal purposes, may increase the risk of 
adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes including fetal 
growth restriction, low birth weight, preterm birth, small
-for-gestational age, admission to the NICU, and 
stillbirth.  Therefore, use of cannabis during pregnancy should be avoided
. SYNDROS contains alcohol.  Published studies have demonstrated that alcohol is associated with fetal harm 
including central nervous system abnormalities, behavioral disorders, and impaired intellectual development.  
Avoid use of SYNDROS in p
regnant women. 
Data 
Human Data 
Delta
-9-THC has been measured in the cord blood of some infants whose mothers reported prenatal use of 
cannabis, suggesting that dronabinol may cross the placenta to the fetus during pregnancy. 
The effects of delta
-9-THC on the fetus are n
ot known. Animal Data The recommended dose ranges for SYNDROS in 
AIDS and 
cancer patients are designed to achieve the same 
systemic exposure ranges as with the recommended dose ranges for dronabinol capsules. 
Therefore, animal to 
human dose multiples, as 
shown below, are based on the MRHDs (maximum recommended human doses) for 
dronabinol capsules, instead of the MRHDs for SYNDROS, which are 15% lower. 
This approach for dose 
comparison between animals and humans is supported by the demonstrated difference 
in dronabinol 
bioavailability between SYNDROS and dronabinol capsules. 
9 Reference ID: 3954181                                                                            Reproduction studies with dronabinol have been performed in mice at 15 to 450 mg/m
2, equivalent to 1 to 30 
times 
the MRHD of 15 mg/m
2/day 
(dronabinol capsules) 
in AIDS patients 
or 0.2 t
o 5 times the MRHD of 90 
mg/m
2/day (dronabinol capsules) in cancer patients
, and in rats at 74 to 295 mg/m
2 (equivalent to 
5 to 20 times 
the MRHD of 15 mg/m
2/day in AIDS patients or 
0.8 to 3 times 
the MRHD of 90 mg/m
2/day 
in cancer patients). 
These studie
s have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity due to dronabinol. 
At these dosages in mice and rats, 
dronabinol decreased maternal weight gain and number of viable pups and increased fetal mortality and early 
resorptions. 
Such effects were dose dependent 
and less apparent at lower doses 
that produced less maternal 
toxicity. 
Review of published literature indicates that the endocannabinoid system plays a role in neurodevelopmental 
processes such as neurogenesis, migration, and synaptogenesis.  Exposure of 
pregnant 
rats to 
delta
-9-THC (during and after organogenesis) 
may modulate these 
processes 
to result in abnormal patterns of neuronal 
connectivity 
and subsequent cognitive impairments 
in the offspring
. Nonclinical toxicity studies in pregnant 
rats 
and 
new
born pups 
have shown prenatal exposure to THC 
that resulted in impairment of motor function, 
alteration in synaptic activity, and interference in cortical projection of neuron development 
in the offspring
. Prenatal exposure has shown effects on cognitive 
function such as learning, short
-and long
-term memory, 
attention, decreased ability to remember task, and ability to discriminate between novel and same objects.  
Overall, prenatal exposure to THC has resulted in significant and long
-term 
changes in 
brain 
development, 
cogniti
on, and behavior in rat offspring
. 8.2 Lactation 
For mothers infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention recommend not to breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV. 
Because 
of the potential for HIV transmission in bre
astfed infants, advise women infected with HIV not to breastfeed 
while taking SYNDROS. 
For mothers with nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, there are limited data on the 
presence of dronabinol in human milk, the effects on the breastfe
d infant, or the effects on milk production. 
The reported effects of inhaled cannabis transferred to the breastfeeding infant have been inconsistent and 
insufficient to establish causality. 
Because of the possible adverse effects from SYNDROS on the brea
stfeeding 
infant, advise women with nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy not to breastfeed during 
treatment with SYNDROS and for 
9 days after the final dose. 
8.4 Pediatric Use 
The safety and effectiveness of 
SYNDROS 
have not been establi
shed in pediatric patients. 
Pediatric patients may be more sensitive to neurological and psychoactive effects of SYNDROS 
[see Warnings 
and Precautions (
5.1)]. SYNDROS contains the excipients 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol and 5.5% (w/w) 
propylene glycol
. E
thanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene glycol, which may lead to 
elevated concentrations 
of propylene glycol
. Preterm neonates may be at increased risk of propylene glycol
-associated adverse events due to diminished ability to metaboliz
e propylene glycol, thereby, leading to 
accumulation 
[see Warnings and 
Precautions (
5.7)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use 
Clinical studies of dronabinol capsules in AIDS and cancer patients did not include sufficient numbers of 
subjects aged 65 and over to determine w
hether they respond differently from younger subjects. 
Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the neurological, psychoactive, and postural hypotensive effects of 
SYNDROS 
[see Warnings and Precautions (
5.1, 5.2)].

increased risk for falls as a result of their underlying disease state
, which 
may be exacerbated by the 
CNS 
effects of somnolence and dizziness associated with 
SYNDROS 
[see Warnings 
and Precautions (
5.1)]. These patients should be monitored closely and placed on fall precautions prior to 
initiating 
SYNDROS 
therapy
. In antiemetic studies, no difference in efficacy was apparent in patients 
greater 
than 55 years 
of age 
compared to younger patients
. In general
, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious
, usually starting at the low end of the dosing 
range, reflecting the greater frequency of falls, decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, increased 
sensitivity to psychoactive effects
, and of 
concomitant disease or other drug therapy 
[see Dosage and 
Administration (
2.2, 2.3)]. 
8.6 Effect of CYP2C9 Polymorphism 
Published data suggest that systemic clearance of dronabinol may be reduced and concentrations may be 
increased in presence of CYP2C9 
genetic polymorphism. 
Monitoring for increased adverse reactions is 
recommended in patients known to carry genetic variants associated with diminished CYP2C9 function 
[see Clinical Pharmacology (
12.5)]. 
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEP
ENDENCE 
9.1 Controlled Substance 
SYNDROS 
is controlled in Schedule X of the Controlled Substances Act
. 9.2 Abuse 
SYNDROS contains dronabinol, the main psychoactive component in marijuana.  Ingestion of high doses of 
dronabinol increases the risk of psychiatric adverse 
reactions 
if abused 
or misused
, while continued 
administration can lead to addiction.  Psychiatric adverse 
reactions 
may include psychosis, hallucinations, 
depersonalization, mood alteration, and paranoia.  
In vitro 
studies demonstrate that SYNDROS can be easily and effecti
vely abused without manipulation.  
SYNDROS contains 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol 
[see Warning and Precautions (
5.5)]. 
In a randomized, 
single
-dose
, double-blind, placebo
-and active
-controlled crossover pharmacodynamic study 
of 43 experienced marijuana 

placebo and dronabinol in sesame oil oral capsules. Treatment arms were 10 mg and 30 mg dronabinol 
capsules, 10 mg and 30 mg dronabinol from SYNDROS, and placebo oral solution and ca

drug 
l
dose, compared with the 10 mg dose, for both SYNDROS and 
dronabinol
-containing capsules.  Overall, the pharmacodynamic results from this study demonstrated no 
statistically significant diff
erences in various measures of drug liking for the doses taken, though the 
SYNDROS results were consistently greater than those of 
dronabinol 
capsules.  Similarly, observed adverse 
reactions 
were greater for SYNDROS. 
The pharmacodynamic and safety effects 
of SYNDROS following 
multiple doses ha
ve not been evaluated. 
Patients should be instructed to keep SYNDROS in a secure place out of reach of others for whom the 
medication has not been prescribed. 
9.3 Dependence 
Physical dependence is a state that develops 
as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug 
use. 
Physical dependence manifests by drug class
-specific withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or 
a significant dose reduction of a drug. 
The appearance of a withdrawal sy
ndrome when administration of the 
11Reference ID: 3954181                                                 
                drug is terminated is the only actual evidence of physical dependence.  Physical dependence can develop during 
chronic therapy with SYNDROS, and develops after chronic abuse of marijuana. 
A withdrawal syndrome was reporte
d after the abrupt 
discontinuation 
of dronabinol capsules in 
subjects 
receiving dosages of 210 mg 
per 
day for 12 to 16 
consecutive 
days.  Within 12 hours after discontinuation, 
subjects 
manifested symptoms such as irritability, insomnia, and restlessness. 
By approximately 24 hours post
dronabinol 
discontinuation

loose stools, hiccoughs, and anorexia. 
These withdrawal symptoms gradually dissipated over the next 48 hours.  
Patie
nts also complained of disturbed sleep for several weeks after discontinuing therapy. 
10 OVERDOSAGE 
SYNDROS contains 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol and 5
.5% (w/w) propylene glycol. 
Ingestion of the product 
over the recommended dose could result in significant toxicity. 
Dronabinol 
Signs and symptoms 
of dronabinol 
overdose 
include drowsiness, euphoria, heightened sensory awareness, 
altered time perception, reddened conjunctiva, dry mo
uth, tachycardia
, memory impairment, depersonalization, 
mood alteration, urinary retention, reduced bowel motility
, decreased motor coordination, lethargy, slurred 
speech, and postural hypotension. 
Patients may 
also 
experience panic reactions 
if they have 
a prior history of 
nervousness or anxiety 
and seizures may occur in patients with existing seizure disorders.  
It is not known if 
dronabinol 
can be removed by dialysis in cases of overdose
. Alcohol 
Signs and symptoms of alcohol 
overdose include changes in mood or behavior, impaired 
judgment 
or social 
functioning and one or more physical signs such as slurred speech, unsteadiness, lack of coordination, increased 
or irregular heart rate, respiratory depression, impaired attention o
r loss of consciousness. 
Propylene Glycol 
Signs and symptoms of acute poisoning occur only in rare circumstances where 
patients ingest 
large amounts of 
propylene glycol over several days.  These include hypoglycemia, severe metabolic acidosis (caused by t
he metabolism into lactic acid), and CNS depression including coma and seizures. 
Management of 
Overdosage 
If over
-exposure 
of SYNDROS 
occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1
-800-222-1222 for current 
information on the management of poisoning or 
overdosage. 
11 DESCRIPTION 
Dronabinol is a cannabinoid designated chemically as (6aR,10aR)
-6a,7,8,10a
-Tetrahydro
-6,6,9-trimethyl
-3pentyl
-6H-dibenzo[b,d]
-pyran
-1-ol. Dronabinol has the following empirical and structural formulas: 
12Reference ID: 3954181                                                                        12 C21H30O2 (molecular weight=314.4
6) Dronabinol is a 
clear colorless to amber oil
. Dronabinol is insoluble in water. It has a pKa of 10.6 and an 
octanol
-water partition coefficient: 6,000:1 at pH 7. 
SYNDROS (dronabinol) 
oral 
solution, 5 
mg/mL is 
a clear
, pale yellow to brown solution. 
Each 
mL of 
SYNDROS contains 
5 mg of dronabinol as an active ingredient and 
the following inactive ingredients:  
50 % (w/w) dehydrated alcohol, 
polyethylene glycol 
400, propylene glycol, sucralose, methyl 
paraben, propyl 
paraben
, butylated hydroxyanisole
, and water
. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG
Y 12.1 Mechanism of Action 
Dronabinol is an orally active cannabinoid which has complex effects on the CNS, including central 
sympathomimetic activity. 
Cannabinoid receptors have been d
iscovered in neural tissues. These receptors may 
play a role in mediating the effects of dronabinol. 
12.2 Pharmacodynamics 
Effects on the Cardiovascular System 
Dronabinol
-induced sympathomimetic activity may result in tachycardia and/or conjunctival inject
ion. Its 
effects on blood pressure are inconsistent, but subjects have experienced orthostatic hypotension and/or syncope 
upon abrupt standing 
[see Warnings and Precautions (
5.2)]. Effects on the Central Nervous System 
Dronabinol also demonstrates reversible effects on appetite, mood, cognition, memory, and perception. 
These 
phenomena appear to be dose
-related, increasing in frequency with higher dosages, and subject to great inter
-patient variability. 
After oral admin
istration, dronabinol 
capsules 
have an onset of action of approximately 0.5 
to 1 hours and peak effect at 2 to 4 hours. Duration of action for psychoactive effects is 4 to 6 hours, but the 
appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol may continue for 24 hours o
r longer after administration. 
Tachyphylaxis and tolerance develop to some of the 
cardiovascular and CNS 
pharmacologic effects of 
dronabinol with chronic use, suggesting an indirect effect on sympathetic neurons. 
In a study of the 
pharmacodynamics of chro
nic dronabinol exposure, healthy male 
subjects 
(N = 12) received 
12 times the 
maximum dose 
for anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS 
of dronabinol capsules in divided 
doses for 16 days. 
An initial tachycardia induced by dronabinol was replaced successively by normal sinus 
rhythm and then bradycardia. A decrease in supine blood pressure, made worse by standing, was also observed 
initially. 
These 
subjects 
developed tolerance to the cardiov
ascular and subjective adverse CNS effects of 
dronabinol within 12 days of treatment initiation. 
13Reference ID: 3954181                                                                 
   
   
                                 
    Tachyphylaxis and tolerance do not 
appear to develop to the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol. In 
clinical 
studies 
of dronabinol capsules in AIDS 
patien
ts, at the recommended dosage, 
the appetite stimulant effect 
was 
sustained for up to five months. 
12.3 Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Dronabinol (delta
-9-THC) is almost completely absorbed (90 to 95%) after single oral doses. Due to the 
combined effects of 
first pass hepatic metabolism and high lipid solubility, only 10 to 20% of the administered 
dose reaches the systemic circulation. 
Relative bioavailability data from h
ealthy male and female 
subjects 
suggest that 
a dose of 4.2 mg of SYNDROS provides compar
able systemic exposure (C
max and AUC) to a 5 mg 
dronabinol capsule, under fasted conditions 
[see Dosage and Administration (
2.1)]. The c
oncentrations of both 
dronabinol and its major active metabolite (11
-hydroxy
-delta
-9-THC) peak at approximately 0.5 to 
4 hours after 
oral dosing with SYNDROS and decline over several days. 
The mean inter
-and intra
-subject variability in 
dronabinol pharmacokinetics (C
max and AUC
inf
) was approximately 
66% and 
47% and 
67% and 
14%, 
respectively, following administration of SYNDROS 
to healthy subjects.

Food Effect: 
The effect of food on 
the pharmacokinetics of SYNDROS was studied by c
oncomitant dosing of 
SYNDROS with a high
-fat 
(59 grams of 
fat, approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal)
, high 
calorie meal 
(approximately 950 calories).  An appreciable food effect was observed
: food resulted in 
approximately a 2.5
-fold increase in total exposure (AUC
inf
) and approximately a 
5 hour delay in 
median 
Tmax. Food also 
decreased Cmax by approximately 20% 
[see Dosage and Administration (
2.2, 2.3)]). 
Distribution: 
Dronabinol has an ap
parent volume of distribution of approximately 10 L/kg, because of its lipid solubility. 
The plasma protein binding of dronabinol and its metabolites is approximately 97% 
[see Drug Interactions 
(7.3)]. Elimination 
The pharmacokinetics 
of dronabinol can be described using a two compartment model with an initial (alpha) 
half
-life of about 5 hours and a terminal (beta) half
-life of 25 to 36 hours. 
Values for clearance average about 
0.2 L/kg
-hr; but are highly variable due to the complexi
ty of cannabinoid distribution. 
Metabolism 
Dronabinol undergoes extensive first
-pass hepatic metabolism, primarily by hydroxylation, yielding both active 
and inactive metabolites. 
The major metabolite (11
-hydroxy
-delta
-9-THC) is pharmacologically active. 
Published 
in vitro 
data 
indicates that CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 are the primary enzymes in the metabolism of 
14Reference ID: 3954181                                                                          
   13 dronabinol. CYP2C9 appears to be the enzyme responsible for the formation of t
he pri
mary 
active metabolite 
[see Clinical Pharmacol
ogy (12.5)]. Excretion 
Dronabinol and its biotransformation products are excreted in both feces and urine. 
Biliary excretion is the 
major route of 
excretion 
with about half of a radio
-labeled oral dose being recovered from the feces within 72 
hours as contrasted with 10 to 15% recovered from urine. Less than 5% of an oral dose is recovered unchanged 
in the feces. 
Due to its re
-distribution, dronabinol and its 
metabolites may be excreted for prolonged periods of time. 
Following single dose administration, dronabinol metabolites have been detected for more than 5 weeks in the 
urine and feces. 
In a study of dronabinol capsules involving AIDS patients, urinary ca
nnabinoid/creatinine concentration ratios 
were studied bi
-weekly over a six week period. 
The urinary cannabinoid/creatinine ratio was closely correlated 
with dose. 
No increase in the cannabinoid/creatinine ratio was observed after the first two weeks of 
treatment, 
indicating that steady
-state cannabinoid levels had been reached. 
This conclusion is consistent with predictions 
based on the observed terminal half
-life of dronabinol. 
Drug Interaction Studies 
Formal drug
-drug interaction studies have not been 
conducted with 
dronabinol
. The enzyme inhibition and induction potential of dronabinol and its active metabolite are not completely 
understood. 
Published data showed an increase in the elimination half
-life of pentobarbital by 4 hours when concomitantly 
dosed with dronabinol 
[see Warnings and Precautions (
5.1)]. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics 
Published data indicate a 2
-to 3-fold higher dronabinol exposu
re in individuals carrying genetic variants 
associated with diminished CYP2C9 function. 
NONCLINICAL TOXIC
OLOGY 
13.1 Carcinogenesis
, Mutagenesis
, Impairment of Fertility 
The recommended dose ranges for SYNDROS in 
AIDS 
and 
cancer 
patients are designed to 
achieve the same 
systemic exposure ranges as with the recommended dose ranges for dronabinol capsules. 
Therefore, the animal to human dose multiples for carcinogenicity studies, as shown below, are based on the 
MRHD (maximum recommended human dose) for dr
onabinol capsules in AIDS patients, instead of the MRHD 
for SYNDROS which is 15% lower. 
This approach for dose comparison between animals and humans is 
supported by the demonstrated difference in dronabinol bioavailability between SYNDROS and dronabinol 
capsules. 
The animal to human dose multiples for the fertility study in rats, as shown below, are based on the 
MRHD for dronabinol capsules in AIDS 
or cancer 
patients. 
In 2
-year carcinogenicity studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats at d
oses up to 50 mg/kg/day 
dronabinol (approximately 20 times the MRHD for dronabinol capsules in AIDS patients on a body surface area 
basis) or in mice at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (approximately 100 times the MRHD for dronabinol capsules in 
AIDS patients on 
a body surface area basis). 
15Reference ID: 3954181                                                                       
                Dronabinol was not genotoxic in the Ames tests, the 
in vitro 
chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster 
ovary cells, and the 
in vivo 
mouse micronucleus test. 
However, 
dronabinol 
produced a weak positive response 
in a sister chromatid exchange test in Chinese hamster ovary cells. 
In a long
-term study (77 days) in rats, oral administration of d
ronabinol at doses of 30 to 150 
mg/m
2, equivalent 
to 2 to 10 times 
the MRHD of 15 mg/m
2/day 
(dronabinol capsules) 
in AIDS patient
s or 0.3 to 1.5 times the 
MRHD of 90 mg/m
2/day (dronabinol capsules) in cancer patients
, reduced ventral prostate, seminal vesicle and 
epididymal weights and caused a decrease in seminal fluid volume. 
Decreases in spermatogenesis, number of 
developing ger
m cells, and number of Leydig cells in the testis were also observed. However, sperm count, 
mating success and testosterone levels were not affected. 
The significance of these animal findings in humans 
is not known. 
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 
The effectiveness 
of SYNDROS 
has been established based on studies of dronabinol capsules for the treatment 
of anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer 
chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequa
tely 
to conventional antiemetic treatments.

What is the most important information I should know about SYNDROS
? SYNDROS can cause serious side effects, 
including: 
 Worsening mental 
(psychiatric) symptoms
. Psychiatric symptoms can worsen in people who have 
mania, depression, 
or schizophrenia 
and who take SYNDROS
. SYNDROS 
taken with 
medicine
s that cause psychiatric symptoms 
can worsen 
psychiatric symptoms. 
Elderly people 
who take SYNDROS may have a greater risk of having psychiatric symptoms. 
Tell your 
doctor if you have new or worsening mood symptoms, including symptoms of mania, 
depression
, or schizophrenia
.  Problems 
thinking clearly. 
Tell your doctor if you have trouble remembering things
, concentrating
, have increased 
sleepiness
, or confusion. 
Elderly 
people may have a greater risk of having problems thinking clearly. 
 Changes in your blood pressure. 
SYNDROS 
may 
increase 
or decrease your blood pressure, especially when you start 
taking SYNDROS or 
when 
your dose is changed. Tell your doctor if you 
have 
signs or symptoms of changes in your blood 
pressure including: 
headache
s, 
vision problems, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, fainting, or a fast heart
beat. 
Elderly people, 
especially those with dementia, 
and 
people with heart problems 
may have an increased risk of changes in blood pressure and 
an increased risk of falls. 
 Interactions with disulfiram or metronidazole
. SYNDROS 
contains alcohol
, which can cause you to have a reaction to 
medicines that contain disulfiram or metronidazole
. You should not use any 
medicine that 
contai
ns 
disulfiram (Antabuse) or 
metronidazole (Pylera, Flagyl, Flagyl ER, Nuvessa, Vandazole) if you take 
SYNDROS. 
You should not 
use 
a medicine that 
conta
ins disulfiram or metronidazole 
for 
at least 
14 days 
before you start taking 
SYNDROS and 
within 
7 days after 
your last dose of 
SYNDROS. 
Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of a reaction to disulfiram or metronidazole 
including: 
stomach
-area 
(abdominal) cramping, nausea, vomiting, headache
, and flushing. 
What is 
SYNDROS
?  SYNDROS is a prescription medicine used in adults to treat: 
o loss of appetite 
(anorexia) 
in people with AIDS (Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome) who have lost weight
. o nausea and vomiting caused by anti
-cancer medicine (chemotherapy) in people whose nausea and vomiting have not 
improved with usual anti
-nausea medicines
. SYNDROS is a controlled substance (C
-X
) because it contains dronabinol 
which 
can be a target for people who abuse 
prescription medicines or street drugs.  Keep your SYNDROS in a safe place to protect it from theft.  Never give your SYNDROS 
to anyone else because it may cause death or harm them.  Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law. 
It is not known if SYNDROS is safe and effective in children. 
Who should not take SYNDROS? 
Do not take SYNDROS if you: 
 had an allergic 
reaction 
to dronabinol
. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction to dronabinol include: swelling of the lips, 
hives, a rash over your whole body, mouth sores, skin burning, flushing, and throat tightness. 
 had an allergic reaction 
to alcohol
.  are us
ing a medicine that contains disulfiram (Antabuse) or metronidazole (Pylera, Flagyl, Flagyl ER, Nuvessa, Vandazole) or 
have taken or received a medicine that contains disulfiram or metronidazole in the last 14 days. 
What should I tell my doctor before taking SYNDROS? 
Before taking SYNDROS, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you:
