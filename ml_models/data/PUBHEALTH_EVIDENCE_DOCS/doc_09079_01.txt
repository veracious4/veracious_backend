 Myelin in the CNS is a specialised extension of the oligodendrocyte plasma membrane and clemastine fumarate can stimulate differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in vitro, in animal models, and in human cells.
 We aimed to analyse the efficacy and safety of clemastine fumarate as a treatment for patients with multiple sclerosis.MethodsWe did this single-centre, 150-day, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (ReBUILD) in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis with chronic demyelinating optic neuropathy on stable immunomodulatory therapy.
 Patients who fulfilled international panel criteria for diagnosis with disease duration of less than 15 years were eligible.
 Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via block randomisation using a random number generator to receive either clemastine fumarate (5·36 mg orally twice daily) for 90 days followed by placebo for 60 days (group 1), or placebo for 90 days followed by clemastine fumarate (5·36 mg orally twice daily) for 60 days (group 2).
 The primary outcome was shortening of P100 latency delay on full-field, pattern-reversal, visual-evoked potentials.
 We analysed by intention to treat.
 All patients completed the study.
 Clemastine fumarate treatment was associated with fatigue, but no serious adverse events were reported.InterpretationTo our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial to document efficacy of a remyelinating drug for the treatment of chronic demyelinating injury in multiple sclerosis.

 2016; 5: e18246Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar We furthermore showed the capacity of clemastine fumarate to induce oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation and myelination with human OPCs (appendix).Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed articles published until Jan 10, 2017, without language restrictions reporting on remyelinating trials and treatments for multiple sclerosis.
 In our search, we used the terms “multiple sclerosis” OR “MS” OR “optic neuropathy” OR “visual evoked potential” OR “clemastine” AND “remyelination” initially filtering results for articles that report phase 1, 2, or 3 clinical trials.
 In addition, abstracts were reviewed from the American Academy of Neurology Meeting (AAN) and European Committee on Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis between 2006 and 2016.
 No previously successful randomised controlled trials using a remyelinating drug to treat a chronic demyelinating injury were reported.
 A number of clinical trials for acute relapses that principally focused on optic neuritis were identified, including one that assessed visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) as a secondary endpoint in a trial comparing simvastatin with placebo.
 This trial reported positive results in an intention-to-treat analysis but mismatch in severity was significant between the two groups, with the placebo group having more severe injury at baseline than the treated group.
 A successful phase 2 clinical trial of intravenous erythropoietin displayed improved VEP latency at 4 months as a secondary outcome in the treated group.
 In addition, a trial (RENEW) of opicinumab, a monoclonal antibody to inhibit LINGO 1, failed on its primary outcome in an intention-to-treat analysis, but showed apparent benefit in a per-protocol analysis.
 A second phase 2b study (SYNERGY) of opicinumab in patients with relapsing and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis did not reach its primary endpoint: a multicomponent measure that evaluated improvement of physical function, cognitive function, and disability.
 An additional trial of intravenous immunoglobulin did not show a beneficial effect for VEP.
 A clinical trial that showed efficacy for neuroprotection with phenytoin in acute optic neuritis using optical coherence tomography peripapillary nerve fibre as an outcome did not show effects on VEP latency.
 In addition, two observational studies that monitored patients with multiple sclerosis showed that patients had worsening or stable P100 latency on VEP rather than spontaneous improvement, and one concluded that this would therefore make a good biomarker for measurement in remyelinating clinical trials.
 Additional observational and animal studies suggested that VEPs showed promise as putative measures of both demyelination and remyelination in multiple sclerosis and animal models of demyelinating injury.Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial to establish the safety and efficacy of clemastine fumarate in patients with multiple sclerosis and to show a benefit from clemastine fumarate on VEP latency.
 Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is also the first successful trial to use a drug with substantial preclinical evidence to suggest a remyelinating effect that met its clinical endpoint with an intention-to-treat analysis and to show the effect of remyelinating therapy on chronic demyelination.
 Treatments capable of remyelination, neuroprotection, or regeneration are a major unmet need for multiple sclerosis and other diseases that involve myelin damage, loss, or dysfunction in the CNS.
 In the ReBUILD study, electrophysiological evidence of remyelination is seen in the context of a therapy with strong preclinical data, which suggests potential human efficacy.
 Furthermore, there is preliminary evidence to suggest that this effect might extend to low-contrast letter acuity—a well validated outcome of clinically relevant visual function in patients with multiple sclerosis.Implications of all available evidenceOur results lend support to the further investigation of the safety and efficacy of clemastine fumarate in patients with acute demyelinating injury and other forms of chronic demyelination.
 They also provide evidence that supports further investigation to optimise timing and dosing of clemastine fumarate, and to assess its effects in other pathways of the CNS.
 Furthermore, this study suggests that the visual system is an attractive model for studying repair and remyelination in the setting of chronic demyelination.Evoked potentials record cortical responses to a repetitive stimulus and can measure the speed of conduction in the CNS.
 Myelinated axons conduct electrical signals at 70–100 times the speed of unmyelinated axons of the same diameter.
 Pattern-reversal visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) record cortical responses on the scalp overlying the occipital lobe in response to an alternating repetitive visual stimulus.23Green AJ Visual evoked potentials, electroretinography, and other diagnostic approaches to the visual system.in: Aminoff MJ Aminoff's electrodiagnosis in clinical neurology.

 Clinically stable patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis who fulfilled international panel criteria for diagnosis13Polman CH Reingold SC Banwell B et al.Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: 2010 revisions to the McDonald criteria.Ann Neurol.
 2011; 69: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (5569) Google Scholar with disease duration of less than 15 years were eligible for screening.
 Although a previous clinically evident optic neuritis was not a requirement for enrolment, patients could not have had a clinical optic neuritis in the 6 months before screening or a documented optic neuritis in the qualifying eye for more than 5 years before screening.
 We designed inclusion criteria to ensure that patients had demyelinating injury in the visual pathway (VEP P100 latency in at least one eye of 118 ms) and to increase the likelihood that the number of surviving axons was sufficient to provide the needed substrate for remyelination to occur (approximated by retinal nerve fibre layer thickness on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography [OCT] &gt;70 μm in the VEP qualifying eye).
 Exclusion criteria included confounding ophthalmological disease that could affect vision or testing, changes in immunomodulatory therapy for multiple sclerosis in the 6 months before being randomly assigned, glucocorticoid use within 30 days before screening, concurrent use of 4-aminopyridine or fampridine,27Horton L Conger A Conger D et al.Effect of 4-aminopyridine on vision in multiple sclerosis patients with optic neuropathy.Neurology.

 The study was approved by the UCSF Institutional Review Board and all participants provided informed consent.
 The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT02040298) before initiation of patient enrolment.
 Randomisation and maskingWe randomly assigned patients to either group 1 (active treatment over the first 90 days followed by placebo for 60 days) or group 2 (placebo for 90 days, followed by active treatment for 60 days) without a washout between the two periods.
 Patients were reminded at each visit not to take any supplementary clemastine fumarate (or Tavist) and were asked if they had taken any added clemastine fumarate (no patients replied “yes”).
 ProceduresMedication was provided as unmarked blue capsules of 5·36 mg clemastine fumarate (Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Sellersburg, PA, USA) or placebo (corn starch; Medisca, Plattsburgh, NY, USA) by the UCSF investigational pharmacy.
 When on the active treatment, patients received 5·36 mg orally twice daily (10·72 mg/day).We recorded monocular transient full-field pattern-reversal VEPs with check size 64-min of arc with a Nihon-Kohden MEB-2300 (Nihon-Kohden, Irvine, CA, USA).
 At least 100 averages were obtained per recording.
 VEPs were done at screening, baseline, and months 1, 3, and 5.
 VEP latency was defined by the P100.
 We averaged recordings from baseline and screening for comparison with final outcomes.
 We analysed VEP recordings for quality before unmasking and those recordings of insufficient quality to unequivocally identify the P100 were discarded before analysis.
 Investigators not involved in the clinical assessment of patients or acquisition of data assessed VEP quality and marking of P100 latency and were masked to any assignment information in batch at completion of the study.For MRI analysis, all participants were scanned using a Siemens 3T Skyra scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 20-channel head-neck coil and a 32-channel spine coil array at baseline, and months 3 and 5.
 Sequences included myelin water fraction (MWF), magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR), and diffusion MRI.To evaluate visual function, we assessed high-contrast and low-contrast visual acuity monocularly with retro-illuminated 100% and 2·5% Sloan low-contrast vision charts, respectively (Precision Vision, La Salle, IL, USA).
 We recorded the number of letters the patients reported correctly and used this number for analysis.28Balcer LJ Frohman EM Evaluating loss of visual function in multiple sclerosis as measured by low-contrast letter acuity.Neurology.

 OutcomesThe primary outcome was shortening of P100 latency delay on full-field, pattern-reversal VEPs.
 With the following ranking, based on the presumed relative importance of these secondary endpoints, whole brain MTR, white matter MTR, white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), and MWF were secondary imaging endpoints for efficacy.
 Additional assessments included standard T1 (both before and after administration of gadolinium) and T2 at all timepoints (appendix).
 The principal functional secondary endpoint was low-contrast letter acuity (LCLA).
 We also assessed change in RNFL thickness from baseline as an exploratory endpoint at months 3 and 5.Adverse events were recorded at each visit.
 We obtained safety laboratory measures including transaminases, triglycerides, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations at each visit.

 We estimated that the sample size of 25 patients per group would give 90% power to detect a 50% relative reduction in latency with clemastine fumarate compared with placebo at the 3-month timepoint.
 We analysed data with both a prespecified analysis plan appropriate for a repeated-measures crossover trial and by evaluating the trial post hoc as a delayed-treatment trial.
 We considered p values less than 0·05 to be significant.
 We used an intention-to-treat approach including all patients randomly assigned to the study.
 Missing outcome data were accounted for using mixed-effects linear models.
 The crossover model included random effects for patient and for eyes within patient, and fixed-effects for the standard analysis of a 2 × 2 crossover model (an indicator for epoch 2 and an indicator for the active-treatment period) with additional adjustment for the baseline value.
 To mitigate the carryover effect and to optimally estimate the magnitude of the therapeutic effect, we did a parallel group comparison considering group 2 as subject to delayed treatment.
 In our primary analytical approach per the crossover analysis, the clemastine fumarate first group (group 1) was considered to be in the treatment group at months 1 and 3, and in the control group at month 5, whereas the placebo first group (group 2) was considered to be in the control group at months 1 and 3 and in the treatment group at month 5 (and both groups were control group at baseline).
 This crossover analysis regards the effect of clemastine fumarate as transitory, lasting only while the active drug is being given, whereas the post-hoc delayed-treatment analysis regards each group as having a before and after clemastine fumarate period, with the assumption that the effect of the drug is persistent throughout the timeframe of the study.
 We also did an additional post-hoc analysis evaluating the frequency of patients who showed significant evidence of VEP latency improvement from baseline, which was defined as more than 6 ms of improvement consistent with laboratory standards and previous scientific literature.
 This analysis was done before review of the data, but was not initially specified in our protocol.
 Additional sensitivity analyses excluded the 30-day measurement as a repeated measurement in period 1 (90 days), as well as modelling the time change linearly to account for the differential exposure to treatment in period 1 and period 2 (60 days; appendix).
 An independent faculty analyst (WJB) did all analyses with Stata version 13.
 Role of the funding sourceThe funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.
 The enrolled patients had an average age of 40·1 years (SD 10·3), mean mild disability with EDSS 2·2 (1·1), and mean disease duration of 5·1 years (5·1; table).
 Eyes with baseline RNFL thickness smaller than 70 μm in the non-qualifying eye were excluded as prespecified.
 Furthermore, VEPs for which a reproducible P100 was not identified were excluded from analysis (constituting 29 [6%] of 480 recordings), and therefore, 94% of all VEP recordings were included.
 93 eyes were informative for the final trial outcomes after considering these exclusions.
 Group 1 received active treatment (clemastine fumarate) for 90 days, followed by placebo for 60 days.
 Group 2 received placebo for 90 days, followed by active treatment (clemastine fumarate) for 60 days.
 Open table in a new tab       28 patients (56%) had a previous history of optic neuritis at an average of 4·3 years before enrolment (table).
 Baseline characteristics in terms of disability, VEP P100 latency, OCT measures, and other functional assessments were similar between the groups (table).No clinical relapses occurred during the trial.
 46 (92%) of the 50 patients were on immunomodulatory disease modifying therapy: 20 on injectable, 16 on oral, and ten on high-potency infusible therapies.
 No patient had a change in immunomodulatory therapy during the course of the trial.
 No interaction for any of the therapies was seen on any of the outcomes, but the trial was not powered to detect such interactions.Patients in both groups exhibited shortening of P100 latency while on the active compound.
 The clinical effect observed for group 1 was also sustained into the second epoch (figure 2).
 Given this sustained effect the so-called no-carryover assumption of the standard crossover model led to a substantial underestimate of the magnitude of the therapeutic effect of clemastine fumarate.
 Furthermore, 16% of group 1 and 26% of group 2 showed a latency improvement of more than 6 ms while on treatment compared with 3% of group 1 and 6% of group 2 while on placebo (figure 2) in a post-hoc analysis done based on lab standards of significant interocular differences and previous scientific literature.33Walsh JC Garrick R Cameron J McLeod JG Evoked potential changes in clinically definite multiple sclerosis: a two year follow up study.J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry.

 None of the predefined MRI measures, including new and enlarging T2 lesions, volume of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on T1, MWF, MTR, or FA on diffusion tensor imaging showed evidence of improvement or worsening while on study drug (appendix) either using the crossover or delayed-treatment analyses.
 The two groups did not differ in processing speed on study drug, as assessed by the SDMT.
 Additionally, EDSS, T25W, and 6MWT were unchanged by treatment with clemastine fumarate (appendix).Serious adverse events did not occur during the trial.
 Given the potential for participant unmasking as a consequence of fatigue, we did additional analyses to determine whether the primary trial result remained significant after controlling for fatigue.
 Controlling for fatigue had no effect on either the magnitude or statistical significance of the VEP or LCLA results (appendix).
 One patient had to modify dosing and timing of clemastine fumarate as a result of severe fatigue.
 Furthermore, a small number of patients exhibited increases in triglyceride concentrations over the course of the trial; however, this outcome had no discernible association to treatment.DiscussionTo our knowledge, this clinical trial in conjunction with published preclinical evidence related to clemastine fumarate and remyelination provides the first evidence of drug-induced repair in a chronic neurodegenerative condition.

 The simplification of the phenotype being studied by selecting patients on the basis of shared clinical deficits in an isolated functional pathway allowed for assessment of efficacy using a single clinical outcome.
 The visual pathway was selected as a suitable model for assessment because of its anatomical segregation and the precision of the clinical tests available for visual assessment.23Green AJ Visual evoked potentials, electroretinography, and other diagnostic approaches to the visual system.in: Aminoff MJ Aminoff's electrodiagnosis in clinical neurology.

 2010; 133: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar This trial highlights the value of this model for assessment of remyelination treatments in the chronic disease setting.
 We included patients who did not have a previous history of optic neuritis.
 A post-hoc analysis evaluating the history of optic neuritis showed the robustness of the effect of clemastine fumarate (despite the reduction in the size of the stratified sample) but could be taken to suggest that patients with a previous clinical episode of optic neuritis might have had a more pronounced response (appendix).Optimal trial design and analytical methods for early phase studies to assess drugs with potential for remyelination and repair have not been determined—especially for over-the-counter medications.
 The crossover trial design helped to establish the sustainability of the clinical benefit of clemastine fumarate and enhanced the power of the study to detect an effect in a relatively small population.
 Furthermore, it made recruitment for a trial with a non-prescription medication possible because all patients were granted access to the study drug.
 However, the standard statistical approach for analysing crossover study data includes an assumption that there is no carryover of treatment effect—ie, any benefit from earlier clemastine fumarate treatment is not sustained during the control epoch.
 This assumption did not hold in this study, which points to the potential reparative effect of the medication.
 However, the magnitude of the benefit of clemastine fumarate in this model is estimated on the basis of this assumption of no carryover.
 Thus, a standard crossover analytical approach underestimates the true magnitude of the therapeutic effect because it falsely discounts the sustained benefit in epoch 2 for group 1.
 The benefit of clemastine fumarate treatment on VEP latency showed substantial carryover (ie, the improvement in latency plateaus and persists after cessation of treatment which—given the goal of structural repair—is a desirable outcome).
 Furthermore, greater improvements in latency for group 2 patients than for group 1 patients were seen during their period on treatment; however, given the assumption about no carryover, the primary analysis underestimates the contribution of this effect (as the sustained group 1 benefits are compared with the group 2 benefits on treatment).
 Therefore, an assessment of the study results as a delayed-treatment trial provides an accurate estimate of the magnitude of the therapeutic effect.
 We have presented both methods of analysis to show that a treatment effect is observed using either analytical method.
 However, we consider the delayed-treatment analysis to provide a more realistic appraisal of the magnitude of the therapeutic benefit achieved with clemastine fumarate at this dose.
 Additionally, in a post-hoc analysis that evaluated the VEP data using a 6 ms improvement threshold (which, based on experience and previous literature,33Walsh JC Garrick R Cameron J McLeod JG Evoked potential changes in clinically definite multiple sclerosis: a two year follow up study.J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry.

 In fact, a modestly greater magnitude of effect was observed in group 2, but the significance of this observation cannot be determined because it could be due to baseline differences between the groups that were not balanced by randomisation.
 In addition, although the sustained clinical response of group 1 indicates that the clinical effect is not transient, whether the clinical response is maintained over the long term (ie, longer than 2 months) is uncertain.This trial provides a framework for future assessments of remyelinating therapies for patients with multiple sclerosis.
 In particular, these results indicate that evoked potentials are a promising and sensitive measure of putative remyelination with effective drugs.
 The trial also supports the potential clinical benefit of adding a remyelinating drug in stable patients on a pre-existing immunomodulatory therapy.Patients showed evidence of improvement in LCLA performance that did not meet our prespecified standard for statistical significance using the crossover analysis.
 However, when analysed with the delayed-treatment model, improvements in LCLA reached statistical significance.

 2007; 13: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar This clinical effect was confounded by a learning effect observed for LCLA assessments over the course of the trial.
 This made detection of clinical effects of the drug more difficult.
 Future investigations might seek to use additional tests of visual function to help further resolve the clinical effect of treatment.Preselected MRI measures were unable to detect biological effects.
 Additional evaluation of our MRI results to assess for novel or promising new ways to analyse the data will be the subject of further study.Patients in the trial showed worsened fatigue on the basis of MAF while on treatment.
 Fatigue is reported as a symptom in 65–95% of patients with multiple sclerosis.
 As many as 40% of patients report that it is the most disabling symptom of their disease.37Hadjimichael O Vollmer T Oleen-Burkey M Fatigue characteristics in multiple sclerosis: the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) survey.Health Qual Life Outcomes.
 2008; 6: 100Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar We cannot determine if this fatigue effect is due to action on the target muscarinic receptor or might reflect effects on other receptors, such as histamine receptors.
 1987; 43: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar Furthermore, animal experiments indicate that at our selected dose we only achieved partial saturation of the target muscarinic receptor (data not shown; dose adjusted).
 Non-selective drugs with anticholinergic effects have been suggested to have anticognitive effects in uncontrolled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis.39Cruce R Vosoughi R Freedman MS Cognitive impact of anticholinergic medication in MS: Adding insult to injury?.Mult Scler Relat Disord.
 2012; 1: 156-161Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar A significant anticognitive effect was not observed in this trial at doses exceeding existing standard recommendations.A limitation of the current trial is that it cannot ascertain whether the potential remyelinating effects of clemastine fumarate are sustained beyond the period of study, nor can it assess if continued dosing of clemastine fumarate would yield continued benefits.
 It cannot be used to assess whether higher doses would provide enhanced beneficial effects and it certainly cannot evaluate the risks of such higher or alternative dosing regimens.
 We also could not establish if the effects seen in the visual system might reflect that this pathway is more amenable to repair than others, nor given the size of the study could we fully evaluate if certain patient characteristics are most likely to be associated with the observed benefits.The stability of myelin in the adult CNS remains a matter of controversy.40Yeung MS Zdunek S Bergmann O et al.Dynamics of oligodendrocyte generation and myelination in the human brain.Cell.
 2014; 159: 766-774Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar The results reported here suggest the dynamic potential of an endogenous precursor population for medically induced remyelination in adults with multiple sclerosis.
 Future work will be needed to establish the longer-term effect of remyelination on prevention of axonal loss and disability progression, identify the extent of repair that is achievable with more selective and targeted drugs, and define the optimal dosing regimens and duration of treatment.
 Additional preclinical work should address the specificity of VEP latency changes in animal models using drugs such as clemastine fumarate for remyelination.
 Furthermore, we will need to determine optimal timing of treatment by evaluation of other stages of disease, such as following acute demyelinating injury.
