 Highly recommend!
 I know a lot of people here love them though.
 For example, was there a significant transit when you met your partner or when you received a job you wanted?
 Or even a solar return aspect/year that was significant.
 Any insight about this?
 Honestly I'm not sure if my Mercury is combust, but my Venus is.
 All in 11th house.
 My Venus sextiles Mars, trines Saturn, conjuncts Neptune in addition.
 Mercury sextiles Pluto and is in retrograde.
 I'd like help.
 I just generally want to know what combustion really means for Mercury and Venus.
 Perhaps the thing that bugs me more is that the body of astrological knowledge is a disjointed mess.
 No matter which direction I look, everyone is holding contradictory notions about how all of this works and how you should procede.
 Every discipline has this kind of \"schools of thought\" but I think the case of astrology really is a great obstacle since the common ground between then is really, really small and there is little knowledge that can be really integrated between different paradigms.
 Sometimes I feel that we just keep to what other people postulated decades, centuries or thousands of years ago, and when someone tries to bring up their own observations or maybe integrate and play with established concepts, those people is shut down almost immediately.
 I just feel something is lacking, and while I think astrology could be really useful, I don't find any application for it as it is now anymore.
 I don't think I will focus on astrology any further for the time being.
 Sorry for the rant, but I guess is the only place where people could possibly understand.
 I'm not sure if anything I'm sharing isn't allowed to be shared, so if it isn't I apologize in advance (please let me know lol)!
 Since then, not a day goes by that I don't think about it, and I've just been undergoing this endless journey to constantly learn more about astrology.
 Scrutinizing my chart has helped me realize so many things about myself, but there's still so much I find to be challenging.
 My deepest wound lies in my communication and learning abilities, and thought processes(?
 It's just extremely difficult to communicate with others in my life, particularly in real life.
 Actually, online too can be a challenge because I tend to type a really overwhelming amount of sentences and literally can't hold myself back from sending my friends paragraphs, tweeting too much, and dominating group chats etc.
 For essays/papers, (even before the pandemic, so it's not just due to anxiety from that) it's really challenging for me to just start.
 I feel like I have so much inside of me that I want to express to others, but that need does not come into fruition easily, and there are so many other placements/aspects that make this even more difficult.
 After March, I was put on academic probation at my university and took two gap semesters off summer and fall (but I plan to return in the spring); I know basically every American uni student has been wondering if they have ADHD, but it seriously feels like I have it, especially because of how excessive and intense my virtual, typed communication has been all my life (I also have an Aries stellium, so I wonder if that could be an indicator of it?
 I mean of course, it's something to be diagnosed by a medical professional - I'm just also wondering if all this intense energy that my stellium in Aries brings could possibly be a factor, especially with one of the planets being ✨ Mercury ✨ ).
 In many social situations I'll just stay quiet, and I feel my body tense, and my face go emotionless, almost as if it's involuntary.
 I can only think clearly and converse if certain people are there.
 What this feels like, is basically how my Chiron in Scorpio in the 3rd house combined with my Virgo rising feels like, except, the effect is ten-fold.
 These three combined just make me feel so stuck in life.
 A big part of me just remains hidden and it feels like that side will never find its place in the world.
 My self-image is really distorted and I have so much soul-searching to do to form my personality...I also have my 12th house ruled by Leo, so it just feels like a huge part of me is hidden 24/7, and I often feel that people have the wrong idea of me.
 How these two placements manifest is that I feel 'close' to everyone at once, yet I simultaneously feel extremely lonely.
 I am the person that people go to to talk about their 'real' and 'deep' stuff in life, and while I find that flattering, I also feel like no one really cares about me?
 Like, I feel like I become 'best friends' with so many people at different times, but then after a while we never talk anymore, even though I felt like we connected really deeply.
 It's as if there's this spark that burns so bright, and then dies out, with no indication of whether or not it'll revive in the unforeseeable future.
 So basically I'm no fun, and I constantly feel like this outcast (which could also be influenced by my Aquarius stellium [some people say 3 planets are a stellium and some say 4, I don't know, but either way I FEEL it]).
 Even though I'm a Virgo Rising, that Pisces placement takes over so often, and it's difficult to stay and feel grounded.
 In BPD, what sometimes happens to me is dissociation.
 (Also, if you think that my Pisces South Node has caused me to procrastinate on things so that I could write this post, you are absolutely correct).
 With my Moon in the 10th house (in the Placidus system) also there, it means that prestige and acceptance by the public is really important to me.
 It resonates, but it's going to take 20 mountains to get there, because that's how all these aspects feel like, lmaoooo.
 (or all of them combined) that's responsible for my internal fluctuating moods, but whatever it is, I geniuinely can't tell if I hate everyone I interact with, or if I'm just having a bad day or hour.
 There's just so much fire and air in my chart, and my emotions feel really strong, but on the outside I appear extremely calm to others (Virgo Rising/5th House Cap/Aqua Venus).
 I struggle so much with expressing my feelings, regulating my thoughts, and overall just building and maintaining coping mechanisms for the emotional turmoil that is brought upon me by all the suffering in the world.
 I’ve read a lot about this placement and it seems it’s pretty negative.
 Does anyone have any positives regarding this placement, or any advice?
 It is called the Curse of Tippecanoe.
 Can anyone tell me more?
 What will you create?
 BaZi.
 Let's look from BaZi's point of view what happened in their relationship.
 And could it be otherwise.
 To do this, we will perform a simple analysis in the program.
 Where is John's leading card.
 And also it became a little better in the element of the soul.
 In real life, this was expressed in the fact that next to Amber, John felt like flying on wings.
 For those who study BaZi, it is a regulated condition.
 Which can be achieved by knowing the secrets of the elements.
 hopefully I dont get yelled at for this since I did on TikTok lol.
 but im confused on cusps.
 Do they exist?
 My birthday is May 21 and I've been called a taurus or a gemini all my life because of different charts.
 I'm very shy, indecisive, nervous, and always been called an \"old soul\" so Taurus fit pretty well.
 however, after seeing some astrology videos, they all seem to say that cusps aren't real.
 I did a sign chart on a site and I think it put me in Gemini even though I exhibit no traits of a Gemini that I know of.
 Can anyone explain?
 Sorry if this is a dumb question just kinda confused on the whole topic.
 I'll put the degrees I got below and if anyone can explain what they mean that would be great.
 Thank you!!
 T.I.A.
 (Barring significant systemic fraud or upheaval of democracy,) the transits after election day only affect how the votes are counted, how the news trickles out, and how the nominees react as the results come out.
 The Moon affects how we and the candidates react to the news that comes out.
 I'll be looking at the reactions of the candidates and how they correlate to the transit of the Moon to their natal charts.
 Times are approximate and in ET (Trump was in Washinton DC, Biden was in Delaware).
 Trump makes a tweet claiming Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina.
 Trump makes his first speech, appearing to claim victory.
 Biden makes his first speech, expressing a positive outlook.
 His transition website is also launched.
 Trump makes his first tweets after his first speech, including 'STOP THE COUNT!'
 (Moon is also conjunct Biden's Lilith.
 Biden makes a speech, projecting confidence.
 No apparent transits here, although to note that Moon square Trump's Chiron is at 9:30 pm.
 My speculation is that he is beginning to feel his narcissistic wound here, leading to one of the most so-called 'unhinged' speeches in his presidency, that news networks immediately took off the air.
 Tweetstorm as Georgia flips towards Biden.
 Decision Desk (Vox) calls the race for Biden once Pennsylvania flips.
 Trump tweets in response.
 I get the information individually but what does it mean as a whole?
 From what I understand, the 7th is sort of, contract type relationships?
 Long term relationships, marriage, business agreements, etc., and have heard that, at least regarding 7th house chart rulership, I should be mindful of these types of relationship and my give and take within them, that people with this tend to either give way too much or take way too much and that we’ve gotta find a balance and boundaries and what not?
 I do absolutely tend to lose myself to people and usually end up in a sort of, carer/scapegoat kinda role.
 This is even evident in the relationship with my mother who struggles with addiction, I have often had to look after her and be who she wants/needs, even in childhood.
 I have a tendency to mould to what people want I guess?
 I give wayyyyyyy more than I receive 90% of the time.
 Anyway, would this have something to do with the 7th house rulership?
 And what added effect would having a 7th house ruler in Pisces, AND a stellium in the 7th have?
 Especially considering a lot of my stellium is in Pisces?
 I also find it so contradictory because, this is going to sound awful, but I actually can’t stand people and working with others most of the time.
 Don’t get me wrong, I love being and collaborating with a very few likeminded individuals, and when I have long term relationships/agreements I am 1000 percent ride or die, but as a whole I’m not a fan of the whole “let’s be in this together 4 lyf” vibe unless under very certain circumstances.
 Again, could this be all the 7th house mojo?
 Like I don’t want anything to do with it unless it’s fucking serious at both ends if you know what I mean?
 Is this something that can be worked past or if, considering our planets are so against each other, I should take it to heart?
 I will also add that because it is on the DC, I regard it to the portal of past lives, who your past loves were, how you grow in relationships and more importantly how you grow in the relationship with the self.
 Imagine a realm where you can step into you birth chart, 4D real time, you are now standing on the point of your DC, you can look straight ahead and see the glorious rising constellation.
 So, I think the 7th house is a lot of internal visualization of how we interact with the universe.
 Yes, I do think it can represent the other, like adversaries, marriage, long term contracts, and legal situations.
 But are we not in a long term (hopefully) contract with ourselves?
 The 7th house is played down in modern astrology takes, but that’s just my opinion.
 \u0026 Yes, sadly I am a 7th house pisces stellium with all my inner planets looking directly at my virgo rising 12 degrees.
 It’s a hard, reflective life.
 So my question to the professional and passionate astrologers is- how do you see the 7th house?
 So I've been reading about star signs and their elemental associations.
 I haven’t heard people talk about this too much.
 I’ve read that it can be really good or lead to something bad in your life.
 Can someone explains what it means for me, please?
 I also believe that I have dyslexia and insomnia.
 I still have to see a doctor for those.
 I just recently got into the world of astrology.
 I’ve read a bunch of general descriptions of Sagittarius’ and they’ve pretty much always been scary accurate.
 But my adhd causes most of my Sagittarius traits.
 Is there a correlation to the mental stuff you go through in your natal chart?
 What planets govern your mental stability?
