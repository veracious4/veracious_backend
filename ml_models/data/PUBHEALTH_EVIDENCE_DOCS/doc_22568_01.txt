Act 1 does not require labor organizations to provide servicesto anyone.  Act 1 merely prohibits employers from requiring union membership orthe payment of fees as a condition of employment.  Unions have no constitutionalentitlement to the fees of non-member employees.  Machinists Local Lodge 1061 v.Walker,

 of policy.  (1)The legislature finds thatthe practice of unfair discrimination in employment against propœ
erly qualified individuals by reason of their age, race, creed, color,disability,
 marital status, sex, national origin, ancestry, sexual oriœ
entation, arrest record, conviction record, military service, use ornonuse of lawful products off the employer's premises duringnonworking hours, or declining to attend a meeting or to particiœ
pate in any communication about religious matters or politicalmatters, substantially and adversely affects the general welfare ofthe state.  Employers, labor organizations, employment agencies,and licensing agencies that deny employment opportunities anddiscriminate in employment against properly qualified individuœ
als solely because of their age, race, creed, color, disability, mariœ
tal status, sex, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, arrestrecord, conviction record, military service, use or nonuse of lawœ
ful products off the employer's premises during nonworkinghours, or declining to attend a meeting or to participate in anycommunication about religious matters or political matters,deprive those individuals of the earnings that are necessary tomaintain a just and decent standard of living.(2)It is the intent of the legislature to protect by law the rightsof all individuals to obtain gainful employment and to enjoy priviœ
leges free from employment discrimination because of age, race,creed, color, disability, marital status, sex, national origin, ancesœ
try,
 sexual orientation, arrest record, conviction record, militaryservice, use or nonuse of lawful products off the employer's premœ
ises during nonworking hours, or declining to attend a meeting orto participate in any communication about religious matters orpolitical matters, and to encourage the full, nondiscriminatory utiœ
lization of the productive resources of the state to the benefit of thestate, the family, and all the people of the state.  It is the intent ofthe legislature in promulgating this subchapter to encourageemployers to evaluate an employee or applicant for employmentbased upon the individual qualifications of the employee or appliœ
cant rather than upon a particular class to which the individualmay belong.(3)In the interpretation and application of this subchapter, andotherwise, it is declared to be the public policy of the state toencourage and foster to the fullest extent practicable the employœ
ment of all properly qualified individuals regardless of age, race,creed, color, disability, marital status, sex, national origin, ancesœ
try,
 sexual orientation, arrest record, conviction record, militaryservice, use or nonuse of lawful products off the employer's premœ
ises during nonworking hours, or declining to attend a meeting orto participate in any communication about religious matters orpolitical matters.  Nothing in this subsection requires an affirmaœ
tive action program to correct an imbalance in the work force.This subchapter shall be liberally construed for the accomœ
plishment of this purpose.(4)The practice of requiring employees or prospectiveemployees to submit to a test administered by means of a lie detecœ
tor,
 as defined in s. 11
1.37 (1) (b), is unfair, the practice of requestœ
ing employees and prospective employees to submit to such a testwithout providing safeguards for the test subjects is unfair, and theuse of improper tests and testing procedures causes injury to theemployees and prospective employees.(5)The legislature finds that the prohibition of discriminationon the basis of creed under s. 111.337
 is a matter of statewide conœ
cern, requiring uniform enforcement at state, county and municiœ
pal levels.History:  1977 c. 125; 1979 c. 319; 1981 c. 112, 334, 391; 1987 a. 63; 1991 a. 289,310, 315; 1997 a. 112; 2007 a. 159; 2009 a. 290.The department is not limited to finding sex discrimination only when a 14thamendment equal protection violation can also be found.

  With respect to municipal employees who areemployed by a county with a population of 750,000 or more, thecounty executive is responsible for the municipal employer funcœ

 OF
 MUNICIPAL
 EMPLOYEES.
  Municipal employeeshave the right of self-organization, and the right to form, join, orassist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through repreœ
sentatives of their own choosing, and to engage in lawful, conœ
certed activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or othermutual aid or protection.  Municipal employees have the right torefrain from any and all such activities.  A general municipalemployee has the right to refrain from paying dues while remainœ
ing a member of a collective bargaining unit.  A public safetyemployee or a transit employee, however, may be required to paydues in the manner provided in a fair-share agreement; a fair-share agreement covering a public safety employee or a transitemployee must contain a provision requiring the municipalemployer to deduct the amount of dues as certified by the labororganization
 from the earnings of the employee affected by thefair-share agreement and to pay the amount deducted to the labororganization.
  A fair-share agreement covering a public safetyemployee or transit employee is subject to the right of the municiœ
pal employer or a labor organization to petition the commissionto conduct a referendum.  Such petition must be supported byproof that at least 30 percent of the employees in the collectivebargaining
 unit desire that the fair-share agreement be termiœ
nated.  Upon so finding, the commission shall conduct a referenœ

The plain language of Act 10 delayedits effectiveness with respect to individual school employees and school districts untilafter the expiration of their existing collective bargaining agreements, and the stateconstitution prohibits state laws that substantially impair existing contracts.

Wisconsin ProfessionalPolice Association v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, 2013 WI App145, 352 Wis. 2d 218, 841 N.W.2d 839, 12-2701.The initial applicability provisions of 2011 Wis. Acts 10 and 32 applicable to thetreatments of this section by those acts contain no clear expression of the intentionto retroactively upend the settled expectations of collective bargaining agreements(CBAs) that were negotiated and agreed upon months before those acts took effect,but which had not taken effect.

(1) (f), (3g), (4) (d) 3., (4) (mb), and the third sentence of sub. (2) do not vioœlate the plaintiffs' associational rights.  No matter the limitations or burdens a legislaœtive enactment places on the collective bargaining process, collective bargainingremains a creation of legislative grace and not constitutional obligation.  The restricœtions attached to the statutory scheme of collective bargaining are irrelevant inregards to freedom of association because no condition is being placed on the deciœsion to participate.  If a general employee participates in collective bargaining underAct 10's statutory framework, that general employee has not relinquished a constituœtional right.  They have only acquired a benefit to which they were never constitutionœally entitled.  Madison Teachers, Inc. v. Walker, 2014 WI 99, 358 Wis. 2d 1, 851N.W.2d
 337, 12-2067.When WERC had received detailed and specific complaints of past coercion inother certification elections, a WERC employee lawfully performed the balancing
test in concluding that the public interest in elections free from voter intimidation andcoercion outweighed the public interest in favor of openness of public records.  Thepublic interest in certification elections that are free from intimidation and coercionis evidenced by the requirement that those elections be conducted by secret ballot andfree from prohibited practices.  The public interest in elections that are free fromintimidation and coercion outweighs the public interest in favor of open publicrecords under the circumstances presented in this case.

 Act 10's various restrictions, in their cumulative effect, do not violate unionmembers' associational rights.  The 1st amendment does not require the state to mainœtain policies that allow certain associations to thrive.  For the most part, the Bill ofRights enshrines negative liberties.
