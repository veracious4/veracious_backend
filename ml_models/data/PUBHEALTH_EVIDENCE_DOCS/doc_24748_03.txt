 Nominee Avoids Confrontation at HearingDawn Johnsen and David Kris, nominees to Justice Department posts, met with the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.Credit...Ruth Fremson/The New York TimesBy Neil A. LewisFeb.
 25, 2009WASHINGTON  Newly changed political realities were on vivid display on Wednesday as the Senate Judiciary Committee met to question Dawn Johnsen, President Obama’s nominee to head the Office of Legal Counsel.Ms.
 Johnsen, a law professor at Indiana University, had once worked as legal counsel to an abortion rights group and was once of the most outspoken critics of the Bush administration’s interrogation and detention policies.
 She has been sharply criticized by some conservatives and was expected to be given a rough ride by the Judiciary Committee’s Republicans, but their appetite for combat seemed stilled on Wednesday.Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who ran the hearing, noted how the Office of Legal Counsel under President Bush produced legal memorandums, later repudiated, that appeared to condone torture and violation of international law.She said Ms. Johnsen, who was a critic of those memorandums, would serve as “the conscience of the Justice Department.” Ms. Johnsen had said earlier in the hearing that she believed torture was, in all cases, illegal and that the procedure known as waterboarding was torture.
 Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, noted that Michael B. Mukasey, President George W. Bush’s last attorney general, had declined to say waterboarding was torture because he had not seen it in operation.
 Mr.
 Sessions seemed to imply Ms. Johnsen was too hasty in forming her views, but he did not say so explicitly.Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the committee’s ranking Republican, brought up comments made 20 years ago in a brief Ms. Johnsen filed before the Supreme Court when she represented Naral, an abortion rights group.Mr.
 Specter suggested that she had asserted that pregnancy was comparable to slavery and that abortion rights should be protected by the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery.Ms.
 Johnsen said that in a footnote in her brief, she had made a suggestion of an analogy but never “believed the 13th Amendment had any role” in the abortion issue.
 The footnote said forcing a woman to continue to bear a child after she had no desire to do so was “disturbingly suggestive of involuntary servitude.” Separately, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said at a news conference on Wednesday that the detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, which he visited this week, was a professionally run operation, but that the administration remained determined to close it within a year.“It will not be an easy process,” said Mr. Holder, who has been named by Mr. Obama to lead a review of detention policies.
