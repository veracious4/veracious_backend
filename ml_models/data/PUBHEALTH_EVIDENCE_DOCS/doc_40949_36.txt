 )DOI:10.1111/jth.14810Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar In this Comment we summarise the characteristics of COVID-19 coagulopathy, coagulation laboratory findings in affected patients, the prohaemostatic state and incidence of thromboembolic events, and potential therapeutic interventions.The most typical finding in patients with COVID-19 and coagulopathy is an increased D-dimer concentration, a relatively modest decrease in platelet count, and a prolongation of the prothrombin time.
 In a series6Guan WJ Ni ZY Hu Y et al.Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China.N Engl J Med.
 2020; 382: 1708-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (5177) Google Scholar of 1099 patients with COVID-19 from China, elevated D-dimer (&gt;0·5 mg/L) was found in 260 (46%) of 560 patients.

 2020; 18: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar in 183 patients with COVID-19 in China, a mean D-dimer concentration of 2·12 mg/L (range 0·77–5·27) was measured in patients who didn't survive compared to a concentration of 0·61 mg/L (0·35–1·29) in survivors.
