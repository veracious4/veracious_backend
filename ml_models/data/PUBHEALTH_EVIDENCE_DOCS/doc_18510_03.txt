2 National Vital
 Statistics Reports, Vol.
 61, No. 6, October 10, 2012 All comparisons in this report are between the 2010 final data (3) and the 2011
 preliminary data. Changes in death rates from 2010 to 2011
 were tested for statistical significance. Differences
 in death rates across demographic groups (but occurring in 2011
 only) were also tested for statistical significance. Unless otherwise specified, reported differences
 in death rates are statistically significant. Age-adjusted death rates are better indicators than crude death rates for showing changes in the risk of death over time when the age distribution of the population is changing, and for comparing the mortality of population subgroups that have different
 age compositions. All age-adjusted death rates are standardized to the year 2000 lation (see ‚‚Computing
 rates and percentages™™
 in the Technical
 Notes). Life expectancy data shown in this report for data years 2010Œ2011
 are based on methodology similar to that of the 1999Œ2001 decennial life tables. Beginning with final data reported for 2008, the life table methodology was revised by changing the smoothing nique used to estimate the life table functions at the oldest ages; see Technical
 Notes (1). The methodology used to produce life cies adjusts for misclassification for Hispanic and for race and ethnicity for the non-Hispanic populations (see ‚‚Life
 tables™™
 in the Technical
 Notes). Adjustments do not account for other sources of error such as return migration (4). Note that adjustments for misclassification are applied to the production of the life tables, but not to the death rates shown in this report. Two
 measures of infant mortality are shown: the infant death rate and the infant mortality rate (see ‚‚Infant
 mortality™™
 in the Technical
 Notes). These measures typically are similar,
 although they can differ
 because they have different
 denominators. Results Trends
 in numbers and rates The preliminary number of deaths in the United States for 2011
 was 2,513,171 (Tables
 A and 1). The crude death rate of 806.6 per 100,000 population was 0.9 percent higher than the rate of 799.5 per 100,000 in 2010. The estimated age-adjusted death rate, which accounts for changes in the age distribution of the population, reached a record low of 740.6 per 100,000 U.S. standard population, 0.9 percent lower than the 2010 rate of 747.0 (Tables
 A and 1). Figure 1 illustrates the general pattern of decline in both crude and age-adjusted death rates since 1980. The age-adjusted death rate decreased from 2010 to 2011
 by 1.4 percent for males and 0.5 percent for females. The relative magnitudes of significant changes in age-adjusted death rates by sex, race, and Hispanic origin (Table
 1)ar
e:
 + White malesŠ1.0 percent decrease + Non-Hispanic white malesŠ0.6 percent decrease + Black malesŠ3.3 percent decrease + Black femalesŠ1.6 percent decrease + Non-Hispanic black malesŠ2.7 percent decrease + Non-Hispanic black femalesŠ1.2 percent decrease + AIAN malesŠ5.9 percent decrease + AIAN femalesŠ3.7 percent decrease + API malesŠ4.2 percent decrease + API femalesŠ2.6 percent decrease + Hispanic malesŠ4.8 percent decrease + Hispanic femalesŠ2.5 percent decrease Rates for the AIAN and API populations should be interpreted with caution because of inconsistencies between reporting race on death certificates and on censuses, surveys, and birth certificates. Note that mortality for races other than white and black may be seriously understated in some cases due to underreporting for some race groups and Hispanic origin on death certificates (4Œ6). Statistically significant decreases in mortality from 2010 to 2011
 were registered for those under age 1 year and across age groups over 65 years. Decedents aged 25Œ34 experienced the only statistically significant increase. Mortality for age groups 1Œ4 years, 5Œ14 years, 15Œ24 years, 35Œ44 years, 45Œ54 years, and 55Œ64 years did not change significantly.
 The magnitude of the significant changes in mortality by age group is (Table
 1): + Under 1 yearŠ4.0 percent decrease + 25Œ34 yearsŠ1.5 percent increase + 65Œ74 yearsŠ1.6 percent decrease + 75Œ84 yearsŠ0.8 percent decrease + 85 years and overŠ1.2 percent decrease The death rate for ‚‚under
 1 year™™
 shown above is based on a population estimate and is different
 from the infant mortality rate, which is based on live births (see ‚‚Infant
 mortality™™).
 The preliminary estimate of life expectancy at birth for the total population in 2011
 is 78.7 years. This is the same as in 2010 (Tables
 A and 6). Life expectancy for males increased 0.1 year,
 from 76.2 in 2010 to 76.3 in 2011.
 Female life expectancy also increased 0.1 year,
 from 81.0 years to 81.1 years. (Life expectancy from 2010 to 2011
 differed
 for the male and female populations but was unchanged for both sexes combined due to rounding.) The difference
 between male and female life expectancy at birth has generally been decreasing since its peak of 7.8 years in 1979 (1,7). The gap between male and female life expectancy was 4.8 years in 2011,
 unchanged from the difference
 between the sexes in 2010. The difference
 in life expectancy between the white and black populations in 2011
 was 3.7 years, a 0.1-year decrease from the 2010 gap between the two races (Table
 A). Life expectancy for the Hispanic population increased 0.2 year in 2011
 to 81.4 years compared with 2010 (Table
 6). In 2011,
 the life expectancy for the Hispanic female population was 83.7 years. The life expectancy for the Hispanic male population in 2011
 was 78.9. The difference
 in life expectancy between the sexes for the Hispanic population was 4.8 years. Among the six Hispanic origin-race-sex groups (Table
 6 and Figure 2), Hispanic females have the highest life expectancy at birth (83.7 years), followed by non-Hispanic white females (81.1 years), Hispanic males (78.9 years), non-Hispanic black females (77.8 years), non-Hispanic white males (76.4 years), and non-Hispanic black males (71.6 years). Figure 2 also shows that this pattern has not changed since 2006 although life expectancy for all groups has generally increased. By state of residence, Hawaii had the lowest mortality in 2011
 with an age-adjusted death rate of 584.8 deaths per 100,000 standard population (Table
 3). Mortality was highest in Mississippi, with an age-adjusted death rate of 956.2 per 100,000 standard population.  3 National Vital

 61, No. 6, October 10, 2012 Causes of death The leading causes of death in 2011
 remained the same as in 2010 for the 15 leading causes, although two causes exchanged ranks. Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis, the eighth leading cause in 2010, became the ninth leading cause in 2011,
 while Influenza and pneumonia, the ninth leading cause in 2010, became the eighth leading cause of death in 2011.
 The 15 leading causes of death in 2011
 (Table

 Septicemia 12. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis 13. Essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease 14. Parkinson™s disease 15. Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids From 2010 to 2011,
 the age-adjusted death rate declined significantly for 5 of the 15 leading causes of death. The age-adjusted death rate for the leading cause of death, Diseases of heart, decreased by 3.0 percent. The age-adjusted death rate for Malignant neoplasms decreased by 2.4 percent (Tables
 B and 2). Deaths from these two diseases combined accounted for 47 percent of deaths in the United States in 2011.
 Heart disease mortality has exhibited a fairly steady decline since 1980, and cancer mortality began to decline in the early 1990s (8). Of the 15 leading causes of death, the age-adjusted death rate also decreased significantly for cular diseases (3.1 percent), Alzheimer™s disease (2.0 percent), and Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis (12.4 percent). The decrease in deaths from Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis from 2010 to 2011
 needs to be interpreted with caution, however.
 Changes in classification and coding were made in 2011
 that contributed to the decrease. Renal failure, for example, mentioned on death certificates was more likely to be treated as a renal complication of other diseases on the death certificate in 2011.
 As a result, more of these records shift from the Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and rosis category to other diseases (e.g., Diabetes mellitus with renal complications, which is part of the broader Diabetes mellitus category). The age-adjusted death rate increased significantly from 2010 to 2011
 for six leading causes: Chronic lower respiratory diseases (1.2 percent), Diabetes mellitus (3.4 percent), Influenza and monia (4.0 percent), Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (3.2 percent), Parkinson™s disease (2.9 percent), and Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids (3.9 percent). The observed changes in the age-adjusted death rates from 2010 to 2011
 were not significant for Accidents (unintentional injuries), tional self-harm (suicide), Septicemia, and Essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease. Although Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease was not among the 15 leading causes of death in 2011
 for all ages combined, it remains a public health concern, especially for those between the ages of 15 and 64. The age-adjusted death rate for HIV disease declined by 7.7 percent from 2010 to 2011
 (Table
 2). Following a period of increase from 1987 through 1994, HIV disease mortality reached a plateau in 1995. Subsequently,
 the rate for this disease decreased an average of 33.0 percent per year from 1995 through 1998 (9), and 6.5 percent per year from 1999 through 2010 (data not shown). For all races combined in the age group 15Œ24, HIV disease was the 12th leading cause of death in 2010 and 2011.

 Statistics Reports, Vol.
 61, No. 6, October 10, 2012 the seventh leading cause of death in 2010 to the eighth leading cause in 2011
 for the age group 25Œ44. Among decedents aged 45Œ64, HIV disease remained the 13th leading cause in 2011,
 unchanged from its rank in 2010. Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), a nantly antibiotic-associated inflammation of the intestines caused by C. difficile, a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus, has become a concern in recent years. The disease is often acquired by long-term patients or residents in hospitals or other health-care facilities and accounted for an increasing number of deaths between 1999 and 2008 (1,10,11).
 In 1999, 793 deaths were due to C. difficile, compared with 7,476 C. difficile deaths in 2008 (1). The number of deaths dropped slightly to 7,251 in 2009 and increased to 7,994 in 2011.
 The age-adjusted death rate for this cause in 2011
 was 2.4 deaths per 100,000 standard population, an increase of 9.1 percent from the rate in 2010. In 2011,
 C. difficile ranked as the 17th leading cause of death for the population aged 65 and over.
 Approximately 91 percent of deaths from C. difficile occurred to people aged 65 and over (data not shown). The age-adjusted death rate for drug-induced deaths did not change significantly,
 according to preliminary data. However,
 the final number of drug-induced deaths in 2011
 may be substantially higher because information on cause of death in these cases is often delayed pending investigation. Additional information based on toxicology or autopsy reports is often not available in the preliminary file. Mortality from firearm injuries and alcohol-induced deaths in 2011
 was unchanged from 2010. The age-adjusted death rate for injury at work in 2011
 decreased 5.9 percent from the final rate of 1.7 in 2010 to 1.6 in 2011
 (Table
 2). Infant mortality The preliminary infant mortality rate for 2011
 was 6.05 infant deaths per 1,000 live births (Tables
 A and 4). This was not cantly different
 from the final 2010 rate of 6.15. Few observed changes in infant mortality from 2010 to 2011
 were statistically significant. With the exception of 2002, the infant mortality rate has statistically remained the same or decreased significantly each successive year from 1958 through 2011
 (1,12). The neonatal (i.e., infants under age 28 days) mortality rate was 4.04 per 1,000 live births in 2011,
 which also was not significantly different
 from 2010. The postneonatal (i.e., infants aged 28 daysŒ11
 months) mortality rate decreased by 4.3 percent from 2.10 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2010 to 2.01 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2011.
 Infant mortality did not change significantly from 2010 to 2011
 for either black or white infants. The mortality rate of 11.42
 deaths per 1,000 live births for black infants was 2.2 times the rate of 5.11
 deaths per 1,000 live births for white infants (Tables
 A and 4). Because of inconsistencies in the reporting of race groups on birth and death certificates (especially for races other than white and black and for Hispanic origin), infant mortality rates for these groups are likely to be underestimated (4). The linked birth/infant death data set provides a better source of data for infant deaths and mortality rates by maternal race and ethnicity (13). Although the infant mortality rate is the preferred indicator of the risk of dying during the first year of life, the infant death rate is also shown in this report. While similar,
 these two rates vary based on differences
 in their denominators. The denominator of the 2011
 infant death rate is the estimated population under age 1 year as of the reference date, July 1, 2011
 (14). This population estimate includes a combination of infants born in 2010 who had not reached their first birthday before July 1, 2011,
 and infants born in 2011
 before July 1, 2011.
 In contrast, the denominator of the 2011
 infant mortality rate is all live births occurring during 2011
 (15). For example, the preliminary number of live births for 2011
 (n = 3,953,593) is 1.1 percent lower than the July 1 infant population in 2011
 (n = 3,996,537). Therefore, the infant mortality rate for 2011
 (604.7 deaths per 100,000 live births) is higher than the infant death rate for 2011
 (598.3 deaths per 100,000 population). For 2011,
 only the infant death rate decreased significantly from 2010. The 10 leading causes of infant mortality for 2011
 were: 1. Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities 2. Disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified 3. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) 4. Newborn affected
 by maternal complications of pregnancy 5. Accidents (unintentional injuries) 6. Newborn affected
 by complications of placenta, cord and membranes 7. Bacterial sepsis of newborn 8. Respiratory distress of newborn 9. Diseases of the circulatory system 10. Neonatal hemorrhage The leading causes of infant death in 2011
 were the same as in 2009. They were the same as in 2010 for 9 of the 10 leading causes (Table
 8). Dropping from among the 10 leading causes of infant death in 2011
 was Necrotizing enterocolitis of newborn, replaced by Neonatal hemorrhage as the 10th leading cause of infant death in 2011.
 The infant mortality rate decreased for only 1 of the 10 leading causes of death from 2010 to 2011
 (Tables
 5 and 8). The infant mortality rate decreased by 16.1 percent for SIDS (Tables
 5 and 8). Deaths due to SIDS, currently the third leading cause of infant death, have been declining since 1988 (1,16). Because SIDS deaths often involve lengthy investigations, the mortality rate due to SIDS is typically lower based on preliminary data than that based on the final data. Recent declines in mortality due to SIDS also may reflect a change in the way SIDS is diagnosed and reported by medical iners and coroners (17). References 1.Miniño AM, Murphy SL, Xu JQ, Kochanek KD.

 1. Deaths and death rates, by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, and age-adjusted death rates, by sex, race, and Hispanic origin: United States, final 2010 and preliminary 2011ŠCon.
 [Data are based on a continuous file of records received from the states. Age-specific rates are per 100,000 population in specified group. Age-adjusted
 rates are per 100,000 U.S. standard population; see Technical
 Notes. Figures for 2011
 are based on weighted data rounded to the nearest individual, so categories may not add
 to totals. Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the death certificate. Data for Hispanic origin and specified races other than white and black should be interpreted
 with caution because of inconsistencies between reporting Hispanic origin and race on death certificates and on censuses and surveys; see Technical
 Notes. Race categories
 are consistent with the 1977 Office
 of Management and Budget (OMB) standards. Multiple-race data were reported by 38 states and the District of Columbia in
 2011
 and by 37 states and the District of Columbia in 2010; see Technical
 Notes. The multiple-race data for these states were bridged to the single-race categories of
 the 1977 OMB standards for comparability with other states; see Technical
 Notes. Data for persons of Hispanic origin are included in the data for each race group, according
 to the decedent™s
 reported race; see Technical

 Notes.NOTES: For certain causes of death such as unintentional injuries, homicides, sudden infant death syndrome, and respiratory diseases, preliminary and final data differ
 because of the random variation. For information regarding the calculation of standard errors and further discussion of the variability of the data, see Technical
 Notes. Although the infant mortality rate another measure of infant mortality,
 the infant death rate, is shown elsewhere in this report. The two measures typically are similar,
 yet they can differ
 because the denominators used of risk, see ‚‚Infant

 Notes. truncated nature of the preliminary file. Data are subject to sampling or is the preferred indicator of the risk of dying during the first year of life, for these measures are different.

 6. Expectation of life at selected ages, by race, Hispanic origin, race for non-Hispanic population, and sex: United States, final 2010 and preliminary 2011
 [Data are based on a continuous file of records from the states. Calculations of life expectancy employ populations estimated as of July 1 for 2011
 and April
 1 for 2010; see Technical
 Notes. Race categories are consistent with the 1977 Office
 of Management and Budget (OMB) standards. Multiple-race data were reported by 38
 states and the District of Columbia in 2011
 and by 37 states and the District of Columbia in 2010; see Technical
 Notes. The multiple-race data for these states were bridged
 to the single-race categories of the 1977 OMB standards for comparability with other states; see Technical
 Notes. Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately
 on the death certificate. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. Data for Hispanic persons are not tabulated separately by race; data for non-Hispanic persons
 are tabulated by race; see Technical
 Notes. The methodology used to produce life expectancies adjusts for misclassification for Hispanic and for race and ethnicity for
 the non-Hispanic populations (see ‚‚Life
 tables™™
 in Technical
 Notes). Adjustments do not account for other sources of error such as return migration (37)] Both sexes Male Female Age in years, and race 2011

 6. Expectation of life at selected ages, by race, Hispanic origin, race for non-Hispanic population, and sex: United States, final 2010 and preliminary 2011ŠCon.
 [Data are based on a continuous file of records from the states. Calculations of life expectancy employ populations estimated as of July 1 for 2011
 and April
 1 for 2010; see Technical
 Notes. Race categories are consistent with the 1977 Office
 of Management and Budget (OMB) standards. Multiple-race data were reported by 38
 states and the District of Columbia in 2011
 and by 37 states and the District of Columbia in 2010; see Technical
 Notes. The multiple-race data for these states were bridged
 to the single-race categories of the 1977 OMB standards for comparability with other states; see Technical
 Notes. Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately
 on the death certificate. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. Data for Hispanic persons are not tabulated separately by race; data for non-Hispanic persons
 are tabulated by race; see Technical
 Notes. The methodology used to produce life expectancies adjusts for misclassification for Hispanic and for race and ethnicity for
 the non-Hispanic populations (see ‚‚Life
 tables™™
 in Technical
 Notes). Adjustments do not account for other sources of error such as return migration (37)] Both sexes Male Female Age in years, and race Non-Hispanic white 0 ....................... 1 ....................... 5 ....................... 10.......................

 the infant death rate, is shown elsewhere in thereport. The two measures typically are similar,
 yet they can differ
 because the denominators used for these measures are different.
 34 National Vital
 Statistics Reports, Vol.
 61, No. 6, October 10, 2012 Technical
 Notes Nature and sources of data Preliminary mortality data for 2011
 are based on a continuous receipt and processing of statistical records by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention™s National Center for Health Statis˜tics (NCHS) through June 12, 2012. NCHS received the data from the states™ vital registration systems through the Vital
 Statistics Cooperative Program. Demographic information for the United States was available in calendar year 2011
 for an estimated 98.9 percent of infant decedents and 99.4 percent of decedents aged 1 year and over.
 Medical information for the United States was available in calendar year 2011
 for an estimated 97.3 percent of infant decedents and 98.1 percent of decedents aged 1 year and over.
 In this report, U.S. totals include only events occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.). Data for Puerto Rico, the Virgin
 Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas included in tables showing data by state are not included in U.S. totals. Additional information on 2010 final data is available elsewhere (3). For 2011,
 individual records of infant deaths (deaths under age 1 year) and deaths of persons aged 1 year and over are weighted (when necessary) to independent counts of deaths occurring in each state. These state-specific counts serve as control totals and are the basis for the record weights in the preliminary file. If the number of records in the preliminary file is greater than the count received from the state, the state-specific number of records in the preliminary file is used instead and the weight is set at 1.0. For this report, two separate files are processed. The medical file, or cause of death file, contains records that include both demographic and medical information used to generate tables showing cause of death. The demographic file, which includes records from the medical file as well as additional records containing demographic information only,
 is used to generate tables showing mortality by demographic characteristics only.
 A state-specific weight is computed for each file by dividing the state control total by the number of records in the pre˜liminary sample. Each record is assigned two weights, a state-specific weight and a U.S. weight. State weights are used for state-specific tabulations and U.S. weights are used for national tabulations. For the medical file, the state weight makes the death counts comparable with those in the demographic file. The U.S. weight combines two factors: one to make the medical file counts for the individual record™s state comparable with those for the demographic file, and one to compensate for any states not represented in the file. This second factor is equivalent to 0 if all states are represented in the file. Thus, when all states are represented in the preliminary files, the state and U.S. weights are the same. Because there are two separate files, each with two separate sets of weights, slight inconsistencies may occur between the demographic and medical tables in this report. Table
 I shows the percent complete˜ness of the preliminary files by place of occurrence for the United States and each state. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of records in the preliminary files by the control total and multiplying by 100. Although data by place of occurrence are used to compute the weights, all data in this report are tabulated by place of residence. For selected variables in the mortality files, unknown or not stated values are imputed. The percentage not stated was less than 0.3 per˜cent for all variables discussed in this report. Detailed information on how the file addresses not stated values for specific variables (race, Hispanic origin, sex, and age) may be found in ‚‚Technical

 that implemented the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death by 2011,
 and the remaining 14 states that collected and reported death data in 2011
 based on the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death. Minnesota implemented the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death in March 2011,
 so a portion of this state™s data for 2011
 was reported using the 1989 revision. The 2003 revision is described in detail elsewhere (19,20). Because the items presented in this report appear largely comparable despite changes to item wording and format in the 2003 revision, data from both groups of states are combined. Race and Hispanic origin The 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death allows the reporting of more than one race (multiple races) (19). This change was implemented to reflect the increasing diversity of the population of the United States, to be consistent with the decennial census, and to reflect standards issued in 1997 by the Office
 of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB standards mandate the collection of more than one race for federal data (see ‚‚Population
 denominators™™)
 (21). In addition, the new certificate is compliant with the OMB-mandated minimum set of five races to be reported for federal data. These are white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI). For 2011
 mortality data, multiple races were reported on the revised death certificates of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
 Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mon˜tana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
 New Mexico, New York
 (including New York
 City), North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas,
 Utah, Vermont,
 Washington,
 and Wyoming.
 Multiple races were also reported on the unrevised certificates of Hawaii and Wisconsin. Data from the vital records of the remaining 12 states are based on the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death, which follows the 1977 OMB standards, allowing only a single race to be reported (20,22). In addition, these 12 states report a minimum set of four races as stipulated in the 1977 standards. These are white, black or African American, AIAN, and Asian or Pacific Islander (API). According to the 2010 final mortality file, 0.4 percent of deaths were reported to persons of more than one race. To
 provide uniformity and comparability of data during the tran˜sition period, before all or most of the data become available in the new multiple race format, it is necessary to adjust the data for those  35 National Vital

 Statistics Reports, Vol.
 61, No. 6, October 10, 2012 states reporting multiple race by ‚‚bridging™™
 the multiple-race informa˜tion reported for decedents to a single race. The bridging procedure used for mortality numerators is similar to the procedure used to bridge multiracial population estimates (see ‚‚Population
 denominators™™)
 (23,24). Multiracial decedents are imputed to a single race (either white, black, AIAN, or API) according to the combination of races, Hispanic origin, sex, and age indicated on the death certificate. The imputation procedure is described in detail at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/
 Multiple_race_docu_5-10-04.pdf. Because race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the death certificate, data shown by race include persons of Hispanic or non-Hispanic origin, and data for Hispanic origin include persons of any race. In this report, unless otherwise specified, deaths of persons of Hispanic origin are included in the totals for each race groupŠwhite, black, AIAN, and APIŠaccording to the decedent™s race as reported on the death certificate. Data shown for Hispanic persons include all persons of Hispanic origin of any race. Mortality data on the Hispanic origin population are based on deaths in all states. Death rates for Hispanic, AIAN, and API persons should be interpreted with caution because of inconsistencies in reporting race on death certificates compared with such reporting on censuses, surveys, and birth cer˜tificates. Studies have shown underreporting on death certificates of AIAN, API, and Hispanic decedents, as well as undercounts of these groups in censuses (4Œ6). Injury at work Information on deaths attributed to injuries at work is derived from a separate item on the death certificate that asks the medical certifier whether the death resulted from an injury sustained at work. The item is on the death certificate of all states. Number of deaths, crude death rates, and age-adjusted death rates for injury at work for those aged 15 and over,
 excluding age not stated, are shown in Table
 2. Age-adjusted death rates presented in this report for injury at work were computed using age-specific death rates and the U.S. standard population based on year 2000 standard for ages 15 years and over,
 excluding age not stated (Table
 V). If the estimated ‚‚employed™™
 population aged 15 and over had been used instead in the denominator,
 higher death rates would have resulted, especially for population groups with lower employment rates. See ‚‚Computing
 rates and percentages.™™
 The number of deaths from injury at work from the National Vital
 Statistics System is generally about 10 percent less than the counts in the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (http://www.bls.gov/iif
/) between 1993 and 2011.
 The Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries uses multiple source documents, while the National Vital
 Statistics System uses the death certificate only.
 Cause-of-death classification Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World
 Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that member nations classify and code causes of death in accordance with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, and Related Health Problems (ICD). The ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury,
 and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on the use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines which are described in annual issues of part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (25). Effective
 with deaths occurring in 1999, the United States began using the Tenth
 Revision of the ICD (ICDŒ10) (26Œ27). For earlier years, causes of death were classified according to the revisions then in use (3). An innovation in ICDŒ10 is that the classification is updated between revisions (27). Changes associated with these updates are discussed in the Technical
 Notes of each annual report (1Œ3,8,16). Beginning with data for 2001, NCHS introduced categories *U01Œ*U03 for classifying and coding deaths due to acts of terrorism. The asterisks before the category codes indicate that they are not part of ICDŒ10. Deaths classified to the terrorism categories are included in the categories Assault (homicide) and Intentional self-harm (suicide) for the 113
 causes-of-death list (Table
 2) and Assault (homicide) in the 130 causes-of-infant death list (Table
 5). Additional information on the new terrorism categories can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
 icd/terrorism_code.htm. No deaths occurring in 2010 and 2011
 were classified to the terrorism categories. Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)ŠDue to growing concerns about the number of deaths from Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile (ICDŒ10 code A04.7), beginning in 2006, C. difficile deaths are included separately as a rankable cause of death in tables showing data for 113
 selected causes of death (Table
 2). Codes for drug-induced deathsŠThe list of codes included in drug-induced causes was expanded in data years 2003 and 2006 to be more comprehensive. The following ICDŒ10 codes comprise the list of drug-induced codes: D52.1, D59.0, D59.2, D61.1, D64.2, E06.4, E16.0, E23.1, E24.2, E27.3, E66.1, F11.0ŒF11.5,
 F11.7ŒF11.9,
 F12.0ŒF12.5, F12.7ŒF12.9, F13.0ŒF13.5, F13.7ŒF13.9, F14.0ŒF14.5, F14.7ŒF14.9, F15.0ŒF15.5, F15.7ŒF15.9, F16.0ŒF16.5, F16.7ŒF16.9, F17.0, F17.3ŒF17.5, F17.7ŒF17.9, F18.0ŒF18.5, F18.7Œ18.9, F19.0ŒF19.5, F19.7ŒF19.9, G21.1, G24.0, G25.1, G25.4, G25.6, G44.4, G62.0, G72.0, I95.2, J70.2ŒJ70.4, K85.3, L10.5, L27.0ŒL27.1, M10.2, M32.0, M80.4, M81.4, M83.5, M87.1, R50.2, R78.1ŒR78.5, X40ŒX44, X60ŒX64, X85, and Y10Œ14. Codes for alcohol-induced deathsŠThe list of codes included in alcohol-induced causes was expanded in data years 2003 and 2006 to be more comprehensive. The following ICDŒ10 codes comprise the list of alcohol-induced codes: E24.4, F10, G31.2, G62.1, G72.1, I42.6, K29.2, K70, K85.2, K86.0, R78.0, X45, X65, and Y15. Recently deleted and added codesŠRules governing coding and classifying the causes of death sometimes require modifications as part of the updating process of ICDŒ10; this includes adding and deleting codes (3). Each modification may be done for a different
 reason. For example, subcategories were created for existing code X34 (Victim
 of earthquake) to provide detail, specifically in response to a desire to distinguish victims of events such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami from other kinds of earthquake-related events. Changes to N18 were made to reflect a more contemporary classification scheme for Chronic kidney disease that incorporated diagnosed stages of the disease. Additional detail on the updates can be found at http:// www.who.int/classifications/icd/icd10updates/en/index.html
. These changes may affect
 comparability of data between years for selected causes of death. With the mentioned examples, statistics for victims  37 National Vital
 Statistics Reports, Vol.
 61, No. 6, October 10, 2012 of earthquake were not affected
 by changes in the codes but the statistics on kidney and renal conditions were. The impact on kidney and renal conditions is discussed below.

Additional information on these new categories can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/
 dvs/Part9InstructionManual2011.pdf
 (28). Changes to classification affecting renal failureŠIn 2011,
 the implementation of changes in coding rules had an impact on Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis (ICDŒ10 codes N00ŒN07, N17ŒN19, and N25ŒN27) and therefore, changes in mortality statistics for this condition must be interpreted with caution. Renal failure (N17ŒN19) is a component condition of the larger category Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis. The changes associate renal failure with other diseases such as diabetes, wasting, and paralyzing con˜ditions in more cases than in the past. For instance, both diabetes and kidney conditions were reported on about 2 percent of death certificates in 2010 and 2011.
 Compared with 2010, the percentage of these with an underlying cause of Nepritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis decreased while the percentage with an underlying cause of Diabetes mellitus increased in 2011,
 especially diabetes mellitus with renal complications (data not shown). Nonsampling error Causes of death in this report are subject to nonsampling error.
 This is because the preliminary file is processed before a full year™s worth of data are available. The file is thus subject to the seasonality of certain causes of death that may not be equally distributed throughout the year.
 It is known, for example, that external causes such as unintentional injuries occur disproportionately during the summer months, and that fatal respiratory conditions are more prevalent during the winter months. Accordingly,
 the truncated nature of the preliminary file may systematically overemphasize or underem˜phasize causes with pronounced seasonality,
 particularly when these deaths cluster at the end of the year.
 However,
 in years where the preliminary file completeness is more than 90 percent, it is unlikely that seasonality is a major factor; the 2011
 preliminary file is more than 98 percent complete. Furthermore, for some deaths, especially those subject to medi˜colegal investigation such as unintentional injuries, homicides, suicides, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the final cause may not be available at the time the preliminary file is processed. In those cases, the causes of death may be reported in the preliminary file as unknown or pending investigation and coded to the category Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality (ICDŒ10 code R99), a subcategory of Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified (ICDŒ10 codes R00ŒR99). In the final data, some of the deaths of unknown cause in the preliminary file will be reassigned to specific causes if further,
 more specific cause-of-death information is provided.  38 National Vital
 Statistics Reports, Vol.
 61, No. 6, October 10, 2012 A quantitative assessment of the degree of the nonsampling error can be made by comparing final data and preliminary data for the same year.
 A comparison of such data for the selected 113
 causes of death for the total U.S. population from 2008Œ2010 indicates that preliminary estimates for some causes of death are sometimes underestimated and sometimes overestimated in the preliminary file (Table
 II). Thus, the number of deaths for unintentional injuries (V01ŒX59, Y85ŒY86) was underestimated in the preliminary file by 0.6 percent in 2008, 0.7 per˜cent in 2009, and 2.3 percent in 2010. Similar undercounts occurred for suicide (*U03, X60ŒX84, Y87.0) with preliminary underestimates of 0.3 percent in 2008, 1.0 percent in 2009, and 1.5 percent in 2010. Likewise, homicide (*U01Œ*U02, X85ŒY09, Y87.1) showed a 1.2 per˜cent underestimate in the preliminary file in 2009 and 2010, but a 0.1 overestimate in 2008. Comparisons showing nonsampling error in preliminary estimates for causes of infant death are shown in Table
 III, where Disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified (P07) was underestimated by 0.4 percent in 2008, 1.7 percent in 2009, and 0.4 percent in 2010. Unintentional injuries (V01ŒX59) and SIDS (R95) were underestimated in the preliminary data for each of the three years from 2008Œ2010 with unintentional injuries being underestimated between 1.2 percent and 6.0 percent, and SIDS between 2.6 percent and 8.4 percent (Table
 III). Tabulation

 Mortality Statistics, Updated March 2011™™
 (28). For this report, two tabulation lists are used: the List of 113
 Selected Causes of Death used for deaths of all ages, and the List of 130 Selected Causes of Infant Death used for infants. Modifications in the lists reflecting changes in ICD codes are footnoted in the report tables. These lists are also used to rank leading causes of death for the two population groups (29). For the List of 113
 Selected Causes of Death, the group titles Major cardiovascular diseases (ICDŒ10 codes I00ŒI78) and Symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified (ICDŒ10 codes R00ŒR99) are not ranked. In addition, category titles that begin with the words ‚‚Other™™
 and ‚‚All
 other™™
 are not ranked to determine the leading causes of death. When one of the titles that represents a subtotal is ranked [for example, Tuberculosis
 (ICDŒ10 codes A16ŒA19)], its component parts are not ranked [in this case, Respiratory tuberculosis (ICDŒ10 code A16) and Other tuberculosis (ICDŒ10 codes A17ŒA19)]. For the List of 130 Selected Causes of Infant Death, the same ranking procedures are used, except that the category Major cardiovascular diseases is not on the list. Infant mortality The infant mortality rate is the most commonly used index for measuring the risk of dying during the first year of life. The rates presented in this report are calculated by dividing the preliminary number of infant deaths that occurred during 2011
 by the number of live births for the same period and are presented as rates per 1,000 or per 100,000 live births. For preliminary birth figures used in the denominator for infant mortality rates, see ‚‚Births:
 Preliminary Data for 2011™™
 (15). In contrast to infant mortality rates based on live births, infant death rates are based on the estimated population under age 1 year (Table
 1). Infant death rates that appear in tabulations of age-specific death rates in this report are calculated by dividing the number of infant deaths in 2011
 by the estimated population of persons under age 1 on July 1, 2011,
 and are presented as rates per 100,000 population in this age group. Because of differences
 in their denominators, infant death rates may differ
 from infant mortality rates. Information on infant deaths can also be obtained from a file where the infant™s death certificate is linked to the birth certificate. The linked birth/infant death data set (linked file) is a better source of data for infant deaths and mortality rates by race and ethnicity because the race of the mother as reported by the mother on the birth certificate is used in both the numerator and denominator of the infant mortality rate. In contrast, for infant deaths and mortality rates in this report, race information for the denominator is the race of the mother as reported on the birth certificate, but the race information for the numerator is the race of the infant decedent as reported on the death certificate. Race information reported on the birth certificate is considered to be more accurate than that on the death certificate, because the race of each parent is usually reported on the birth certificate by the mother at the time of delivery,
 whereas on the death certificate, the race of the deceased infant is reported by the funeral director based on information provided by an informant or by observation. This difference
 in the method of reporting race data has a larger impact for races other than white and black and can lead to differences
 in race-specific infant mortality rates between the two data sources (13). Life tables The period life table provides a measure of the effect
 of current mortality on life expectancy.
 It is composed of sets of values showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime to the age-specific death rates of a particular time period, usually a given year.
 Beginning with final data for 1997, complete life tables by single years through age 100 have been constructed for the preliminary report (30). Beginning with the 2008 life tables, the methodology used to construct life tables was revised from methods used in earlier reports (30Œ35). The most recent revised methodology is described in greater detail in ‚‚United
 States Life Tables,
 2008™™
 (7). NCHS began producing life tables for the 2006 data year by Hispanic origin after conducting research into the quality of race and ethnicity reporting on death certificates and developing methodologies to correct for misclassification of these populations on death certificates (36,37). Previously,
 NCHS produced annual life tables by race including the white and black populations but had not produced life tables for other racial or ethnic groups. The methods that adjust for misclassi˜fication are applied to the production of the life tables, but not to the death rates shown in this report. The life expectancy data shown in this report for the 2006Œ2009 data year have been updated using intercensal population estimates and may differ
 from those published previously (1,2,8). Population denominators The rates in this report for 2011
 use population estimates as of July 1, 2011.
 The rates for 2010 use population enumerated based on the 2010 census as of April 1, 2010. These population estimates  39 Table

 Statistics Reports, Vol.
 61, No. 6, October 10, 2012 are available on the NCHS website (14). The production of these population estimates is described in detail elsewhere (23). Rates for Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Virgin
 Islands in this report are based on population estimates as of July 1 for 2010 and 2011.
 These population estimates are available on the Census Bureau™s website at http:// www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/region.php
. The population estimates have been produced under a collab˜orative arrangement with the U.S. Census Bureau and are based on the 2010 census counts. Reflecting the new standards issued in 1997 by OMB, the 2010 census included an option for persons to report more than one race as appropriate for themselves and household members (21). In addition, the 1997 OMB standards called for reporting of Asian persons separately from NHOPI. In the 1977 OMB standards, data for API persons were collected as a single group (22). Death certificates for 12 states currently collect only one race in the same categories as specified in the 1977 OMB standards (see ‚‚2003
 revision of U.S. Standard Certificate of Death™™).
 In addition, those death certificate data do not report Asian persons separately from NHOPI. Thus, for nearly one-quarter of the states, the death certificate data by race (numerators for death rates) are incompatible with population data collected in the 2010 census (the denominators for the rates). To
 produce national death rates for 2010 and 2011,
 the reported population data for multiple-race persons had to be ‚‚bridged™™
 back to single-race categories. In addition, the census counts were modified to be consistent with the 1977 OMB racial categories; that is, to report the data for Asian persons and NHOPI as one combined category,
 API, and to reflect age as of the census reference date. The procedures used to produce the bridged populations are described in separate publi˜cations (23,24). Bridged data are anticipated to be used over the next few years for computing population-based rates. As more states collect data on race according to the 1997 OMB standards (21), use of the bridged populations is expected to be discontinued. Computing rates and percentages Death rates are on an annual basis per 100,000 estimated population residing in the specified area. Infant mortality rates are per 1,000 or per 100,000 live births. Age-adjusted death rates (R) are used to compare relative mor˜tality risks among groups and over time; however,
 they should be viewed as relative indexes rather than as actual measures of mortality risk. They were computed by the direct method; that is, by applying age-specific death rates (Ri) to the U.S. standard population (relative age distribution of year 2000 projected population of the United States); see the following formula for age-adjusted death rate, and the table of U.S. standard population (Table
 IV): Owhere Psi = standard population for age group iPs = total U.S. standard population [all ages combined (Table
 IV)].˚ Age-adjusted death rates for injury at work were computed by applying the age-specific death rates to the U.S. standard population PsiR = Ri ,Ps i Table

 The year 2000 standard population used for computing age-adjusted rates and standard errors for injury at work is shown in Table
 V. Age-adjusted rates for Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Virgin
 Islands were computed by applying age-specific death rates to the U.S. standard population. The year 2000 standard population used for computing age-adjusted rates for the territories is shown in Table
 IV. Effective
 with 1999 data, the standard population was changed from 1940 to the year 2000 population in accordance with the new statistical policy promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in August 1998 (38). The transition in standard population is described in greater detail in ‚‚Deaths:
 Final Data for 2010™™
 (3). Death rates for the Hispanic population are based only on events to persons reported as Hispanic. Rates for non-Hispanic white persons are based on the sum of all events to white decedents reported as non-Hispanic and white decedents with origin not stated. Likewise, rates for non-Hispanic black persons are based on the sum of all events to black decedents reported as non-Hispanic and black decedents with origin not stated. Hispanic origin is not imputed if it is not reported. Race not stated is imputed. For calculating death rates, deaths with age not stated are not distributed. The number of deaths with age not stated in 2011
 was 132, approximately 0.005 percent of all deaths. For statistics shown in the body of tables throughout this report, an asterisk (*) indicates that the figure does not meet standards of reliability or precision. In this report, two sets of criteria determine whether a figure meets these standards: +Reporting for any particular variable is at least 80 percent com˜plete. In this report, no data were suppressed based on this criterion. Table

 Statistics Reports, Vol.
 61, No. 6, October 10, 2012 +A rate or percentage is based on at least 20 deaths. Rates based on fewer than 20 deaths have a relative standard error (RSE) of about 23 percent or more and, therefore, are considered highly variable. For age-adjusted death rates, this criterion is applied to the sum of the age-specific deaths; however,
 some death rates (based on data files that are less than 100 percent complete and on 20Œ31 deaths) may have RSEs of 23 percent or more but are still shown instead of asterisks. As a result, caution should be exercised in analyzing rates based on 20Œ31 events. Additional information on random variation in numbers of events, rates, ratios, and percentages may be found in ‚‚Reliability
 of estimates.™™
 Reliability of estimates Because the preliminary estimates of deaths in this report are based on files that may not be complete, they are subject to sampling variability.
 This concept is reflected in the fact that record weights are used to adjust record counts to independent control totals. The lack of completeness of the vital statistics files is due to delays in receiving and processing the death records. Although the proportion of records making up the preliminary file does not constitute a veritable random sample, for the sake of convenience the variability associated with this error (sampling variability) is treated as if it were from a random sample. Even where the number of vital events in this report is 100 percent complete and not subject to sampling variability,
 it might be affected
 by random variation. Thus, when the number of events is small and the probability of such an event is small, considerable caution must be observed in interpreting the data. Such infrequent events may be assumed to follow a Poisson probability distribution. The first column of Table
 VI shows the estimated RSEs of a file that is nearly 100 percent complete. Data in a file that is less than 100 percent complete are affected
 by sampling variation as well as by random variation. The estimated RSEs in columns 2Œ6 of Table
 VI for various levels of file completeness are measures of the sampling errors and the random errors of the estimates. They do not include nonsampling error.
 The estimated RSEs in Table
 VI were computed using: where Œf== the sampling fraction or the percent of file completeness/100 from Table

 for either the demographic or medical files as appropriate. X = the estimated number of infant deaths or deaths. N = total count of infant deaths or deaths for the United States or any state. (NOTE: RSEs shown in Table
 VI are based on N = 4,000,000. If N is smaller,
 the RSEs may be slightly smaller than those shown.) RSEs may be used to compute 95 percent confidence intervals for the number of events (X), for a rate (R), or for a percentage (P) and to compute statistical tests concerning the equality of two rates (R1 and R2) or two percentages (P1 and P2). For the number of deaths, the 95 percent confidence interval may be computed as: As a hypothetical example, assume the number of deaths, X1,is
 70 from a file with 80 percent completeness. Then, (13.4 Lower limit: 70 Œ 1.96 c 70 c = 51.6 100 ) 13.4 Upper limit: 70 + (1.96 c 70 c ) = 88.4 . 100This means that the chances are 95 times out of 100 that the confidence interval (51.6Œ88.4) will cover the ‚‚true™™
 number of deaths. For rates based on population estimates in the denominator,
 the 95 percent confidence interval may be computed as: As a hypothetical example, assume the death rate, R1, is 20.0, which is based on 70 deaths from a file with 80 percent complete˜ness. Then, 13.4 Lower limit: 20.0 Œ (1.96 c 20.0 c 100) = 14.7 13.4 Upper limit: 20.0 + (1.96 c 20.0 c ) = 25.3 . 100This means that the chances are 95 times out of 100 that the confidence interval (14.7Œ25.3) will cover the ‚‚true™™

 Xthi = the estimated number of deaths for the i age group. Ni = total count of deaths from Table
 I for each ith age group (for infant deaths, use the count of records as shown; for all age groups 1Œ4 through 85 years and over,
 use the count of records as shown for deaths 1 year and over). fi =˛ percentage of file completeness/100 from Table
 I (for infant deaths, use the percent completeness for the demographic or medical file as appropriate for deaths under age 1 year; for all age groups 1Œ4 through 85 years and over,
 use the percent completeness for the demographic or medical file as appropriate for deaths at ages 1 year and over). For testing the equality of two rates, R1 and R2, the following z test may be used to define a significance test statistic: The two-tailed 0.95 critical value for a z statistic is 1.96. Therefore, if ?z?  1.96, the difference
 is significant at the 0.05 level. If ?z? < 1.96, then the difference
 would be considered not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. As a hypothetical example, assume R1 is the same as the above example for the current 12-month period and that R2, 15.0, is based on 50 deaths occurring in the prior 12-month period (which implies that the file is approximately 100 percent complete for R2). The z test may be determined as: 20.0 Œ15.0 z =˛ Œ=1.46.

 + (15.0)100 (100 )Because ?z? < 1.96, there is no statistically significant difference
 between the two rates at the 0.05 level of significance. For rates or percentages based on denominators having random variation only or random and sampling variation, the RSE must take into account the variation in both the numerator and denominator.
 For example, for a rate, R3, based on the number of live births in the denominator,
 the RSE is computed as: R1Œ R29. z = Œ. (RSE(R1)100(RR ) 2RSE(2 2 2)21+ R 2100 ) 51 National Vital
