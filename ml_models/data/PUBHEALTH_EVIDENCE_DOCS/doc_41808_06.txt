 Close           ×Close Downloading and Using eBooks from NAP   What is an eBook?
 An ebook is one of two file formats that are intended to be used with e-reader devices and apps such as Amazon Kindle or Apple iBooks.
 Why is an eBook better than a PDF?
 A PDF is a digital representation of the print book, so while it can be loaded into most e-reader programs, it doesn't allow for resizable text or advanced, interactive functionality.
 The eBook is optimized for e-reader devices and apps, which means that it offers a much better digital reading experience than a PDF, including resizable text and interactive features (when available).
 Where do I get eBook files?
 eBook files are now available for a large number of reports on the NAP.edu website.
 If an eBook is available, you'll see the option to purchase it on the book page.

 Reports typically include findings, conclusions, and recommendations based on information gathered by the committee and the committee’s deliberations.
 Each report has been subjected to a rigorous and independent peer-review process and it represents the position of the National Academies on the statement of task.
 Close            Overview Resources Rights Stats        Overview    Contributors  Institute of Medicine; Board on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention; Immunization Safety Review Committee   Description This eighth and final report of the Immunization Safety Review Committee examines the hypothesis that vaccines, specifically the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and thimerosal-containing vaccines, are causally associated with autism.
 The committee reviewed the extant published and unpublished epidemiological studies regarding causality and studies of potential biologic mechanisms by which these immunizations might cause autism.
 Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines and Autism finds that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.
 The book further finds that potential biological mechanisms for vaccine-induced autism that have been generated to date are only theoretical.
 It recommends a public health response that fully supports an array of vaccine safety activities and recommends that available funding for autism research be channeled to the most promising areas.
 The book makes additional recommendations regarding surveillance and epidemiological research, clinical studies, and communication related to these vaccine safety concerns.
