 For almost 10 years, SaleTaxSupport.com was the go-to “sales tax” web-site, where small-medium businesses could easily find over 1,000 pages of sales tax information, as well as solution and service providers.
 (This past year alone, we had approximately 500,000 users generate 1,000,000 page views!)
 Unfortunately, due to changes in the market (as well as our personal lives), we have decided that it is no longer possible to host the site in its current format.
 However, in order to assist you - we have provided links (below) to some of the sales tax professionals who provided our most popular content.
 If you visit their linked web-sites, you will find helpful information, as well as contact options.
 We thank you for your support – and wish you (and your business) well!
