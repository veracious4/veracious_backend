 Image may contain: text that says 'ATTENTION just left CVS on Rock Creek Dairy Rd in Whitsett where I saw a young lady get out of this man's car.
 The man was a white male, 50s/60s and wore a baseball cap.
 I noticed her because when she got out out the car she seemed discombobulated, her pants were falling down and I was able to see her underwear but she didn't seem bothered by that.
 She was a black female with a short curly blondish fro, tall and slender.
 It was placed in my spirit to go back into the store'.
