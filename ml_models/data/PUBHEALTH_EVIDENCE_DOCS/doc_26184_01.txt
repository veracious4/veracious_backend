It‚Äôs the perfect story for a certain type of ideologue.
 It‚Äôs also apparently false.
 The claim seems to have originated on Reddit, the massively popular message board, due to someone sniffing around some (admittedly confusing) numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 It then spread around social media.
 COVID-19 may be under control in Florida but they have an unprecedented ‚Äúpneumonia‚Äù crisis.‚Äî Andy Slavitt @ üè° (@ASlavitt)      May 29, 2020      Andy Slavitt, a former healthcare executive-turned-Obama administration official, has since taken down his post citing the misleading numbers from Reddit.
 But he hasn't retracted the claim that Florida has a "pneumonia" crisis, with pneumonia in scare quotes.
 Folks who believed Republican openers would cause mass death are hanging on to that idea desperately.
 This is the result of amateur "online instant-experts" comparing two different data sets.
 Pneumonia is a lethal complication caused by other diseases.
 AIDS and the flu both cause people to die from pneumonia, as do many other infections.
 In fact, if you look at any official data on ‚Äúflu deaths,‚Äù you‚Äôre really looking at data on ‚Äúpneumonia and influenza mortality.‚Äù Folks dying from the coronavirus are also typically being killed by pneumonia, a clogged-lung condition that is caused by the virus.
 Sometimes, "pneumonia" is given as someone's singular, underlying cause of death.
 But much more often it is listed as one cause among many.
 Each of these numbers is counted separately by health officials.
 The Reddit post that has fooled people into thinking there's a Florida cover-up confuses these two counts.
 For past years, it looks at how often pneumonia was listed as the sole cause of death, coming up with a number that is relatively small.
 For this year, on the other hand, it uses the number of deaths for which pneumonia is a cause but maybe not the cause.
 That number is much larger because it isn't comparable.
 Daniel Bier makes it clear:     Neither of you know what you're talking about.You are comparing two different measures of "pneumonia &amp; influenza" deaths: p&amp;i as *the* singular "underlying" cause of death (UCD) and p&amp;i as *a* multiple cause of death MCD.CDC's real time FluView tracker &gt; MCD &gt; UCD, *always*.
 pic.twitter.com/SNg7Kw3FLR‚Äî Daniel Bier (@FT__Dan)      May 27, 2020      That blue line in the graph shows pneumonia as the sole underlying cause of death.
 The red line is the count of how many deaths included pneumonia as one of multiple causes of death.
 So, what we have here is an inapt comparison.
 If you count deaths in Florida this year attributed solely to pneumonia, you will naturally find that number to be a small fraction of the number of deaths in Florida in past years attributed to pneumonia and other causes.
 And of course, the reverse is the case as well.
 The comparison is worthless unless you‚Äôre trying to score cheap political points, and even then, as with all internet hoaxes, it only works until people figure it out.

 Media declare themselves the real heroes of the Trump era    Becket Adams   Monday November 09, 2020        No institution in the world is more heroic than the media, according to the media.
 Stock market surge doesn't have much to do with Biden vs. Trump    Tim Worstall   Monday November 09, 2020        It's possible to put a little too much weight on the importance of politics, as the BBC does when it tells us that stock markets soared as Joe Biden won the election.
 NBC is rather closer to the truth when it notes that Pfizer's vaccine news has something to do with the stock market surge.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 5.9% at opening, hitting record highs, and may even go past 30,000 for the first time.
 White Studies 101: Biden and higher ed urged to give white working class attention    Paul Bedard   Monday November 09, 2020        They are one of the most sought-after classes of voters, their ills and economic plight highlighted by Democrats and Republicans, but once elections are over, they are typically kicked to the side.
 Biden must avoid another Russian reset    Janusz Bugajski   Monday November 09, 2020        Since the Cold War victory, every incoming administration believed it possessed the magic formula to turn Russia into a strategic partner.
 Every time, the administration has been misled by the Kremlin and ended up trying to contain a new act of aggression.
 Keep watch on a growing, threatening China before it's too late    Martin Horiƒçka   Monday November 09, 2020        In September 1960, Sen. John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon met in a Chicago studio for the first televised presidential debate.
 Although they were there to discuss domestic matters, Kennedy argued from the start that the United States was slowly losing its economic lead over the Soviet Union.
 Biden's historic chance to unite the country    Washington Examiner   Monday November 09, 2020        Joe Biden is almost certain to be sworn into office in January as the nation‚Äôs 46th president.
 He has built vote leads in battleground states, and these appear to be insuperable despite President Trump‚Äôs declared intention to mount legal challenges to them.
 Trump accuses Democrats of cheating?
 What goes around comes around.
 Byron York   Sunday November 08, 2020        Many Democrats and their allies in the media are angry that President Trump has accused Joe Biden and Democrats of cheating to win the presidency.
 No doubt some are frustrated, even in victory.
 But why should they be surprised when Trump says the other side cheated?
 After all, they said the same thing four years ago after the 2016 election.
 If Joe Biden wins this election, Republicans must move forward ‚Äî with or without Trump    Kaylee McGhee White   Sunday November 08, 2020        The election is not over yet.
 President Trump has not conceded, and his campaign plans to pursue its case in court in at least four states.
 But unless Trump is sitting on a pile of evidence that confirms tens of thousands of ballots across the country were illegitimate, it looks like Democratic candidate Joe Biden will be our next president.
 Joe Biden‚Äôs pledge of unity will be tested quickly    Kaylee McGhee White   Sunday November 08, 2020        Joe Biden‚Äôs first remarks as the apparent winner of the presidential election were a call for unity and healing.
 It was a good speech ‚Äî full of hope and charity, and I actually believe he meant it.
 But his call for compromise will be tested early on if, when the dust settles, he is certified as our next president.
 NFL Week 9: Three games you can't miss    Noah Niederhoffer   Sunday November 08, 2020        There may be more important things going on in the news, but the NFL rolls on into Week 9!
 If you're annoyed at the counting delays in the presidential election, sit back and watch some football since you know every game will be decided in no more than a few hours.
 Below are three games you can't miss this week.
 Voters stood up to the culture and declared their center-right values    Salena Zito   Sunday November 08, 2020        PINE TOWNSHIP ‚Äî Had you spent any space of time in this northern suburb of Pittsburgh listening to voters, finding out what things mattered to them when it came to schools, community growth, economic prosperity, and the emotional impact of COVID-19 lockdowns, you would have at least been skeptical of the media narrative and the polls that claimed suburban voters here are no longer center-right.
 Biden's immigration policies are bad for the country and threaten the conservative movement    Tom Joyce   Saturday November 07, 2020        Now that multiple outlets have declared Joe Biden the winner of the presidential election, it's apparent that Biden will take more than four decades of experience back to Washington, D.C. ‚Äî including a horrible immigration policy.
 If the Republican Party maintains control of the Senate, which appears likely, they must do everything in their power to stop him from enacting it, or they risk killing the conservative movement.

 Joe Biden's victory is much less worrisome than it could have been    Washington Examiner   Saturday November 07, 2020        Many news organizations have now called the presidential election for Joe Biden, who has extended his leads in battleground states.
 This is a disappointment to many conservatives who had either loved President Trump or at least come to make their peace with him given his conservative policies.
 Donald Trump lost the presidency because he refused to act like a president    Philip Klein   Saturday November 07, 2020        Four years ago, when President Trump pulled off one of the biggest upsets in U.S. political history, one possible explanation was that Hillary Clinton was such a uniquely bad candidate that Trump managed to win in spite of his outrageous behavior that turned off many voters.
