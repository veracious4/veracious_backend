   Eliminate insurance exchanges through which certain individuals 
and families will receive federal subsidies to substantially reduce the cost of purchasing health insurance coverage; 
  Significantly reduce eligibility for Medicaid for residents of states that will choose to expand their programs under the ACA; 
  Increase the rate of growth of Medicare™s payment rates for most services (relative to the growth rates projected under current law);   Eliminate the excise tax on health insurance plans with relatively high premiums; 
  Eliminate certain taxes on individuals and families with relatively high incomes; and 
  Make various other changes to the federal tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs. 
 Table 1 summarizes CBO and JCT™s asse
ssment of the changes in federal 
budget deficits that would result from the effects of H.R. 6079 on direct spending and revenues. Table 2 (on 
pages 5 and 6) shows more detail on 
the federal budgetary cash flows for direct spending and revenues 
associated with the legislation. Tables 3 and 4 (on pages 11 and 12) provide 
estimates of H.R. 6079™s effects rela
ted to health insurance coverage: 
Table 3 shows changes in the number of nonelderly people in the United 
States who will have health insurance, and Table 4 shows the primary 
budgetary effects of the legislation™s major provisions related to insurance coverage. 
 Impact on the Federal Budget in the First Decade Assuming that H.R. 6079 is enacted near
 the beginning of fiscal year 2013, 
CBO and JCT estimate that, on balance, the direct spending and revenue 
effects of enacting that legislation wo
uld cause a net increase in federal 
budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013Œ2022 period (see Table 1). That net increase in deficits from enacting H.R. 6079 has three major components: 
 
The ACA contains a set of provis
ions designed to expand health 
insurance coverage, which, on ne
t, are projected to cost the government money. The costs of 
those coverage expansionsŠwhich 
include the cost of the subsidie
s to be provid
ed through the  Honorable John Boehner Page 3 
  exchanges, increased outlays for Me
dicaid and the Children™s Health 
Insurance Program (CHIP), and tax credits for certain small employersŠwill be partially offs
et by penalty payments from employers and uninsured individuals
, revenues from the excise tax on high-premium insurance plan
s, and net savings from other 
coverage-related effects. By repealing those coverage provisions of 
the ACA, over the 2013Œ2022 period, H.R. 6079 would yield gross 
savings of an estimated $1,677
 billion and net savings (after 
accounting for the offsets just mentioned) of $1,171 billion.3  TheACA also includes a number of other provisions related to 
health care that are estimated to reduce net federal outlays (primarily 
for Medicare). By repealing those provisions, H.R. 6079 would 
increase other direct spending in the next decade by an estimated $711 billion.  The ACA includes a number of pr
ovisions that are estimated to increase federal revenues (apart from the effect of provisions related to insurance coverage), mostly by increasing the Hospital Insurance (HI) payroll tax and extending it to 
net investment income for high- 
income taxpayers, and imposing fees or excise taxes on certain 

manufacturers and insurers. Rep
ealing those provisions would reduce revenues by an estimated $569 billion over the 2013Œ2022 period.  
Deficits would be increased under H.R. 6079 because the net savings from 
eliminating the insurance coverage provisions would be more than offset by 
the combination of other spending 
increases and revenue reductions. In 
total, CBO and JCT estimate that H.R. 6079 would reduce
 direct spending 
by $890 billion and reduce revenues by $1 trillion over the 2013Œ2022 period, thus adding $109 
billion to federal budget deficits over that period (see Table 2). For various reasons disc
ussed elsewhere in this document, the estimated budgetary effects of repealing the ACA by enacting 
H.R. 6079 are not equivalent to an estimate of the budgetary effects of the 
ACA with the signs reversed.                                               
3. The estimated net effects of rep
ealing the coverage provisions of the ACA differ slightly from 
CBO and JCT™s current projections of the budgetary effects of those provisions (see 
Congressional Budget Office, 
Estimates for the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the 
Affordable Care Act Updated for the Recent Supreme Court Decision
, July 2012). Some of 
the effects of changes made under the ACA that are captured in those projections would be 
expected to continue even if H.R. 6079 was en
acted. For example, if H.R. 6079 was enacted, 
CBO does not expect health insurers to univer
sally or immediately discontinue the coverage 
of preventive health benefits without copayments that is required by the ACA.

 a. Reductions to risk-adjustment payments 
lag revenues shown later in the table by one
 quarter. The reduction in payments for r
einsurance totals $20 billion over the 10-year period. 
 b. On October 14, 2011, the Secretary of th
e Department of Health and Human Services
 announced that she did not ﬁsee a viable p
ath forward 
for CLASS implementation at this time.ﬂ CBO considers that announc
ement to be definitive new information and as a result, CBO a
ssumes 
that CLASS will not be implemented unless there are changes in 
law or other actions by the Administration that would supersede 
the Secretary™s announcement. Legislation to re
peal the provisions of law establishing the CLASS program are therefore estimated to
 have no 
budgetary effect relative to current law. 
 c. The 10-year total includes $30 billion in 
reduced outlays from non-cove
rage provisions that are not related to Medicare, Med
icaid, or CHIP. 
This amount is partially offset by $16 billion in net increased 
outlays, which represents the outlay portion of several coverag
e-related 
provisions including small employer tax credits, penalty payments 
by employers, and associated effects of coverage provisions on
 tax revenues and outlays for Social Security benefits. 
  
d. Amounts include repeal of fees on manufacturers and importers 
of branded drugs and on health insurance providers, and repeal
 of an excise 
tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. 
 
e. Positive numbers indicate increases in the deficit, 
and negative numbers indicate reductions in the deficit. 
   Honorable John Boehner Page 7  In addition to those effects on direct spending and revenues, by CBO™s 
estimates, repeal of the ACA would reduce the need for appropriations to 
the Internal Revenue Service by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. Repealing the ACA would also reduce the need for appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years, CBO estimates. Such savings might be reflected in reductions in total discretionary spending, or they might free up room for additional spending for other purposes under the caps on discretionary appropriations that were established 
by the Budget Control Act of 2011.  
Projections of the budgetary impact of H.R. 6079 are quite uncertain 
because they are based, in large part, on projections of the effects of the ACA, which are themselves highly 
uncertain. Assessing the effects of making broad changes in the nation™s 
health care and health insurance 
systems requires estimates of a broad 
array of technical, behavioral, and 
economic factors. Separating the incremental effects of the provisions in the ACA that affect spending for ongoing programs and revenue streams 
becomes more uncertain as the time since enactment grows. The recent 
Supreme Court decision that essen
tially made the expansion of the 
Medicaid program a state option has also increased the uncertainty of the estimates. However, CBO an
d JCT, in consultation with outside experts, 
have devoted a great deal of care and e
ffort to the analysis of health care legislation in the past few years, and the agencies have strived to develop 
estimates that are in the middle of the distribution of possible outcomes. 
 Implementing Repeal of 
the Affordable Care Act If H.R. 6079 was enacted near the start of fiscal year 2013, a number of 
final rules and other administrative 
actions to implement the ACA (and some modifications to it that were subsequently enacted) will have taken effect or been finalized during the 2½
 years since that law was enacted. H.R. 6079 does not specify how to implement the requirement that the provisions of law modified by the AC
A be restored as if the ACA had never been enactedŠfor example, with regard to Medicare™s payment rules and certain changes to the Internal Revenue Code that are already in operation. Because of that ambiguity, H.R. 6079 would cede considerable discretion to the executive branch to implement its provisions. 
 
CBO and JCT cannot anticipate with certainty the choices that the executive branch agencies would makeŠparticularly as
 they pertain to the retroactive changes in law. CBO and JCT expect that retroactive adjustments to spending programs a
nd tax provisions would tend to be 
applied in ways that 
would, on net, cost th
e government money:  
  Honorable John Boehner Page 8   For provisions related to the Medicare program, for example, CBO 
assumes that the Department of Health and Human Services would 
implement retroactive changes in payment rules that would increase 
spending (because there would be pressure from, or legal actions by, providers and other potential recipients), and would probably not be able to fully implement changes that would require recoupment of 
payments already made. CBO project
s that the retroactive payments 
would be disbursed over
 the 2013Œ2015 period. 
  Similarly, for some provisions th
at provided new tax benefits or 
increased existing tax benefits and have already been in effect, JCT and CBO expect that the Internal Revenue Service would not be able 
to recover the forgone revenues retroactively. For other provisions 
that are already in effect that created new or increased taxpayer 
liabilities, JCT and CBO expect that taxpayers would be able to file for a refund.   In addition, some provisions cannot be
 retroactively adjusted. For example, 
payment rates and subsidized benefits in the Medicare Advantage program 
and the Part D prescription drug progr
am since the ACA was enacted were established in negotiated contracts. The benefits pr
ovided under those 
contracts cannot be adjusted retroactively. Therefore, CBO assumes that the payments made under those contracts w
ould not be adjusted if H.R. 6079 
was enacted.   CBO and JCT also anticipate that some
 of the changes induced by the ACA 
in how public and private health insurance and health care programs are 
administered would be sustained under 
H.R. 6079. In some cases, the ACA established deadlines that accelerated certain activities, such as expansion of the competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment in Medicare. CBO expects that expansion of that program would not revert to the slower schedule anticipated under prior law. Likewise, entities that pay for or provide health care have change
d processes to comply with standards 
established pursuant to the administra
tive simplification provisions of the ACA, and long-term care facilities have changed prescribing processes to comply with a provision of the ACA that required those facilities to reduce certain wasteful practices. CBO expects that those already-implemented changes in processes will have a lasting impact even if the ACA is repealed.    Honorable John Boehner Page 9  Effects on Insurance Coverage and Their Budgetary Impact H.R. 6079 would repeal all of the prov
isions of the ACA that are designed 
to expand insurance coverage as well 
as related provisions. Most of those 
provisions are scheduled to go in
to effect in January 2014. Under H.R. 6079, about 30 million fewer nonelderly people would have health insurance in 2022 than under curren
t law, leaving a total of about 60 million nonelderly people uninsured (see Table 3). About 81 percent of legal nonelderly residents would have insurance coverage in 2022, compared with 92 percent projected under cu
rrent law (and 82 percent currently). 
 That difference of 30 million in the number of uninsure
d people in 2022 reflects a number of changes relative to what will occur under current law. If H.R. 6079 was enacted, approximately 25 million people who will otherwise purchase their own coverage
 through insurance exchanges would 
not do so, and Medicaid and CHIP wo
uld have roughly 11 million fewer enrollees. Partly offsetting those reductions would be net 
increases, relative to the number projected under current law, of about 3 million people purchasing individual coverage directly from insu
rers and about 4 million people obtaining coverage through their employer. 
 
CBO and JCT estimate that the repeal of the provisions of the ACA 
affecting health insurance coverage would result in a 
net decrease in federal deficits of $1,171 billion ov
er fiscal years 2013 through 2022 (see Table 4).  That figure includes a $643 billion reduction in net federal outlays for Medicaid and CHIP and $1,013 billion in savings resulting from eliminating the exchange subsidies (and related spending). In addition, the repeal of the tax credit for certain small employers who offer health 
insurance is estimated to save $22 billion over 10 years.   Those gross
 savings of $1,677 billion through 2022 would be partly offset by lower revenues or higher costs, totaling $506 billion over the 10-year budget window, from four sources related to insurance coverage:  
  Eliminating the penalty payments by uninsured individuals, which 
would reduce revenues by $55 billion 
over 10 years;    Eliminating penalty payments by employers whose workers would 
receive subsidies via the exchanges, which would increase deficits by $117 billion over 10 years; 
  
  Honorable John Boehner Page 10    Eliminating the excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, 
resulting in a decline in revenues of $111 billion over 10 years; and   Other budgetary effects, mostly on tax revenues, associated with 
shifts in the mix of taxable and nontaxable compensation resulting 
from changes in employment-based health insurance coverage, 

which would increase deficits by $223 billion over 10 years.4  In addition to the federal budgetary
 effects, repealing the coverage 
provisions of the ACA would reduce 
states™ spending for Medicaid and CHIP. Those provisions of the ACA will increase states™ spending because states are required to pay a share of outlays for Medicaid and CHIP; 

consequently, under H.R. 6079, stat
es™ spending on Medicaid and CHIP 
would be less than under current law.5 CBO estimates that enacting  
H.R. 6079 would reduce state gover
nments™ spending for Medicaid and 
CHIP for provisions related to coverage by $41 billion over the 2013Œ2022 period.                                               
4. Changes in the extent of employ
ment-based health insurance affect federal revenues because 
most payments for that coverage are tax-pref
erred. If employers increase or decrease the 
amount of compensation they provide in the form of health insurance (relative to current-law 

projections), CBO and JCT assume that offsetting changes will occur in wages and other 
forms of compensationŠwhich are generally taxableŠto hold total compensation roughly the 
same. Such effects also arise with respect to sp
ecific elements of the proposal (such as the tax 
credits for small employers), and those effect
s are included in the estimates for those 
elements. 
5. Costs for Medicaid and CHIP are shared by the federal government and the states. The 
average federal share of spending typically has been 57 percent for Medicaid and 70 percent 
for CHIP. Under the ACA, the federal government will pay all of the costs for people made 

newly eligible for the Medicaid program through 2016, between 90 percent and 95 percent of 
their costs for 2017 through 2019, and 90 percent in 2020 and thereafter. Similarly, for CHIP 
the ACA increased the federal share of all costs 
for 2016 through 2019 from an average of 70 
percent to an average of about 93 percent. Under H.R. 6079, the federal share of spending 
would remain, on average, 57 percent for Medicaid and 70 percent for CHIP.

tary changes to Medicaid and CHIP. CBO estimates that H.R. 6
079 would reduce state spending 
on Medicaid and CHIP in the 2013-2022 period by about $41 billi
on as a result of repealing the coverage provisions. 
 d. Includes spending for high-risk pools, premium review activities,
 loans to co-op plans, grants 
to states for the establishme
nt of exchanges, and the net budgetary 
effects of proposed collections and payments fo
r risk adjustment and tr
ansitional reinsurance. 
 e. The effects on the deficit of H.R.6079 include the associated
 effects on tax revenues of changes in taxable compensation. 
 
f. The effects are almost entirely on tax revenues. CBO estimates 
that outlays for Social Security benefits would decrease by a
bout $7 billion over the 2013-2022 
period. 
   Honorable John Boehner Page 13  Effects on Health Insurance Premiums 
CBO has not analyzed the effect of H.R. 6079 on health insurance premiums; however, it expects that the effects on premiums of repealing the 
ACA would be similar to reversing 
the effects estimated in November 2009.6  In particular, that analysis suggests that if H.R. 6079 was enacted, premiums for health insurance in the individual market would be somewhat 
lower than under current law, mostly because the average insurance policy in that market would cover a smaller share of enrollees™ costs for health care and a slightly narrower range of benefits. Nevertheless, many people 
would end up paying more for health
 insuranceŠbecause under current 
law, the majority of enrollees purchasing coverage in that market would 
receive subsidies via the insurance exchanges, and H.R. 6079 would eliminate those subsidies. 
 
That prior analysis of premiums also suggests th
at premiums for employment-based coverage obtained 
through large employers would be 
slightly higher under H.R. 6079 than 
under current law, reflecting the net impact of many relatively small changes. Premiums for employment-based 
coverage obtained through
 small employers might be slightly higher or 
slightly lower (owing to uncertainty about the impact of the enacted legislation on premiums in that market). 

 Effects on Spending for Medicare, Medicaid, and Other Programs 
Many of the other provisions that woul
d be repealed by enacting H.R. 6079 
affect spending for Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs. The 
ACA made numerous changes to payment rates and payment rules in those 
programs, established a voluntary fe
deral program for long-term care 
insurance through the Community Living
 Assistance Services and Supports 
(CLASS) provisions, and made certain other changes to federal health 

programs. In total, CBO estimates that repealing those provisions would 

increase net federal spending by $711 billion over the 2013Œ2022 period. (Those budgetary effects are summarized in Table 1.)  
Spending for Medicare would increase by an estimated $716 billion over that 2013Œ2022 period. Federal spending for Medicaid and CHIP would 
increase by about $25 billion from repealing the noncoverage provisions of the ACA, and direct spending for othe
r programs would decrease by about 
$30 billion, CBO estimates.                                                
6. See Congressional Budget Office, 
letter to the Honorable Evan Bayh providing an analysis of 
health insurance premiums under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
 (November 
30, 2009). 
 Honorable John Boehner Page 14  Within Medicare, net increases in spending for the services covered by Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance) would total $517 billion and $247 billion, respectively. Those increases would be partially offset by a $48 billion reduction in net spending for Part D.  The provisions whose repeal would resu
lt in the largest increases in federal deficits include the following (all estimates are for the 2013Œ2022 period): 
  Repeal of the reductions in the annual updates to Medicare™s 
payment rates for most services in 
the fee-for-service sector (other than physicians™ services) would increase Medicare outlays by $415 billion. (That figure excludes interactions between those 
provisions and othersŠnamely, th
e effects of those changes on 
payments to Medicare Advantage pl
ans and collections of Part B premiums.) Of that amount, highe
r payments for hospital services account for $260 billion; for skilled nursing services, $39 billion; for hospice services, $17 billion; for hom
e health services, $66 billion; and for all other services, $33 billion. 
  Repeal of the new mechanism 
for setting payment rates in the Medicare Advantage program would increase Medicare outlays by 

$156 billion (before considering interactions with other provisions).    Repeal of the reductions in Medi
caid and Medicare payments to 
hospitals that serve a large number of low-income patients, known as 
disproportionate share hospitals (DSH), would increase federal 
spending by $56 billion.  
 Repeal of other provisions pert
aining to Medicare, Medicaid, and 
CHIP (other than the coverage-related provisions discussed earlier) 
would increase federal spending by $114 billion.
7 That figure includes a $3 billion increase in spending from eliminating the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB).
8 Under current law, the IPAB will be required, under certain circumstances, to recommend changes to the Medicare program to reduce that 

program™s spending; such changes will go into effect automatically. 
                                               
7. That figure incorporates the effect on federal spending for prescription drugs and biologics of 
Public Law 112-144, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which 
was enacted earlier this year
. 8. See Congressional Budget Office, 
cost estimate for H.R. 452, the Medicare Decisions 
Accountability Act of 2011
 (March 6, 2012). 
 Honorable John Boehner Page 15  Repeal of the Community Living 
Assistance Services and Supports 
(CLASS) provisions would have no impact on projected federal deficits. 

The ACA established the CLASS program as a national, voluntary long-
term care insurance program for providing community living assistance 
services and supports financed through insurance premiums. On October 14, 2011, the Secretary of Health and Human Services announced that she did not ﬁsee a viable path forward for CLASS implementation at 
this time.ﬂ9 Therefore, CBO™s baseline incorporates no spending or 
premium collections for the CLASS program. Consequently, legislation to 
repeal the CLASS program is estimated to have no budgetary effect relative to current law.10  Effects on Discretionary Spending The figures discussed elsewhere in this estimate generally do not include any savings associated with lower di
scretionary spending under H.R. 6079. 
CBO™s original cost estimate for the ACA, issued in Ma
rch 2010, focused on direct spending and reve
nues because those effects are relevant for pay-
as-you-go purposes and occur without 
any additional legislative action (in contrast with discretionary spending, which is subject to future appropriation action). However, that ea
rlier estimate noted that additional funding would be necessary for agen
cies to carry out the responsibilities 
required of them by the le
gislation and that the legislation also included 
explicit authorizations for a variety of grants and other programs.
11  
Although enacting H.R. 6079 would reduce the amounts of future appropriations that might be needed 
or are specifically authorized, its impact on total discretionary appropr
iations over the next several years 
would depend on future legislative ac
tions. Moreover, the potential impact of H.R. 6079 or any other 
legislation on future appr
opriations is affected by the caps on annual appropriations that were established by the Budget 
Control Act of 2011 through fiscal year 2021. Eliminating the need to implement the ACA might lead to reductions in total discretionary spending

Information About the Potential Discretionary Costs of Implementing PPACA

 Honorable John Boehner Page 16  or might free up some room under those caps for additional spending for other discretionary programs. 

 
By CBO™s estimates, repeal of the health care legislation would reduce the 
need for appropriations to the Internal Revenue Service by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. In addition, repealing the ACA would reduce the need for appropriations
 to the Department of Health and 
Human Services by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years, CBO estimates. 
 
H.R. 6079 would also repeal a number 
of authorizations for appropriations, 
which, if left in place, might or might not result in additional appropriations. In 2011, CBO estimated 
that such provisions authorizing 
specific amounts or extending existing aut
horizations with a specified level, if fully funded, would result in appropriations of around $100 billion over the 2012Œ2021 period.12 Enacting H.R. 6079 would have the effect of 
reversing some but not all of those au
thorizations. For example, H.R. 6079 
would have no impact on pr
ovisions of the ACA that authorized spending 
only for 2012 because appropriations for that year have already been made.  
Enacting H.R. 6079 would probably not
 significantly affect appropriations for spending for programs and activities that existed prior to the ACA. Many of the authorizations in the ACA were for activities that were already being carried out under prior law or th
at were previously authorized and that the ACA authorized for future years. For example, the ACA reauthorized the Indian Health Service (IHS); CBO estimated in March 2012 that the ongoing activities of the IHS would cost $53 billion from 2012 through 2022. Conseque
ntly, just as the authorizations in the ACA of an estimated $100 billion over the 2012Œ2021 period will not necessarily lead to an increase of that amount in 
total discretionary spending, the repeal 
of those authorizations would not necessarily result in discretionary savings 
of that amount. 
 Effects on Revenues Not Related to Coverage A number of changes to the Internal Revenue Code not directly related to the coverage provisions were enacted as part of the ACA. In addition, some of the changes made by provisions affect
ing spending that were not related to the coverage provisions generate
d indirect effects on revenues. For example, one of the ACA™s tax provisions, a requirement for additional information reporting by small businesses of sales to corporations, has

 See Congressional Budget Office, 
cost estimate for H.R. 2, the Repealing the Job-Killing 
Health Care Law Act
 (February 18, 2011). 
 Honorable John Boehner Page 17  already been repealed by the Comprehe
nsive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and 
Repayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpa
yments Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-9). In total, repeal of the remaining provisions not directly related to the coverage provisions is projected to reduce revenues by $569 billion over the 2013Œ2022 period.  
The largest of those revenue effects include the following (all estimates are for the 2013Œ2022 period): 
  The ACA increased the employee™s share of the HI payroll tax rate 
for certain high-income taxpayers a
nd broadened the HI tax base for 
those taxpayers to include net inve
stment income. Repeal of this 
provision is projected to reduce revenues by $318 billion.    Repeal of an annual fee on health in
surance providers is estimated to 
reduce revenues by $102 billion.  
  Repeal of an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of branded 
drugs is projected to reduce revenues by $34 billion.   Repeal of an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain 
medical devices is expected to reduce revenues by $29 billion. 
  Repeal of a $2,500 limitation on the amount individuals may set 
aside on a pre-tax basis in flexible spending arrangements is 
estimated to reduce revenues by $24 billion.  Comparison with Previous Estimate The estimated 10-year increase in deficits from repealing the ACA under 
H.R. 6079 differs from what CBO and JCT estimated for H.R. 2 in February 2011, although the legisla
tive language of the two acts is essentially the same.13 In that prior estimate, CBO and JCT projected that 
changes in direct spending and revenues from enacting H.R. 2 would 
increase deficits by $210 billion over the period from 2012 through 2021 (for 2013 through 2021, the cost was projected to be $185 billion); the current estimate shows th
at changes in direct spending and revenues from 
enacting H.R. 6079 would increase 
deficits by $65 billion from 2013 
through 2021 (and by $109 billion including the effects in 2022).                                                
13.
 See Congressional Budget Office, 
cost estimate for H.R. 2, the Repealing the Job-Killing 
Health Care Law Act
 (February 18, 2011). 
 Honorable John Boehner Page 18  The differences between the two sets 
of estimates result primarily from changes in projections of direct spending and revenues under the ACA 
since CBO prepared the January 2011 baseline. The differences in projections also reflect legislation that has been enacted, changes in CBO™s economic forecast, other updates to the estimates (including the effects of the Supreme Court™s recent decision regarding the ACA), and a shift in the time period covered. The most significa
nt changes in the estimates include the following: 
  CBO and JCT™s July 2012 projections
 of the net costs of the ACA™s 
coverage provisions over the 2013-2
021 period are somewhat lower than those projections were in January 2011. That downward revision reflects the effects of subsequent statutory modifications, 
changes in the economic outlook, updated estimates of the growth in private health insurance premiums, the Supreme Court™s recent decision regarding the ACA, and a 
number of technical changes in 
CBO and JCT™s estimating procedur
es. Altogether, the estimated savings over the 2013Œ2021 period
 from repealing the coverage 
provisions are now $25 billion lower than was the case for H.R. 2.   The Administration™s decision not to implement the CLASS 
program eliminated the budgetary effects of repealing those provisions. Last year, CBO estimated that repealing the CLASS program would increase deficits by about $80 billion over the 2013Œ2021 period. Thus, the Administration™s decision effectively reduces 
the cost of repealing the ACA by $80 billion over that period, 
relative to CBO™s estimate prior to that decision. 
  CBO™s current projections of Me
dicare spending are lower than those in the January 2011 baseline.
14 In aggregate, therefore, the projected increase in spending from repealing the Medicare provisions of the ACA is also smaller. Since January 2011, however, 
CBO has increased the number of 
Medicare beneficiaries who are projected to be enrolled in the Medicare Advantage program (and 

reduced the number of beneficiaries 
estimated to be enrolled in the fee-for-service component of Medicare). The estimates presented 
here reflect that change in the projected distribution of enrollment.

 See Congressional Budget Office, 
Updated Budget Projections: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022
 (March 2012). 
 Honorable John Boehner Page 19    More of the funding provided by
 the ACA has now been obligated 
or spent than was the case when the estimate of H.R. 2 was completed. As a result, larger 
amounts would not be recovered by 
enacting H.R. 6079 compared to the amounts estimated for H.R. 2. 
In addition, more regulations implementing aspects of that 

legislation have been 
promulgated, and more provisions of the ACA 
have been partially or fully implemented. The current estimate of the budgetary impact of repealing the ACA reflects those actions. 
  The time periods covered by the two estimates differ. The February 
2011 estimate for H.R. 2 covered the years from 2012 through 2021, 
the period used for Congressional budget enforcement procedures when that legislation was being c
onsidered (in calendar year 2011); 
the current estimate of the effects of H.R. 6079 covers the period 
from 2013 through 2022. 
 With the effects of those and other ch
anges since February 2011 taken into 
account, repealing the ACA will lead to an increase in budget deficits over the coming decade, though a smaller one than previously projected, according to CBO and JCT™s estimates. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the estimated effects of H.R. 2 and H.R. 6079 on direct spending, revenues, and deficits. From 2013 through 2016 and 
in 2021, the current estimates of 
those effects are very similar. For 2017 through 2020, the current estimates of the effects on revenues of repealing the ACA are quite close to the 

estimates for H.R. 2, and the estimated effects on direct spending show greater savings; thus the estimated in
creases in deficits are smaller.  Repeal of the ACA would reduce dire
ct spending more than previously 
estimated primarily for two reasons: Eliminating the CLASS program would have no effect (rather than resu
lting in a net loss of income in the first decade), and the estimated costs of repealing other noncoverage provisions of the ACA are lower. Those differences are offset in part by the slightly lower estimated savings from repealing the coverage provisions.

 Honorable John Boehner Page 21  Impact on the Federal Budget Beyond the First 10 Years 
Relative to current law, enacting H.R. 6079 would, CBO estimates, 
increase federal budget deficits in the decade following 2022. CBO does not generally provide cost estimates 
beyond the 10-year projection period. 
Over a longer time span, a wide range of changes could occurŠin people™s 
health, in the sources and extent of 
their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical careŠthat are very difficult to predict but that could have a significant effect on federal 
health care spending. Nonetheless, 
certain Congressional rules require some information about the budgetary impact of legislation in subseque
nt decades, and many Members have 
requested analyses of the long-term budgetary impact of proposed broad 
changes in the health care and health insurance systems. 
 
Using methodology deve
loped during consideration of the ACA, CBO (with input from JCT) assessed the budgetary effects of H.R. 6079 in the decade following the 10-year projection period by grouping the elements of that legislation into broad categorie
s and assessing the rate at which the 
budgetary impact of each of those broad categories would increase over 
time.  
On that basis, CBO estimates that the total increase in deficits during the 2023Œ2032 period from enacting H.R. 6079 would lie in a broad range 
around one-half percent of GDP. CBO 
has not extrapolated that estimate further into the future. However, in view of the projected budgetary effects 
between 2023 and 2032, CBO anticipa
tes that enacting H.R. 6079 would probably continue to increase budget defi
cits relative to those under current law in subsequent decades. The imprec
ision of that estimate reflects the greater degree of uncertainty that attends to it, compared with CBO™s 10-year estimates. 
 
Those calculations incorporate an assumption that the provisions of current 
law would otherwise remain unchanged 
throughout the next two decades. 
However, current law includes a number of policies that might be difficult to sustain over a long period of time. For example, the ACA reduced 
payments to many Medicare providers relative to what the government 

would have paid under prior law. On 
the basis of those cuts in payment 
rates and the existing ﬁsustainable growth rateﬂ mechanism that governs 
Medicare™s payments to physicians, CBO projects that Medicare spending 
(per beneficiary, adjusted for overall inflation) will increase significantly more slowly during the next two d
ecades than it has increased during the 
past two decades. If those provisions 
would subsequently 
be modified or 
implemented incompletely even in th
e absence of H.R. 6079, then the budgetary effects of H.R. 6079 could be quite differentŠbut CBO cannot 
forecast future changes in law or assume such changes in its estimates.  Honorable John Boehner Page 22   If you wish further details on this estimate, please contact me or CBO staff. The primary staff contacts are Holly Harvey, Tom Bradley, Jean Hearne, and Jessica Banthin. Many others at 
CBO, along with staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, contributed to
 this analysis, including Sarah
