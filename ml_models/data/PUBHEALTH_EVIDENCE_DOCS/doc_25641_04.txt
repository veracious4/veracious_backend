That means more people are susceptible to infection, and some will suffer severe disease.
 Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died.
 By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.
 We, however, knew it was wrong and we wrote about it on March 17, 2020.
 Here is the video of Dr. Ghebreyesus’s remarks.
 The Gateway Pundit reported, that the coronavirus fatality rate reported by the liberal mainstream media was completely inaccurate and the actual rate more typical to a seasonal flu – the media was lying again.

 ** The fraudulent model predicted 2.2 million American deaths from the coronavirus pandemic ** The authors of the Imperial College Model shared their findings with the White House Coronavirus task force in early March ** Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx then met with President Trump privately and urged him to shut down the US economy and destroy the record Trump economy based on this model But the Imperial College model Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx pushed was garbage and they recommended the destruction of the US economy using this completely flawed model.
 They were charlatans.
 They lied.
 The CDC silently updated their numbers this week to show that only 6% of all coronavirus deaths were completely due to the coronavirus alone.
 The rest of the deaths pinned to the China coronavirus are attributed to individuals who had other serious issues going on.
 Also, most of the deaths are very old Americans with co-morbidities.
 Not only are the number of deaths linked entirely to the China coronavirus minuscule, but the virus appears to be naturally dying out.
 Let’s face it – at this moment in time anyone who is pushing for more lockdowns and other abuses on our personal rights is either evil or terribly misinformed.
