1. INTRODUCTION
 
Medical marijuana laws (hereafter MMLs) remove state
-
level 
penalties for using, 
possessing
 
and 
cultivating medical marijuana.  
Patients are required to obtain approval or 
certification from a doctor, and doctors who recommend marijuana to their patients are
 
immune 
from prosecution.  
MMLs allow patients to designate caregivers 
who 
can obtain
 
marijuana on
 
their behalf.
 
On June 1, 2012 Connecticut became the 17
th state, along 
with the District of Columbia, 
to enact a MML.  
More than a 
dozen 
state legislatures, 
including those of 
Illinois, 
New York, 
and Pennsylvania 
have recently considered medical marijuana bills.  If these bills are eventually 
signed into law,
 
the majority of 
Americans 
will live in states that permit the use of medical 
marijuana.
 
 
Opponents of medical marijuana tend to 
focus 
on the 
social issues
 
surrounding substance 
use.
  
They 
argue that marijuana is addictive, serves as a gateway 
drug,
 
has little 
medicinal va
lue,
 
and 
leads to criminal 
activity
 
(Adams 2008; Blankstein 
2010).  
Proponents
 
argue 
that
 
marijuana 
is both efficacious and safe
,
 
and can be used to treat the side effects of chemotherapy as well as 
the symptoms of AIDS, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, 
glaucoma and
 
other serious illnesses.  
They
 
cite clinical research showing that marijuana relieves chronic pain, nausea, muscle spasms and 
appetite loss (Eddy 2010; Marmor 1998; Watson et al. 2000), and note that neither the link 
between medical
 
marijuana 
and 
the use of 
other substances
, nor
 
t
he link
 
between medical 
marijuana and
 
criminal activity, has been substantiated (Belville 2011; Corry et al. 2009; Hoeffel 
2011; Lamoureux 2011).
 
This study beg
ins by exploring the effect of MMLs 
on the 
market for 
marijuana u
sing 
price data 
collected 
from 
back 
issues
 
of
 
High Times
, 
the 
leading 
cannabis
-
related
 
magazine in 
  
2
 
 
the United States
.  
Our results are consistent with 
anecdotal evidence 
that 
MMLs 
have le
d to a 
substantial 
increa
se in the supply of high
-
grade
 
marijuana
 
(Montgomery 2010)
.  In 
contrast, 
the 
impact 
of MMLs on 
the market for 
low
-
quality marijuana
 
appears to be
 
modest
. 
 
Next, we turn our attention to MMLs and traffic fatalities, the primary relationship of 
interest.
  
T
raffic fatalities
 
are the lead
ing cause of
 
death among Americans 
ages 5 through 34
 
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010).  To
 
our knowledge, there has been no 
previous examination of this relationship.  Data on traffic fatalities at the state level are obtained 
from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)
 
for the years 
1990
-
2010
.
  
Fourteen
 
states 
and the District of Columb
ia 
enacted a MML during this period.
  
FARS includes the time of day 
the traffic fatality occurred, the day of the week it occurred, and whether alcohol was involved.  
Using this information, we contribute to the long
-
standing debate on whether marijuana an
d 
alcohol are substitutes or complements.
 
 
The 
first full 
year after coming into effect, 
the legalization of
 
medical marijuana is 
associated with an 8 
to 11 
percent decrease in traffic fatalities
.
  
However, the effect of MMLs on 
traffic fatalities involvin
g alcohol 
is larger and estimated with more precision
 
than the effect of 
MMLs
 
on traffic fatalities that do 
not involve 
alcohol.
  
In addition
, we find
 
that the estimated
 
effects of MMLs on fatalities at night and on 
weekends (when alcohol consumption 
rises)
 
are 
larger, and are more precise, than the estimated effects of MMLs on fatalities during the day and 
on weekdays.
 
 
Finally, the relationship between MMLs and more direct measures of alcohol 
consumption is examined.  
Using 
individual
-
level 
data from
 
the Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System (BRFSS)
 
for the 
period 1993
-
2010
, we find
 
that MMLs are associated with 
  
3
 
 
decreases in the 
probability of having 
c
onsumed alcohol in the past month
, 
binge
 
drinking
 
and 
the number of drinks consumed
.
  
 
We c
onclude that alcohol is the
 
likely mechanism through which the legalization of 
medical 
marijuana reduces traffic fatalities.
  
However, this conclusion does not necessarily imply 
that driving under the influence of marijuana is safer than 
driving under the 
influence of 
alcohol
.
 
 
Alcohol is often consumed in restaurants and bars, while many states prohibit the use of 
medical marijuana in public.
 
 
If marijuana consumpti
on typically takes place at home or other 
private locations
, 
then legalization could reduce traffic 
fatalities 
simply 
because
 
marijuana users 
are less likely to drive while impaired.
 
 
 
2. BACKGROUND
 
 
2.1. A brief history of medical marijuana 
 
 
Marijuana was introduced in the United States in the 
early
-
1600s by James
town settlers 
who used the plant in hemp productio
n;
 
hemp cultivation remained a prominent industry until 
the mid
-
1800s (Deitch 2003).  
During the census of 1850, the United States recorded over 8,000 
cannabis plantations of at least 2,000 acres 
(
U.
K. Cannabis Campaign 2011).  Throughout this 
period, marijuana was commonly used by physicians and pharmacists to treat a broad spectrum 
of ailments (Pacula et al. 2002).  From 1850 to 1942, marijuana was included in the 
United 
States Pharmacopoeia
, the of
ficial list of recognized medicinal drugs (Bilz 1992).  
 
 
In 1913, California passed the first marijuana prohibition law aimed at recreational use 
(Gieringer 1999); by 1936, the remaining 47 states had follow
ed suit (Eddy 2010).  In 
1937, t
he
 
Marihuana Tax
 
Act effectively discontinued the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes (Bilz 
  
4
 
 
1992), and marijuana was classified as a Schedule I drug in 1970.
1
  
According to the Controlled 


currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United 

 
 
 
In 1996, California passed the Compassionate Use Act, which removed criminal 
penalties for using, possessing
 
and cultivating medical marijuana.  It also
 
provided immunity 
from prosecution to physicians who recommended the use of medical marijuana to their patients.  
Before 1996, a number of states allowed doctors to prescribe marijuana, but this had little 
practical effect because of federal restrictions.
2
  
Since 
1996, 
16
 
other states
 
and the District of 
Columbia have joined California in legalizing th
e use of medical 
marijuana (
Table 1),
 
although 
it is still classified as a Schedule I drug by the Federal government.
3
  
 
 
 
2.2. 
Studies on substance use and driving  
 
 
 
Laboratory studies have shown that cannabis use impairs driving
-
related functions such 
as distance perception, reaction time, and hand
-
eye coordination (Kelly et al. 2004; Sewell et al. 
2009).
  
However, neither simu
lator nor driving
-
course studies provide consistent evidence that 
these impairments to driving
-
related functions lead to an increased risk of collision (Kelly et al. 
2004; Sewell et al. 
2009) 
perhaps because
 
d
rivers under the influence of tetrahydrocannabinol 
                                        
                  
 
1
 
The Marihuana Tax Act imposed a registration tax and required extensive record
-
keeping, increasing the cost of 
prescribing marijuana as compa
red to other drugs (Bilz 1992).
 
 
2
 
Federal regulations prohibit doctors from writing prescriptions for marijuana. 
 
In addition, even if a doctor were to 
illegally prescribe marijuana, it would be against federal law for pharmacies to distribute it.  Doctors in states that 
have legalized medical marijuana avoid violating federal law 
by recommending marijuana to their p
atients rather 
than prescribing its use.  
 
 
3
 
Information
 
on when MMLs were passed was obtained from a recent Congressional Research Services Report by 
Eddy (
2010).
  
Although the New Jersey medical marijuana law came into effect on October 1, 2010, impleme
ntation 
has been delayed (Brittain 2012). Coding New Jersey as a non
-
medical marijuana state in 2010 has no appreciable 
impact on the results presented below.

(THC), the primary psychoactive substance in marijuana, 
engage in compensatory behaviors 
such as reducing
 
their velocity, avoid
ing
 
risky maneuvers, and 
incr
easing
 

distances

 
(Kelly et al. 
2004; Sewell et al. 2009).
  
 
Like 
marijuana, alcohol impairs driving
-
related functions such as reaction time and hand
-
eye coordination (Kelly et al. 2004; Sewell et al. 2009
).  Moreover,
 
simulator and driving
-
course 
studies provide unequivocal evidence tha
t 
alcohol consumption
 
leads to an increased risk of 
collision (Kelly et al. 2004; Sewell et al. 2009).  Even at low doses
, drivers under the influence 
of alcohol tend to underestimate the degree to which they are impaired (MacDonald et al. 2008; 
Marczinski
 

and take more risks (Burian et al. 2002; Ronen et al. 2008; Sewell et al. 2009).  
When used in 


on driving
-
related 
functions (Sewell et al. 2009, p. 186), although 
chronic 
marijuana users
 
may 
be 
less impaired by alcohol than infrequent users (Jones and Stone 1970; Marks and MacAvoy
 
1989; Wright
 
and Terry 2002).
4
 
 
 
2.3. The 
relationship between m
arijuana and alcohol 
 
 
 
Although THC has not been linked to an increased risk of collision
 
in simulator and 
driving
-
course studies, MMLs could impact traffic fatalities 
through 
the consumption of 
alcohol.
  
While a 
number of studies 
have found evidence of complementarity between marijuana and 
alcohol (Pacula 1998; Farrelly et al. 1999; Williams e
t al. 2004
), others l
end support to the 
hypothesis that marijuana and alcohol are substitutes.
  
For instance, Chaloupka and Laixuthai 
                                        
                  
 
4
 
A large body of research in epidemiology
 
attempt
s to assess the effects of substance use based
 
on observed THC 
and alcohol levels in the blood of
 
drivers who have been in 
accidents.  For marijuana, the results have been mixed, 
while the likelihood of an accident occurring clearly increases with BAC levels (Sewell et al. 2009).  
 
 
  
6
 
 
(1997) 
and Saffer and Chaloupka (1999) found that marijuana
 
decriminalization led to decreased 
alcohol consumption
, while DiNardo and Lemieux (2001) found that increases in the minimum 
legal drinking age were positively associated with the use of marijuana
.
 
 
Two 
recent studies used a regression discontinuity approach to examine the effect of the 
minimum legal drinking age on marijuana use, but came to different conclu
sions.  
Crost and 
Guerrero (2012)
 
analyzed 
data from the
 
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (
N
SDUH)
.
  
They
 
found that
 
marijuana use decreased 
sharply 
at 
21 years of age
, evidence consistent with 
substitutability between alcohol and marijuana
.  In contrast, Yörük and Yörük (2011), who drew 
on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), concluded that 
alcohol 
and marijuana
 
were complements.  However, 
the
se
 
authors
 
appear to have inadvertently 
conditioned on having used ma
rijuana 
at least once
 
since the last interview
. 
 
When 
Crost and 
Rees 
(
forthcoming
) applied
 

research design 
to the NLSY97 data 
without conditioning on having used marijuana
 
since the last interview
, 
they found no evidence 
that 
alcohol and marijuana were complements.
 
 
3. MEDICAL MARIJUNA LAWS 
AND 
THE 
MARIJUANA
 
MARKET
 
MMLs 
should
, in theory, increas
e both the supply of 
marijuana 
and 
the 
demand for
 
marijuana
,
 
unambiguously 
leading to an increase in consumption 
(Pacula et al. 2010)
.
 
 
They 
afford 
suppliers some
 
protection against prosecution, and allow patients to buy medical 
marijuana
 
without fear of being arrested or fined
, lowering the full cost of obtaining marijuana
.
5
 
 
                                        
                  
 
5
 
The majority of MMLs allow patients to register based on medical conditions that cannot be objectively confirmed 
(e.g. chronic pain and nausea
).  In fact, chronic
 
pain is the most common medical condition among 
patients seeking 
treatment (Appendix Table 1
).
  
According to recent Arizona registry data, only 7 out of 11,186 applications for 

-
in, quick
-

provide recommendations for a nominal fee.  Cochran (2010)
 
reported on doctors who provide medical marijuana 
recommendations to patients 
via brief web interviews on Skype.
 
 
  
7
 
 
Because it is prohibitively expensive for the government to e
nsure that all 
medicinal 
marijuana 
ends up in the hands of registered patients
 
(especially in states that permit home cultivation),
 
diversion to non
-
patients 
almost certainly occurs
.
6
  
 
 
The NSDUH is the best source of information on marijuana consumption by adults living 
in the United States.  
However
, the NSDUH does not provide individual
-
level data with state 
identifiers to researchers, and did not publish state
-
level estimates of marij
uana use prior to 
1999.
7
  
Because 5 states (including 
California, Oregon and Washington) legalized medical 
marijuana
 
during the period 1996 
-
1999
, 
we turn to back issues of 
High Times 
magazine in order 
to gauge the impact of legalization on the marijuana market.  
Begun
 
in 1975, 
High Times
 
i
s 
published mont
hly and covers topics ranging from marijuana c
ultivation 
to politics
.
  
Each issue
 
also contains a section entitled 

 
Quotations

marijuana prices from across the country.  
In addition to price, a
 
typical entry includes 
information about wher
e the marijuana was purchased
, its 
strain
 
and its quality
. 
 
We collected price infor
mation 
from 
High Times
 
for the period 1990 through 2011.
 
 
Jacobson (2004)
, who collected information on the price 
of marijuana
 
from 
High Times
 
for the 
                                        
                  
 
6
 
Aside from Washington D.C. and New Jersey, all MMLs enacted during the period 1990
-
2010 allowed for home 
cultivation, and 8 out of 15 allow
ed patients or caregivers to cultivate 
collectively (Appendix Table 2).
 
 
A recent
 
investigation concluded that thousands of pounds of medical marijuana grown in Colorado are diverted annually to
 
the recreational market (Wirfs
-
Brock et al. 2010).  See also 
Thurstone et al. (2011) who interviewed 80 adolescents 
(15 through 19 years of age) undergoing outpatient substance abuse treatment in Denver.  Thirty
-
nine of the 80 
reported having obtained marijuana from someone with a medical marijuana license.  Florio 
(2011) described
 
the 
story of 4
 
8th
-
graders in Montana who received marijuana
-
laced cookies from a registered medical marijuana 
patient.
 
 
7
 
Using these estimates, Wall et al. (2011) found that rates of marijuana use among 12
-
 
through 17
-
year
-
olds were
 


legalized medical marijuan
a.  Using NSDUH data for the years 2002 through 2009, Harper et al. (
2012) found that 
legalization was associated with a small 
reduction
 
in the rate of marijuana use among 12
-
 
through 17
-
year
-
olds.  
Using data for the period 1995

2002 from Denver, Los Ange
les, Portland, San Diego and San Jose, Gorman and 
Huber Jr. (2007) found little evidence that marijuana consumption increased among adult arrestees as a result of 
legalization.

Plant variety (i.e., strain), which part of the plan is used, method of stor
age, and cultivation techniques are all 
important determinants of quality/potency (McLaren et al. 2008).  In recent decades there has been a marked trend 
towards indoor cultivation and higher potency in the United States (McLaren et al. 2008).
  
Jacobson (2
004) argued 
that, ideally, prices would be 
deflated by a measure of potency.  Unfortunately, information on potency is not 
available in the 
High Times
 
data.

A total of 8,271 purchases were coded.  Of these, 7,029 were classified as high
-
quality and 1,242 were classified as 
low
-
quality.  Prior to 2004,
 
information on the seller was occasionally included in the Trans High Market Quotations 
section of 
High Times
.  Although dispensaries were never mentioned, they are a relatively recent phenomenon.  The 
number of dispensaries in California expanded rapidly after 2004 (Jacobson 2011), and the number of dispensaries 
in Colorado and Montana expanded rapidly after 200
8 (Smith 2011; Smith 2012).  We compared 
High Times
 
price
 
data from 2011
-
2012 with price data posted on the internet by 84 dispensaries located in 7 states.  In 4 out of the 7 
states (California, Michigan, Nevada and Washington) prices charged by dispensar
ies were statistically 
indistinguishable from the prices provided by 
High Times
 
readers.  In Arizona, Colorado and Oregon, prices charged 
by dispensaries were significantly lower than prices provided by 
High Times
 
readers; however, these differences 
were g
enerally not large in magnitude.  The greatest difference was in Colorado, where dispensaries, on average, 
charged 24.4 percent less per ounce ($72.8) than the prices provided by 
High Times
 
readers.  In Arizona, 
dispensaries, on average, charged 10.3 perce
nt less per ounce ($36.6) than the prices provided by 
High Times
 
readers; in Oregon, dispensaries
, on average, charged 14.9 percent less per ounce ($37.2) than the prices provided by

Standard errors are corrected for clustering at the state level (Bertrand et al. 2004).  Descriptive statistics a
re 
presented in 
Appendix Table 3.  Mean
 
age in state 
s
 
and year 
t
 
was calculated using Census data.  Data on beer taxes 
are from the 
Brewers Almanac
, an annual
 
publication produced by the Beer Institute.  The unemployment and 
income data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analy
sis, respec
tively. 
Data on 
decriminalization laws are from Model (1993) 
and Scott (2010).  During the period under
 
study,
 
the 
decriminalization indicator 
only captures two policy changes:  
Nevada and Massachusetts decriminalized the use of 
marijuana in 200
1 and 2010, respectively. The majority of decriminalization laws were passed prior to 1990.  
Following Jacobson (2004), the estimates presented in Tables 2A and 2B are unweighted. When the regressions are 
weighted by the number of observations used to calc
ulate median price and state
-
specific linear time trends are 
included on the right
-
hand side, estimates of the relationship between legalization and price are smaller and less 
precise.  Nevertheless, they continue to show that legalization is associated wi
th a statistically significant reduction 
in the price of high
-
quality marijuana after 4 years. When the regressions
 
are weighted by the number of 
observations used to calculate median price but state
-
specific linear time trends are not included on the righ
t
-
hand 
side, estimates of relationship between legalization and price are almost identical to those reported in Tables 2A and 
2B.

Appendix Table 1 presents registry information by state.  Montana legalized medical marijuana in November 
2004.  Two yea
rs later, only 287 patients were registered; seven years later, 30,036 patients were registered.  The 
  
10
 
 
specific linear time trends 
produces no 
evidence that legalization was systematically preceded by 
changes in tastes or policies related to the market for high
-
quality marijuana. 
 
Estimates of the relationship between legalization and the price of low
-
quali
ty marijuana 
are presented in Table

4. MEDICAL MARIJUNA LAWS AND TRAFFIC FATALITIES 
 
The estimates discussed 
above suggest that legalization leads to a substantial decrease in 
the price of high
-
quality marijuana and, presumably, a correspondingly
-
large increase in 
consumption.
12
  
In this section, we test whether the impact of legalization extends to traffic 
fatali
ties.
 
 
 
4.1. Data on traffic fatalities
 
 
As noted above, we use
 
data from 
the 
Fatal Accident Report System (FARS) 
for the 
period 1990
-
2010
 
to
 
examine the relationship between MMLs and traffic fatalities.  These data 
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                          
 
number of registered patients in Colorado increased from 5,051 in January 2009 to 128,698 in June 2011.  Patient 
numbers also appear to be growing rapidly
 
in Arizona, which passed the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act on 
November 2, 2010.  Eleven thousand one hundred and thirty
-
three patient applications had been approved as of 
August 29, 2011; 40,463 patient applications had been approved by June 30, 2012.
 
 
 
12
 
If we assume, conservatively, that legalization has a negligible impact on demand, then the change in marijuana 
consumption is equal to the elasticity of demand multiplied by the percent change in price.
  
Only a handful of papers 
have estimated the price 
elasticity of demand for marijuana.  Using data on UCLA undergraduates, Nisbet and Vakil 
(1972) estimated a price elasticity of demand between 
-
1.01 and 
-
1.51; using data from Monitoring the Future on 
high school seniors, Pacula et al. (2001) estimated a 3
0
-
day participation elasticity between 
-
0.002 and 
-
0.69; using 
data from the Harvard College Alcohol Study, Williams et al. (2004) estimated a 30
-
day participation elasticity of    
-
0.24.

are collected by the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, and represent an annual 
census
 
of all fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle accidents in the 
United States.  
I
nformation 
on the circumstances of each crash and the persons and vehicles involved 
is obtained from a 
variety o
f sources
, including
 
police crash reports, driver licensing
 
files, vehicle registration files, 
state highway department data, emergency medical services records, medical examiner reports, 
toxicology reports, and death certificates.  
 
 
Table 
3
 
presents
 
descriptive statistics and definitions for our outcome measures.  
Fatalities Total
st
 
is equal
 
to the number of traffic fatalities 
per 100,000 
population 
of 
state 
s 
in
 
year 
t
.
13
  
The 
variables 
Fatalities
 
(BAC > 0)
st
 
and 
Fatalities
 

st
 
allow us
 
to examine 
the effects of legalization 
by alcohol involvement.  
Fatalities
 
(BAC > 0)
st
 
is equal
 
to the number 
of 
traffic 
fatalities
 
per 100,000 
population
 
resulting from accidents 
in which 
at least one driver
 
had 
a positive 
blood alcohol concentration
.
  
Fatalities
 

st
 
is defined analogously, but 
at least one driver had
 
to have a blood alcohol 
concentration 
greater
 
than or equal to 0.10.  
Fatalities
 
(No Alcohol)
st
 
is equal to the numbe
r of fatalities
 
per 
100,000 population 
in which
 
alcohol invol
vement was not 
reported.
14
  
A
lcohol involvement
 
is likely measured with error 
(Eisenberg 
2003), and 
the 
possibility
 
exists
 
that some states collected information on BAC levels 
more diligently than others
.
15
  
Focusing on
 
nighttime and weekend fatal crashes can provide 
                                        
                  
 
 
13
 
Population data come from the National Cancer Institute and are available at:  
http://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/index.html
.
 
According to Eisenberg (2003), traffic fatalities in FARS are measured
 
with
 
little to no error.  We experimented with scaling traffic fatalities by the population of licensed drivers and by 
the number of miles driven in state 
s 
and year 
t 
rather than by the state population.  These estimates, which are 
similar in terms of magnitu
de and precision to those presented below, are available upon request.
 
 
14
 
The numerator for 
Fatalities (No Alcohol)
st
 
was determined from two sources in the FARS.  First, all drivers 
involved had to have either registered a BAC = 0 or, if BAC information was missing, the police had to report that 
alcohol was not involved.  
 
 
15
 
We also experimented with calculating the alc
ohol
-
related fatality rates based on the imputed BAC levels 
available in the FARS data.  These estimates, which are similar in terms of magnitude and precision to those 
  
1
2
 
 
additional insight into the role o
f alcohol and help address the measurement error issue.
  
As 
noted by Dee (1999), a substantial proportion of fatal crashes on weekends and at night 
involve 
alcohol.
 
 
Accordi
ng
 
to state registry data, 7
5 percen
t of patients in 
Arizona, and 69
 
percent of 
patients in Colorado, are male.  There is also evidence that many medical marijuana patients are 
below the age of 40.  Forty
-
eight percent of registered patients in Montana, and 42 percent of 
registered patients in Arizona, are between the ages
 
of 18 and 40; the average age of regis
tered 
patients in Colorado is 40
.
16
  
To the extent that registered patients below the age of 40 are more 
likely to use medical 
marijuana recreationally, heterogeneous 
eff
ects across the age distribution
 
might be expect
ed
.

compare pre

and post
-
legalization traffic fatality trends by age group.  The 
solid line represents the average traffic fatality rate for the treated states (those that legalized 
medical marijuana).  The dashed line represents the average
 
fatality rate for the control states 
(those that did not legalize medical marijuana).  Year 0 on the horizontal axis represents the year 
in which legalization took place.  Control states were randomly assigned a year of legalization 
between 
1996
 
and 2010.  
 
Among
 
teenagers (ages 15 through 19), 
young adults
 
(ages 20 through 39) and older 
adults (ages 40 and above)
,
 
average 
traffic fatality rates
 
in the treated states closely follow those 
in the control states through year 
-
1.  This finding is imp
ortant because it suggests that 
legalization was not preceded by, for 
instance, 
new 
anti
-
drunk driving
 
policies, 
increased 
spending on law enforcement
,
 
or hig
hway improvements.  
In the years immediately
 
after 
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                          
 
presented below, are available upon request.  See Adams et al. (2012) for a discussion 
of the BAC imputation 
method.

, 
average 
t
raffic fatality rates 
in MML states 
fall faster 
than average traffic fatality 
rates in 
the 
control states.
  
This divergence is most pronounced among 
20 through 39 year olds
.  
Among teenagers and older adults, 
average traffic 
fatality 
rates
 
in MML states converge with 
average tr
affic fatality rates 
in the control states 
4 to 5 years after legalization
.
 
 
4.2. The empirical model
 
 
 
To further 
explore
 
the relationship between legalization and traffic fatalities
,
 
we estimate 
the following
 
baseline equation
:
 
 
(2
)
 
 
ln(
Fatalities Total
st
) =  

0 
+ 

1
MML

+ 
X

,
 
 
 
 
 
where 
s
 
indexes states and 
t 
indexes years.  
T
he coefficient of interest, 

1
, 
represen
ts the 
effect of 
legalizing medical marijuana.
17
  
In alternative specifications we replace 
Fatalities 
Total
st
 
with
 
the remaining 
outcomes 
listed in Table 
3
.
 
The vector 
X
st 
is composed of the controls described in Table
 
4
, and
 
v
s 
and 
w
t
 
are state 
and year fixed effects, respectively.  Previous studies provide evidence that a variety of state
-
level policies can impact traffic fatalities.  For instance, graduated driver licensing regulations 
and stricter seatbelt laws are associated with f
ewer traffic fatalities (Cohen and Einav 2003; Dee 
et al. 2005; 
Freeman 2007; Carpenter and Stehr 2008).  Other studies have examined the effects 
of speed limits (Ledolter and Chan 1996; Farmer et al. 1999; Greenstone 2002; Dee and Sela 
2003), 
administrati
ve license revocation laws (Freeman 2007), 
BAC laws
 
(Dee 2001; Eisenberg 
2003
; Young and Bielinska
-
Kwapisz 2006; Freeman 2007
),
 
Zero Tolerance
 
Laws (Carpenter 
                                        
                  
 
17
 
This specification is based on Dee (2001), who examined the relationshi
p between BAC 0.08 laws and traffic 
fatalities.
 
  
14
 
 
2004; Liang and Huang 2008; Grant 2010)
, and 
cell
phone bans (Kolko 2009)
.  The relationship 
betwe
en
 
beer taxes and traffic fatalities has also received 
attention from economists (Chaloupka 
et al. 1991; Ruhm 1996; Dee 1999; Young and Likens 2000; Young and Bielinska
-
Kwapisz 
2006).
18
  
In addition
 
to these polices, we include
 
mean age
 
in state 
s
 
and year 
t
, the
 
unemploymen
t rate, real per capita income,
 
vehicle miles driven per licensed driver, 
and 
indicator
s
 
for marijuana decriminalization
 
and 
whether 
a drug per se law
 
was in place
.

4.3. The 
relationship between MMLs and traffic fatalities
 
 
Table 
5
 
presents
 
OLS estimates of the relationship between MMLs and traffic fatalities.  
The regressions are weighted by the population 
of 
state 
s
 
in
 
year 
t
, and the standard errors are 
correc
ted for clustering at the state 
level (Bertrand et al. 2004).
  
The base
line estimate
, in column
 
(1)
,
 
suggests that legalization leads to 
a 10.4
 
percent decrease in the fatality rate.
20
 
 
When
 
we 
include state
-
specific linear time trends, the estimate 
of
 

1
 
retains its 
magnitude
 
but
 
is no 
longer 
statistically 
significant
 
at conventional levels (p
-
value = 
0.139
).

Information on graduated driver licensing laws and seatbelt requirements is available from Dee et al. (2005), 
Cohen and Einav (2003), and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (iihs.org).  Information on administrative 
license revocation laws and BAC
 
limits is available from Freeman (2007).  The FARS accident files were used to 
construct the variable 
Speed 70
.  Data on beer taxes are from the 
Brewers Almanac
, an annual publication produced 
by the Beer Institute.  Data on whether texting while driving 
was banned and whether using a handheld cellphone 
while driving was banned are from 
www.handsfreeinfo.com
. 
 
 
19
 
Mean age in state
 
s 
and year 
t
 
was calculated using 
U.S. Census data
.
 
 
Information on vehicle
 
miles 
driven per 
licensed driver is from 
Highway Statistics
, an annual publication produced by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation.  We recognize that legalization of medical marijuana could have a direct impact on miles driven, but 
follow previous research on
 
traffic fatalities by including it as a control variable (Dills 2010; Eisenberg 2003; Young 
and Likens 2000).  The unemployment and income data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of 
Economic 
Analysis, 
respectively.  Data on decriminali
zation laws are from Model (1993) and Scott (2010).  Data on 
drug per se laws,
 
which prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle with drugs (or drug metabolites) in the system,
 
are
 
from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (2010).
 
 
 
20
 
Controlling for ec
onomic conditions and policies (
such as whether a primary seatbelt law was in effect or whether 
a state had a 0.08 
BAC law) has only a small impact on our estimate of 

1
.  In fact, when the covariates listed in 
Table 5 are excluded from t
he regression, the estimated coefficient reported in the first column of Table 5 
changes
 
from 
-
0.110 to 
-
0.118.
 
  
15
 
 
In columns (3)
 
through (5
), we lag the MML indicator
.  
T
he MML lags are jointly 
significant and 
are, without exception, negative.  However, 
there is evidence that the i
mpact of 
legalization
 
eventually
 
wanes.  
The 
first full 
year after coming into effect, legalization is 
associated with an 8 to 11 percent 
reduction in the 
fatality rate.
21
 
 
The estimated
 
coefficients 
increase in absolute magnitude until the fourth full year after legalization, when there is a 10 to 
13 percent reduction in the fatality rate.  
 
After 5 
years
, 
the 
reduction is
 
between 
4 
and
 
10 per
cent 
an
d only significant when the 
state
-
specific linear time trends are omitted
.  
In the final 
column of 
Table 5
, 
we add a series of
 
MML leads to the model.  Consistent with the graphical evidence in 
Figures 1
-
3, t
he
ir
 
estimated coefficients 
are small
 
and jointly 
insignificant.
 
 
In Table 
6

e 
replace

with 
Fatalities (No Alcohol)
st
,
 
Fatalities
 
(BAC >

st
, 
and 
Fatalities
 

st
.
  
The results 
suggest 
that MMLs are related to traffic fatalities 
through 
the consumption of 
alcohol
.  The estimate of 

1
 
is negative when 
fatalities
 
not involving 
alcohol are considered, but it is relatively small and statisticall
y indistinguishable from zero.  
In 
contrast, the legalization of medical marijuana
 
is ass
ociated with a 13.2
 
percent decrease in 
fatal
ities
 
involving alcohol
, 
and a 15.5
 
percent 
decrease in fatal
ities
 
resulting from accidents in 
which at least one driver
 
had a BAC over 0.10
.
  
Lagging the MML indicator produc
es a similar 
                                        
                  
 
21
 
In comparison, Dee (1999) found that increasing the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) to 21 reduced traffic 
fatalities by at least 9 percent 
a
mong 18
-
 
through 20
-
year
-
olds. Kaestner and Yarnoff (2011) analyzed the long
-
term 
effects of MLDA laws.  They found that raising the MLDA to 21 was associated with a 10 percent reduction in 
traffic fatalities among adult males.
 
Carpenter and Stehr (2008) f
ound that mandatory seatbelt laws decreased traffic 
fatalities among 14
-
 
through 18
-
year
-
olds by approximately 8 percent; Dee et al. (2005) found that graduated driver 
licensing laws decreased traffic fatalities among 15
-
 
through 17
-
year
-
olds by nearly 6 p
ercent.  Because all states 
raised their MLDA to 21 prior to 1990, we do not include it as a control. However, our estimates suggest that 
mandatory seatbelt laws decrease traffic fatalities among 15
-
 
through 19
-
year
-
olds by approximately 11 percent, and 
gr
aduated driver licensing laws decrease traffic fatalities among 15
-
 
through 19
-
year
-
olds by approximately 6 
percent.  While the estimated relationship between 0.08 BAC laws and traffic fatalities is generally negative and 
often large, it is never statistic
ally significant at conventional levels.  This is consistent with the results of Young and 
Bielinska
-
Kwapisz (2006) and Freeman (2007) who found little evidence that 0.08 BAC laws reduced traffic 
fatalities. Finally, consistent with the results of Grant (2
010), we find little evidence that Zero Tolerance laws reduce 
traffic fatalities.

pattern of 
results
: 
 
t
he MML lags
 
jointly predict crashes involving alcohol, but are insignificant 
in the 
Fatalities

st
 
equation.
22
 
 
 
Table 
7
 
provides additional evidence 
with regard to 
the role 
of 
alcohol
 
consumption
.  T
he 
first two columns of Table 7
 
show the relationship between MMLs and traffic fatalities occurring 
on weekdays as compared to the weekend, when the consumption of alcohol rises (Haines et al. 
2003).  Legal
ization is associated 
with an 8.0
 
percent decrease
 
in the weekday traffic fatalit
y 
rate; in comparison
, it is associated with 
a 10
.9 
percent decrease in the weekend traffic fatality 
rate.  The former estimate is not significant at conventional levels, while the latter i
s significant 
at the 10 percent
 
level.
23
 
 
 
The remaining 
columns
 
of Table 
7
 
show the relationship between MMLs and traffic 
fatalities occurring during the day as compared to at night, when fatal crashes are more likely to 
involve alcohol (Dee 1999).  Legal
ization is associated with a 
7.3
 
percent decrease in the 
daytime
 
traffic fatality rate; in comparison
, it is associated with an 11.0
 
percent decrease in the 
nighttime traffic fatality rate.  The former estimate is not significant at 
conventional levels, while
 
the l
atter is significant at the 10 percent
 
level.

A

, the estimate of

However, l
egalization is associated
 
with a 16.7
 
percent decrease in the 
                                        
                  
 
22
 
Restricting our attention to crashes in which at least one driver had a BAC greater than 0, legalization is 
associated with a (statistically insignificant) 11.6 percent de
crease in fatalities among drunk drivers (BAC > 0) and 
their passengers.  This estimate is similar in magnitude to the estimate in column (3) of Table 6.  Nonetheless, we 
find evidence of third
-
part
y
 
effects: 
 
legalization is associated with a 23.4 percent
 
reduction in fatalities among sober 
drivers and their passengers, and a 19.9 percent reduction in fatalities among pedestrians, cyclists and individuals in 
other types of non
-
motorized vehicles.
 
23
 
The hypothesis that these estimates are equal can be rejected at the 10 percent level
.
   
 
 
24
 
It should be noted, however, that we cannot formally reject the hypothesis that these estimates are equal.

and

, estimates of

are smaller and statistically insignificant among 40

Table 
9
 
presents estimates of the relationship between MMLs and traffic fatalities by 
gender.  They provide some evidence that MMLs have a greater impact on fatalities among 
males.  Specifically, legali
zat
ion is associated with a 
10.8
 
percent
 
decrease in the male
 
traffic 
fatality rate as 
compared to a 
6.9
 
percent decrease in the female fatality rate.
  
The former 
estimate is significant at the 10 percent level, while the latter is not significant at conventional 
levels.
25
  
This pattern of results is con
sistent with 
registry data 
show
ing that
 
the
 
majority of 
medical marijuana patients are male.

4.4
. Tests of 
Endogeneity
 
 
U
ntil this point
 
in the analysis
, we have addressed the possibility that legalization went 
han
d in hand with other 
behaviors or policies 
related to traffic fatalities by 
employing 
a rich set 
of controls
.  
Table 10
 
presents
 
o
u
r attempts to tackle the endogeneity issue head on.  
 
                                        
                  
 
25
 
The hypothesis that these estimates 
are equal can 
be 
rejected at the 5 p
ercent level
.  Appendix Tables 4A and 4B
 
present estimates of 

1
 
by age and gender.  The estimated effect of legalization on traffic fatalities is largest among 
20
-
 
through 29
-
year
-
old males and 30
-
 
through 39
-
year
-
old females.  There
 
is evidence
 
that legalization leads to 
reduced traffic fatalities among males over the age of 59.
 
 
26
 
Roughly half of the states that have legalized medical marijuana permit collective cultivation, also known as 

aska, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico and Vermont limit 
caregivers to one patient, prohibit collective cultivation by caregivers, or prohibit home cultivation altogether 
(Appendix Table 2).  In these states, possession limits are easier to enforce, a
nd illegal suppliers are easier to 
identify (Selecky 2008).  Estimates available upon request suggest that the relationship between legalization and 
traffic fatalities is strongest when collective cultivation is permitted. Although negative, the estimated 
effect of 
legalization on traffic fatalities is smaller and statistically insignificant among states that prohibit collective 
cultivation.
  
 
  
18
 
 
First, we 
ra
n
 
a se
ries of
 
regressio
ns 
in which placebo 
MML
s were
 
randomly 
assigned 
to 
control states
.
27
 
 
Because 14
 
states 
and the District of Columbia 
legalized medical 
marijuana 
during the period 1990
 
through 2010
, we 
assign
ed
 
1
5
 
placebos 
per trial
.
 
 
T
he estimated 
c
oefficient of the placebo MML wa
s
 
negative and statistically significant at the 
10 percent level 
only 
10
 
times
 
out of 300
 
trials
.  
 
 
 
Next
, 
we 
estimated 
the relationship between MMLs
 
and traffic fatalities in which 
either 
tire
 
or wheel failure 
was 
cited 
as a potential cause of the crash
.  Although 
road 
improvements, 
increased spending on road 
maintenance
, 
and increased
 
commercial vehicle inspections 
could
 
reduce 
tire/wheel failure
,
 
we fou
nd 
litt
le evidence of a relationship between legalization and 
this 
outcome.
  
In fact, the estimated coefficient of 
the 
MML
 
indicator 
was
 
positive
.
 
 
 
W
e 
also
 
examine
d
 
the relationship between MMLs and 
three 
vari
ables that could 
have 
potentially 
influence
d
 
traffic fatalities:
 
per capita police expenditures, per capita highway law 
enforcement expenditures, 
and per capita 
highway 
service and 
maintenance
 
expenditures
.
28
  
Again, the results provide
d
 
little 
evidence of policy endogeneity: 
 
t
he estimated coefficient of the 
MML
 
ind
icator was
 
small and insignificant in all three 
of these 
regressions
.  
 
Finally
, 
we examined whether 
the 
policy 
variable
s
 
included in the vector 
X
st
 
predict the 
passage of MMLs
.  
The re
sults
 
are reported in Table 11.
  
I
n column (2
) of Table 11,
 
we focus on 
alcohol
-
related policies, such as the beer tax and whether
 
a 0.08 BAC limit was in effect.
 
 
In 
column (3) we include marijuana decriminalization and 
drug 
per se la
ws,
 
which prohibit the 
                                        
                  
 
27
 
This approach is similar that of 
Luallen (2006), who 
examined the relationship between teacher strike days and 
ju
venile crime.  Assignment of the placebo MML was based on random numbers drawn from the uniform 
distribution.
  
 
28
 
The data on per capita police expenditures are from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.  The data on per capita 
highway law enforcement expenditures and per capita highway service and maintenance expenditures are from 
Highway Statistics
, an annual publicati
on produced by the U.S. Department of Transportation.  Data on police 
expenditures are not available for the years 2001, 2003, and 2010; data on highway expenditures are not available 
for the District of Columbia.

operation of a motor vehicle with drugs (or drug metabolites)
 
in the system
.  
Neither
 
the alcohol
-
 
nor drug
-
related 
policies predict the legalization of medical m
arijuana.  
However, when the full 
set of policy variables is 
included
,
 
we find evidence of a negative relationship between 
banning 
the use of handheld cell
 
ph
ones while
 
driving and 
the probability of legalizing medical marijuana
 
(column 4)
.  This result 
raises t
he 
possibility that other, more 
difficult
-
to
-
measure, polices 
affecting traffic fatalities 
may be related to legalization
.
   
 
 
5. MEDICAL MARIJUNA LAWS AND 
ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION
 
 
5.1. Evidence from the BRFSS
 
In this section, 
we use 
individual
-
level
 
data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System (BRFSS) to examine the effects of MMLs on direct measures of alcohol consumption.  
Begun in 1984 and a
dministered
 
by state health departments in collaboration with the Centers for 
Disease Control, th

population (18 years of 
age or older). 
 
In 
1993
,
 
the 
BR
FSS 
was expanded to include all 50 states.  
As part of the core questionnaire, 
BRFSS 
respondents are 
asked
:
 
 
1.
 
Have you had any 
beer, wine, wine coolers, cocktails, or liquor during the past          
month?
 
 
2.
 
During the past month, how many days per week or per month did you drink any 
alcoholic beverages, on the average?
 
3.
 
On days when you drink, about how many drinks do you drink on 
average?
 
 
Using the answers to 
these questions, we constructed 
a
 
variety of 
outcome variables
, including
: 
Drank
 
> 0
, 
an indicator for whether the respondent consumed alcohol in the past mont
h; 
30
 
+ 
Drinks
, an indicator for whether the respondent 
had 30
 
or more drinks in the past month
; 
6
0
 
+
 
Drinks
, an indicator f
or whether the respondent had 6
0
 
o
r more drinks in the past month
; 
and
 
  
20
 
 
Number of Drinks
,
 
equal to the number of drinks consumed in the past month conditional on 
drinking.

29
  
 
The estimates 
in 
Table 12
 
offer
 
additional 
support for the hypothesis that 
legalization 
reduces traffic fatalities through
 
its impact on alcohol consumption
.  
T
hey are uniformly negative 
and often statistically significant 
at conventional levels.  Moreover, 
t
he relationship between 
legalization 
and alcohol consumption 
appears to be 
strongest among 
young adults
, the group for 
whom the relationship between legalization and traffic fatalities was 
strongest
.  
 
For instance, a
mong
 
20
-
 
through 29
-
year
-
olds
, 
legali
zation is associated with a 5.3 
percent 
(.031/.589
) reduction
 
in the probability 
of 
having consumed
 
alcohol
 
in the past month,
 
a 
19.6 percent (.011/.056) reduction in the probability of having 
consumed 60+ drinks
, 
and
 
a 
10.6 
percent 
(2.40/22.71
) reduction in the 
number of drinks consumed
 
(
conditional on having had at 
least one 
drink
)
.

During the period
 
1990
-
2010, 
a
lmost one fourth of 
individu
als killed in traffic
 
                                        
                  
 
29
 
The vector 
X
st
 
includes per capita incom
e, the state unemployment rate, the beer t
ax, an indicator for whether a 
Zero T
olerance drunk driving law was in effect, and an indicator for whether a 0.08 BAC law was in effect.  The 
vector 
Z
ist
 
includes indicators for race, ethnicity, educational attain
ment, marital status, employment status, and the 
season in which the BRFSS interview took place.

Descriptive statistics for the drinking outcomes are presented
 
in 
Appendix Table 5.

accidents, and more than one third of individuals killed in traffic accidents involving alcohol, 
were
 
between the ages of 20 and 
29
.
31
  
 
BRFSS 
respondents 
are also asked 
how many times in the 
past month they binge drank, 
defined as having
 
5 or more alcoholic beverages on an occasion
.
32
  
The estimates 
in Table 12
 
suggest that 
the 
legalization of medical marijuana leads to sharp reducti
ons in binge drinking, a 
form of alcohol abuse 
considered 
to have 

 

al. 
2003, 
p. 70). 
 
Among 18
-
 
and 19
-
year
-
olds, legalization is associated with a 9.4 percent 
(.018/.192) reduction in the probability of binge drinking in the past month; among 40
-
 
through 
49
-
year
-
olds, legalization is associated with an 8.8 percent (.013/.147) reduction in this 
probability.  
A
mong 20
-
 
through 29
-
year
-
olds, legalization is associated with 
a 7.4 percent 
(.012/.163) reduction in the probability of binge drinking at least twice in
 
the past month
.
 
 
 
5.2. Evidence from 
alcohol sales
 
Information on alcohol sales 
is collected by the Beer Institute and published annually in
 
the 
Brewers Almanac. 
 
D
ata on per
-
capita beer s
ales (in gallons) are available 
for the
 
period 
1990
-
2010. 
 
Data on 
per
-
capita wine and spirits sales (in gallons) are available for the period 
1994
-
2010.
 
 
We use t
hese data 
to 
estimate the relationship between legalization 
and alcohol 
consumptio
n
 
at the state level
.  
 
                                        
                  
 
31
 
Using data on 19
-
 
through 22
-
year
-
olds and a regression discontinuity design, Carpenter and Dobkin (2009) found 
that reaching the minimum legal drinking age was associated with a 21 percent increase in the number of days on 
which alcohol is consumed and a
 
15 percent increase in traffic fatalities.  The implied elasticity from these estimates 
is 0.71 (i.e., 0.15/0.21).  Restricting our sample to 19
-
 
through 22
-
year
-
olds, we find that the legalization of medical 
marijuana is associated with a 15.0 percent de
crease in drinks consumed (p
-
value = 0.17) and a 12.2 percent 
decrease in traffic fatalities (p
-
value = 0.16), for an implied elasticity of 0.81 (i.e., 0.122/0.150).
  
 
 
32
 
In 2006, the BRFSS began asking female respondents whether they had had 4 or more dri
nks on an occasion.  
Male respondents were asked whether they had had 5 or more drinks on an occasion throughout the period under 
study (1993
-
2010).
 
  
22
 
 
The results, presented in the top panel of Table 13, 
are consistent with the hypothesis that 
marijuana and 
beer 
are substitutes.  
Specifically
, legalization is associated with a
n almost 5 
percent 
i
ncrease in 
the consumption of 
beer, 
the most popular beverage among 18
-
 
through 29
-
year
-
olds (Jones 2008)
.
33
  
Legalization is negatively related 
to wine
 
sales,
 
and
 
positively related 
to
 
spirit
s
 
sales
, but
 
the
se
 
estimates are not statistically si
gnificant.
  
 
E
stimates of the 
relationship 
between
 
beer 
consumption 
and traffic fatalities 
using 
MML
 
as an instrument
 
are
 
present
ed in 
the bottom panel of 
Table 13.
34
 
 
A 
10 percent
 
increase in 
per
-
capita 
beer sales 
is 
asso
c
ia
ted with 
a 
17 
percen
t
 
increase in total fatalities
.
 
 
 
In comparison, using 
alcohol excise taxes 
as instruments, Young and Bielinska
-
Kwapisz (2006) found that a 10 
percent increase in per
-
capita ethanol consumption led to an 11 percent increase in traffic 
fatalities.  
T
he difference in these 
estimates
 
could 
reflect 
who, in effect, 
is 
being treated
.  O
ur 
analysis of the BRFSS data suggests that the relationship between le
galization 
and alcohol 
consumption i
s strongest among young adults
 
(
a group 
prone to heavy drinking and 
responsible 
for a disproportionate
 
share of traffic fatalities
), while 
there is e
vidence 
that light and moderate 
drinkers are more responsive to increases in the price of alcohol than heavy drinkers 
(Manning et 
al. 1995)
.  
A 10 percent increase in per
-
capita beer sales is associated 
with a
 
24
 
percen
t
 
increase 
in 
fatalities
 
involving alcohol
 
and a 32 
percent increase in fatalit
ies resulting from accidents in 
which at least one driver had a BAC greater than or equal to
 
0.10
.
 
  
 
 
 
                                        
                  
 
33
 
These results help explain why t
he California Beer &
 
Beverage Distributors donated $10,000 to Public Safety 
First, a committee organized to oppose a recent California initiative legalizing marijuana (Grim 2010). 
 
 
34
 
This empirical strategy is based on the assumption that legalization is related to traffic f
atalities exclusively 
through beer consumption. Because the first
-
stage F
-
statistic for the null hypothesis that legalization is unrelated to 
beer consumption is less than 10, the standard proposed by Staiger and Stock (1997), the second
-
stage estimates 
sh
ould be interpreted cautiously.
 
  
23
 
 
6. CONCLUSION
 
 
To date, 
17
 
states
 
and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana.  
Others are likely to follow.  A recent Gallup poll found that 70 percent of Americans are in favor 


 
Despite intense public interest, medical
 
marijuana laws
 
have 
received little attention
 
fro
m 
researchers.  In fact, next to nothing is known about their impact on outcomes of interest to 
policymakers, social
 
scientists, advocates
, and opponents.   
 
The current study draws on data from a variety of sources to explore the effects of 
legalizing
 
medical marijuana.  Using information collected from back issues of
 
High Times
, a 
monthly magazine that advocates for the legalization of 
marijuana, we
 
find that MMLs lead to a 
substantial decrease in the price of 
high
-
quality marijuana
.  
Using data from the Fatality Analysis 
Reporting System
 
(FARS) for the period 1990
-
2010
, 
we find 
that tra
ffic fatalities fall by 8
 
to 11 
percent 
the first f
ull 
year after 
legalization
.  Although
 
registry data from Arizona and Montana 
suggest that more than half of medical marijuana patients are over the age of 40, the estimated 
relationship between legalization and traffic fatalities is strongest among young 
adults.  
 
Why does legalizing medical marijuana reduce traffic fatalities?  Alcohol consumption 
appears to play a key role. The legalization of medical ma
rijuana is associated with 
a 7.2
 
percent 
decrease in 
traffic 
fatal
ities in which there was no reported
 
alcohol involvement,
 
but this estimate 
is not statistically significant at conventional levels.  In comparison, the legalization of medical 
marijua
na is associated with a 13.2 percent decrease in fatalities in which at least one driver 
involved had a posi
tive BAC level.  
 
  
24
 
 
The negative relationship between 
the 
legalization of medical marijuana and traffic 
fatalities involving alcoh
ol
 
lends support
 
to 
the hypothesis that marijuana and alcohol are 
substitutes.  In order to explore this hypothesis further, we 
examine the relationship between 
medical marijuana laws and alcohol 
consumption.  We find 
that 
the
 
legalization of medical 
marijuana is associated with 
reduced alcohol consumption
,
 
especially 
among
 
young adults
.
  
 
Evidence 
from simulator and driving c
ourse studies 
provides a potential 
explanation for
 
why 
substituting marijuana for a
lcohol 
could lead
 
to fewer traffic fatalities.  These studies show that 
alcohol consumption leads to
 
an increased risk of collision (Kelly et al. 2004; Sewell et al. 2009).  
Even at low doses, drivers under the influence of alcohol tend to underestimate the degree to 

on 
1993; Sewell et al. 2009), drive at faster speeds, and take more risks (Burian et al. 2002; Ronen 
et al. 2008; Sewell et al. 2009).  In contrast, simulator and driving course studies provide only 
limited evidence that driving under the influence of mari
juana leads to an increased risk of 
collision, perhaps as a result of compensatory driver behavior (Kelly et al. 2004; Sewell et al. 
2009).  
 
However, because other mechanisms cannot be ruled out, the negative relationship 
between medical marijuana 
laws an
d alcohol
-
related traffic fatalities 
does not necessarily 
imply 
that driving under the influence of marijuana is safer than driving under the influence of alcohol.  
For instance, i
t is possible that legalizing medical marijuana reduces 
traffic fatalities t
h
r
ough its 
effect on substance use in public.  Alcohol is often consumed in restaurants and bars, while many 
states prohibit the use of medical marijuana in public.
35
 
 
Even where it is not explicitly 
                                        
                  
 
35
 

is prohibited; in Connecticut, the smoking of marijuana is 


;
 



  
25
 
 
prohibited, anecdotal evidence suggests 
that 
public use o
f medical marijuana can be 
controversial.
36
  
If marijuana consumption typically takes place at home,
 
then designating a 
driver for the trip back 
from a restaurant or bar becomes unnecessary, and legalization could 
reduce traffic fatalities even if driving u
nder the influence of marijuana is every bit as dangerous 
as driving under the influence of alcohol.

crashes 
in which tire or wheel 
failure
 
was cited as a
 
potential 
contributing factor
 
to 
the accident
.  C
ovariates are listed 
in Table 4
, the regression 
is weighted using

level, is in parentheses.  
The remaining columns represent the results from separate regressi
ons in which the 
dependent variable is equal to the natural log 
of the indicated spending measure.  The covariates are the state unemployment rate and 
income per capita.  
Reg
