 Summary of eRumor: Microsoft has released a security advisory that said Internet Explorer has a security issue that can open up computers to remote code execution if users with an affected browser visit a malicious website.
 The Truth: This is Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983, and it is a real warning.
 The software company said that it is “aware of limited, targeted attacks that attempt to exploit a vulnerability in Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11.
 Microsoft is working on a fix, which will be added to the update feeds.
 At present its solution is for Internet Explorer users to step up their browsers security to “enhanced protected mode.” This can be done by downloading a “toolkit,” which supports operating systems Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.
