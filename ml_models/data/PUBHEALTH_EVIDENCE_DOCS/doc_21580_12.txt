-18   Occupation
  Driver/sales workers and truck drivers had the most 
fatalities
 of any broad occupation group at 966. 
Among all detailed occupations, h
eavy and tractor
-trailer truck drivers had the most fatalities 
at 831.   In 2018, logging workers, fishers and related fishing workers, aircraft pilots and flight engineers, and 
roofers
 all had fatality rates more than 
10 times the all
-worker rate
 of 3.5 fatalities per 100,000 
FTE 
workers
. (See chart 4
.) 
 Police and sheriff™s patrol officers had 108 fatalities 
in 2018, up 14 percent from 2017. 
 Fatal injuries to 
taxi drivers and 
chauffeurs declined by 24 percent to 47, 
the lowest total since 
2003 when comparable data for the occupation were first available
.

.  
 Independent workers
  In 2016, the CFOI began identifying fatal injuries to independent workers. Independent workers are involved in 
a work relationship that is finite
 and
 involves a single task, short-
term contract, or freelance work.
  
  In 2018, there were 621 fatal injuries to independent workers, up from 613 in 2017. 
 Independent workers comprised 12 percent of all fatal injuries in 2018.  
 Occupations with the most fatal 
work injuries to independent workers in 2018 were heavy and tractor 
trailer
-truck drivers (96), followed by 
first
-line supervisors of construction trades and extraction workers 
(61), and construction laborers (48).

highest total since 1999. Their fatal injury rate also increased from 3.2 per 100,000 FTE workers 
in 2017 
to 3.6 in 2018. 
 Hispanic or 
Latino
 workers experienced 961 fatalities i
n 2018, a 6 percent increase from 2017. Sixty-
seven percent of fatally
-injured Hispanic or Latino workers were born outside of the United States.  
 Though the number of fatalities declined for workers 
age 
65 years
 and over in 2018, their fatal work-
injury rate is still more than double the 
all
-worker rate.

  4  TECHNICAL NOTES
  Background 
 The Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), part of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (
BLS
) Occupational 
Safety and Health Statistics (OSHS) program, 
is 
a count of all fatal 
work injuries occurring in the U.S. during 
the calendar year.
 The CFOI uses a variety of
 state, federal, and independent data sources to identify, verify, 
and describe fatal work injuries. This 
ensures counts are as complete and accurate as possible. For 
the 2018 

data, 
over 24,800 unique source documents were reviewed as part of the data collection process. 
For technical 

information and definitions for 
the 
CFOI, 
see
 the BLS Handbook of Methods on the BLS website at 

www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/home.htm
. Fatal injury rates are subject to sampling errors as they are calculated 
using employment data from the Current Population Survey, a sample of households, and the BLS Local Are
a Unemployment Statistics
. For more information on 
measurement error
, see 
www.bls.gov/iif/osh_rse.htm
.  The Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII), another component of the OSHS program, presents 

frequency counts and incidence rates by industry, 
detailed case circumstances
, and worker characteristics for 
nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses for cases that result in days away from work. Counts and i
ncidence 
rates by industry, 
case type
, case circumstances and worker characteristics 
for 2018 w
ere
 published in 
November 2019. 
For 
these data, access the BLS web
site: 
www.bls.gov/iif
.  
 Identification and verification of work-
related fatalities
 In 2018, work relationship could not be independently verified by multiple source documents for 12 fatal work 

injuries
. However, the information on the initiating source document for these cases was sufficient to determine 
that the incident was likely to be job
-related. Data for these fatalities are
 included. 
 Federal/State agency coverage
 The C
FOI
 includes data for all fatal work inj
uries, some of which may be outside the scope of other agencies or 
regulatory coverage.
 Comparisons 
between 
CFOI
 counts and those released by other agencies should account 
for 
the different coverage 
requirements and definitions used by each agency. 
For m
ore

on the scope 
of CFOI
, see

1 Fatal injury rates are per 100,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers. Fatal injury rates exclude workers under the age of 16 years, volunteers, and resident military. Complete 
national rates can be found at www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfoi1.htm#rates. Complete state rates can be found at www.bls.gov/iif/oshstate.htm. National and state rates are calculated 
using different methodology and cannot be directly compared. See www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/calculation.htm#comparisons-of-national-and-state-rates for more information on 

how rates are calculated and caveats for comparison. N/A means a rate was not published for this group.
2 Fatal injury rates rely on the census figures from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) and the employment from the Current Population Survey (CPS). CPS is a sample of households 
that is designed to represent the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States. Sampling errors occur in the CPS because observations are made on a sample, not on the entire population. 

The margin of error (MOE) is a measure of dispersion around the estimated fatal injury rate, expressed at the 95% confidence level. For more on confidence intervals, see www.bls.gov/iif/osh_rse.htm. 

While the MOE measures the variance in the employment calculations, small fatal injury counts can vary substantially from year to year. See www.bls.gov/iif/dangerous-jobs.htm for more information.
3 The CFOI has published data on fatal occupational injuries for the United States since 1992. During this time, the classification systems and definitions of many data elements have changed.
 See the CFOI Definitions page (www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfdef.htm) for a more detailed description of each data element.
4 May include volunteers and workers receiving other types of compensation.
5 Includes self-employed workers, owners of unincorporated businesses and farms, paid and unpaid family workers, and may include some owners of incorporated businesses or members 
of partnerships.
6 Persons identified as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race. The race categories shown exclude data for Hispanics and Latinos.
Note: Data for all years are final. Totals for major categories may include subcategories not shown separately. CFOI fatal injury counts exclude illness-related deaths unless 

precipitated by an injury event.

             1 The Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) has published data on fatal occupational injuries for the United States since 1992. During this time, the classification 
systems and definitions of many data elements have changed. See the CFOI Definitions page (www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfdef.htm) for a more detailed description of 
each data element. Event or exposure is based on the BLS Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS) 2.01 implemented for 2011 data forward.

Note: Data for all years are final. Totals for major categories may include subcategories not shown separately. CFOI fatal injury counts exclude illness-related deaths 

unless precipitated by an injury event.

1 Fatal injury rates are per 100,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers. Fatal injury rates exclude workers under the age of 16 years, volunteers, and resident military. Complete national rates 
can be found at www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfoi1.htm#rates. Complete state rates can be found at www.bls.gov/iif/oshstate.htm. National and state rates are calculated using different methodology 
and 
cannot be directly compared. See www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/calculation.htm#comparisons-of-national-and-state-rates for more information on how rates are calculated 
and caveats for comparison. N/A means a rate was not published for this group.
2 Fatal injury rates rely on the census figures from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) and the employment from the Current Population Survey (CPS). CPS is a sample of households
that is designed to represent the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States. Sampling errors occur in the CPS because observations are made on a sample, not on the entire 
population. The margin of error (MOE) is a measure of dispersion around the estimated fatal injury rate, expressed at the 95% confidence level. For more on confidence intervals, see 

www.bls.gov/iif/osh_rse.htm. While the MOE measures the variance in the employment calculations, small fatal injury counts can vary substantially from year to year. See 

www.bls.gov/iif/dangerous-jobs.htm for more information.
3 The CFOI has published data on fatal occupational injuries for the United States since 1992. During this time, the classification systems and definitions of many data elements
have changed.
  See the CFOI Definitions page (www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfdef.htm) for a more detailed description of each data element. Occupation is based
on
 the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) 2010 system. 
4 Includes fatal injuries to persons identified as resident armed forces regardless of individual occupation listed.
Note: Data for all years are final. Totals for major categories may include subcategories not shown separately. CFOI fatal injury counts exclude illness-related deaths 

unless precipitated by an injury event.

1 Fatal injury rates are per 100,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers. Fatal injury rates exclude workers under the age of 16 years, volunteers, and resident military. 
Complete national rates can be found at www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfoi1.htm#rates. Complete state rates can be found at www.bls.gov/iif/oshstate.htm. National and state rates are calculated
using different methodology and cannot be directly compared. See www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/calculation.htm#comparisons-of-national-and-state-rates for more information on how
rates are calculated and caveats for comparison. N/A means a rate was not published for this group.
2 Fatal injury rates rely on the census figures from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) and the employment from the Current Population Survey (CPS). CPS is a sample of households
that is designed to represent the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States. Sampling errors occur in the CPS because observations are made on a sample, not on the entire population. 
The margin of error (MOE) is a measure of dispersion around the estimated fatal injury rate, expressed at the 95% confidence level. For more on confidence intervals, see www.bls.gov/iif/osh_rse.htm.
While the MOE measures the variance in the employment calculations, small fatal injury counts can vary substantially from year to year. See www.bls.gov/iif/dangerous-jobs.htm for more information.
3 The CFOI has published data on fatal occupational injuries for the United States since 1992. During this time, the classification systems and definitions of many data elements have changed.
  See
the CFOI Definitions page (www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfdef.htm) for a more detailed description of each data element. Industry is based on the 2012 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).
4 Includes all fatal occupational injuries meeting this ownership criterion across all specified years, regardless of industry classification system.
5 Includes fatal injuries at all establishments categorized as Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction (Sector 21) in the North American Industry Classification System, including establishments
not governed by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) rules and reporting, such as those in Oil and Gas Extraction.
6 Includes fatal injuries to workers employed by governmental organizations regardless of industry. Includes all fatal occupational injuries meeting this ownership criterion across all specified
years, regardless of industry classification system. 
Note: Data for all years are final. Totals for major categories may include subcategories not shown separately. CFOI fatal injury counts exclude illness-related deaths 
unless precipitated by an injury event.
