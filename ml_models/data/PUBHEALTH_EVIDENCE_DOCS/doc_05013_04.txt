 Biden held leads in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia, putting him in a stronger position to capture the 270 Electoral College votes needed to take the White House.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There was intense focus on Pennsylvania, where Biden led Trump by more than 28,000 votes, and Nevada, where Biden was up by about 22,000.
 \"The numbers tell us a clear and convincing story: We’re going to win this race,” the former vice president said.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Standing alongside running mate Kamala Harris, Biden wasn’t able to give the acceptance speech at that time that his aides had hoped.
 But he hit notes of unity, seemingly aimed at cooling the temperature of a heated, divided nation.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We have to remember the purpose of our politics isn’t total unrelenting, unending warfare,” he said.
 “No, the purpose of our politics, the work of our nation, isn’t to fan the flames of conflict, but to solve problems, to guarantee justice, to give everybody a fair shot.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump took to Twitter and remained out of sight as the results gradually expanded Biden’s lead in must-win Pennsylvania.
 On Saturday, Trump repeated baseless allegations of election fraud and illegal voting, but they were quickly flagged as potentially misleading by the social media platform.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s campaign was mostly quiet.
 It was a dramatic difference from earlier in the week, when officials vocally projected confidence and held news conferences announcing litigation in key states.
 Several other members of the White House staff and Trump’s campaign team also tested positive.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s handling of the pandemic has been the defining issue of the campaign.
 The president, first lady Melania Trump and several other people in Trump’s orbit have fallen ill and recovered.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A few states remained in play in the race: Georgia and North Carolina were still too early to call, along with Pennsylvania and Nevada.
 In all four states the margins between Trump and Biden were too narrow and the number of ballots left to be counted too great for The Associated Press to declare a winner.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The uncertainty left Americans across the nation glued to their TVs and smartphones, checking for updates to a vote count that, for many, appeared to inch along.
 In Pennsylvania, officials were not allowed to begin processing mail-in ballots until Election Day under state law.
 In Nevada, there were a number of provisional ballots cast by voters who registered on Election Day, and officials had to verify their eligibility.
 Recounts could be triggered in both Pennsylvania and Georgia.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;With his path to reelection appearing to greatly narrow, Trump was testing how far he could go in using the trappings of presidential power to undermine confidence in the vote.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump did claim that he won late on Election Night.
 He also tweeted that he had “such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by,” although it was well known that votes cast before Tuesday were still being legally counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Pro-Trump protesters — some openly carrying rifles and handguns — rallied outside vote-tabulation centers in a few cities Friday, responding to Trump’s groundless accusations that the Democrats were trying to “steal” the White House.
 Roughly 100 Trump supporters gathered for a third straight day in front of the elections center in Phoenix, where hundreds of workers were processing and counting ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Maryland GOP Gov.
 Larry Hogan, a potential presidential hopeful who has often criticized Trump, said there was “no defense” for Trump comments “undermining our Democratic process.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Even Trump’s own administration has pushed back at the claims of widespread voter fraud and illegal voting, without mentioning that Trump was the one making the allegations.
 The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which oversees U.S. election security, also noted local election offices have detection measures that “make it highly difficult to commit fraud through counterfeit ballots.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s campaign has engaged in a flurry of legal activity across the battleground states.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Friday evening, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito approved a GOP request ordering county boards to comply with Pennsylvania state guidance to keep the late ballots separate from those received before or on Election Day.
 Alito, however, did not direct election officials to stop counting the ballots, as the Republicans had also sought.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But judges in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania quickly swatted down other legal action.
 A federal judge who was asked to stop vote counts in Philadelphia instead forced the two sides to reach an agreement without an order over the number of observers allowed.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Weissert reported from Wilmington, Delaware.
 Election officials, Democrats and some Republicans blanched at his baseless recitation of sinister doings and his effort to delegitimize democracy's highest calling.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Since the tide turned after election night and Democrat Joe Biden gained strength in the counting, Trump lashed out at results he didn't like, often lapsing into all-capital letters with his hectoring.
 ... We think there is going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence and so much proof.” — remarks Thursday night from the White House.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: Trump produced no evidence of systematic problems in voting or counting.
 In fact, the ballot-counting process across the country has been running smoothly for the most part, even with the U.S. in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;One of his main complaints, that counting spilled over past Election Day, is meritless.
 No presidential election has had all the votes counted the same day and there is no law or even expectation that that should be the case.
 The surge in mailed ballots and the high turnout have made the process slower than usual in some, but not all, cases.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;PENNSYLVANIA\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “In Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election and we think much more than that and they are counting those without any postmarks or any identification whatsoever.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: “Partisan Democrats” didn’t ordain this.
 It was the state Supreme Court that ruled ballots mailed before the end of Election Day could be received up to three days later and still be counted.
 It may review the matter again later.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A number of other states have also made accommodations for the crush of mailed ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “Pennsylvania Democrats have gone to the state Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers.
 ...
 They don’t want anybody in there.
 They don’t want anybody watching them while they are counting the ballots.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt; THE FACTS: That’s false.
 He is wholly misrepresenting a court case in the state.
 No one tried to ban poll watchers representing each side in the election.
 Democrats did not try to stop Republican representatives from being able to observe the process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The main issue in the case was how close observers representing the parties could get to election workers who are processing mail-in ballots in Philadelphia.
 The Trump campaign sued to allow the observers to get closer than the guidelines had allowed.
 A court ruled in favor of that request.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;MICHIGAN\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: That’s false.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Absentee ballots were counted at a downtown convention center, where some 134 counting boards were set up.
 Each party was allowed one poll watcher per board, said City Clerk Janice Winfrey.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She said she was not aware of any Republican poll watchers being removed but noted some had been “very aggressive, trying to intimidate the poll workers and processors.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Mark Brewer, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said he was inside the convention center and access was cut off to some people from both sides at one point because of capacity restrictions related to the pandemic.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;GEORGIA\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: No, the state’s elections are overseen by a Republican, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “The 11th Circuit ruled that in Georgia the votes have to be in by Election Day, that they should be in by Election Day.
 And they weren’t.
 Votes are coming in after Election Day.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: That’s not an accurate description of the ruling in question or what happened in the election in Georgia.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Although the 11th U.S.
 Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that votes must be in by 7 p.m. Election Day for them to count, an exception was made for ballots from the members of U.S. military serving overseas.
 Those could be received until 5 p.m. Friday and still count.
 Election officials in Georgia are still counting votes, but they are votes that have been lawfully received.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;NON-SHENANIGANS\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “If you count the legal votes, I easily win.
 if you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: This is baseless.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Neither Trump’s campaign aides nor election officials identified substantial numbers of “illegal” votes, much less the mammoth numbers it would take to ruin an easy win by Trump in an election where more than 140 million people voted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He frequently speaks as if mail-in voting itself is illegitimate.
 But it unfolded in accordance with state voting rules, in some cases adapted by officials to help voters get through the pandemic safely.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: \"We were winning in all the key locations by a lot, actually.
 And then our number started miraculously getting whittled away in secret.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: He has no foundation to make this accusation.
 The change in fortunes he speaks about is explained by the nature of vote counting in the states, not by any sudden surge of malfeasance that others have not seen.
 And it not happen in “secret” any more than his initial leads developed in secret.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Often, big cities are slower to report their numbers, and those votes tend skew Democratic.
 Likewise, many states tend to count mail-in ballots at the end of the process.
 That portion of the vote has tended to favor Biden, particularly because Trump urged his supporters in advance to avoid mail-in voting and to vote in person either early or on Election Day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump finished election night with leads in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, among the states most in play, then saw his advantage begin to fray Wednesday and past that.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “ANY VOTE THAT CAME IN AFTER ELECTION DAY WILL NOT BE COUNTED!
 — tweet Thursday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: Not true.
 Despite the tweet shout, votes received in the mail after Tuesday were counted in many places, and legally.
 Roughly 20 states allow for late-arriving ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;KELLYANNE CONWAY, unofficial Trump adviser: “Why are we in such a rush to finish this election prematurely?
 Let’s be patient.
 Let’s take a deep breath.
 Let’s count every legal vote.
 I think it’s a time to be methodical and not emotional.” — Thursday on “Fox &amp; Friends.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP, less than an hour later: “STOP THE COUNT!” — tweet.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: The count went on.
 A president doesn't control ballot counting.
 But if state and local officials had somehow stopped counting all at once, that would have frozen a tally that had Biden ahead in electoral and popular votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In reality, Trump wanted counting stopped only in undecided key states where he was ahead and Biden might catch up, not the reverse.
 Voting stopped everywhere on Tuesday, Election Day.
 Voting had even stopped in Hawaii, where the clock is five hours behind Washington, when he appeared in the East Room after 2 a.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He may have meant counting should stop.
 But state and local officials have never counted all the votes in a presidential election in one day, there is no obligation for them to do so and they did not stop in response.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“IF YOU COUNT THE LEGAL VOTES, I EASILY WIN THE ELECTION!
 IF YOU COUNT THE ILLEGAL AND LATE VOTES, THEY CAN STEAL THE ELECTION FROM US!” — statement released Thursday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: He presented no calculation to back this up, or evidence of late votes or illegal ones.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;People could not vote after Election Day.
 If by late votes he meant ballots counted after Tuesday, it’s routine and legal to finish counting in days ahead.
 The great number of ballots cast by mail in the pandemic and the intense interest in the election gave officials far more to count and they never finish in one day in normal times anyway.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “We have claimed, for Electoral Vote purposes, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (which won’t allow legal observers) the State of Georgia, and the State of North Carolina, each one of which has a BIG Trump lead.
 Additionally, we hereby claim the State of Michigan if, in fact ... there was a large number of secretly dumped ballots as has been widely reported.” — tweets Wednesday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: Presidents don't get to “hereby claim” election victories.
 No candidates for office do.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The U.S. government does not count the ballots in a U.S. election or conduct the vote.
 State and local officials do that.

 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;ECONOMY\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: \"Get out &amp; VOTE!
 Under my Administration, our ECONOMY is growing at the fastest rate EVER at 33.1%.
 Next year will be the GREATEST ECONOMIC YEAR in American History!
 — his final tweet of the campaign to deal with his record.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: That’s a distorted snapshot of the economy and not measure of its current performance.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The economy indeed grew by a record 33.1% annual rate in the July-September quarter but it followed the economy’s plunge in the spring and did not make up for lost ground.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The U.S. government’s estimate of third-quarter growth showed that the economy has regained only about two-thirds of the output that was lost early this year when the eruption of the virus closed businesses, threw tens of millions out of work and caused the deepest recession since the Great Depression.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Since the third quarter, the economy has been weakening again.
 Coranavirus infections have spiked, hiring has sagged and Washington’s emergency economic aid has run out, with no more help in sight this year.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, noted that the record-high third quarter growth in the nation’s gross domestic product “tells us little, if anything, about momentum” in the current quarter.
 “The strong GDP performance gives a false impression of the economy’s true health,” Daco wrote in a research note.
 Larry Hogan, a second-term Republican who has not ruled out a 2024 White House bid.
 He described the president's claims as “dangerous” and “embarrassing.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If there are legitimate challenges, we have a process, that’s the way it works,” Hogan told The Associated Press.
 “But to just make accusations of the election being stolen and widespread fraud without providing any evidence, I thought was really bad for our democratic process and it was something I had never seen in my lifetime.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Other Republicans did speak up,\" he noted, \"but certainly not enough of them.\" \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Indeed, the most aggressive Republican criticism was limited to the small and familiar group of frequent Trump critics such as Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who will not face Republican voters again for at least four years.
 “They have a perfect platform to show that they’re willing &amp; able to fight but they will cower to the media mob instead.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Several quickly raised their voices, including former South Carolina Gov.
 “That might be how you’d like to see the system work but that’s not how the system works.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As votes were tallied across the country Friday afternoon, Biden was on the cusp of winning the presidency as he opened up narrow leads in the critical battlegrounds of Georgia and Pennsylvania.
 The shifts put Biden in a stronger position to capture the 270 Electoral College votes needed to take the White House.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;With things trending in the wrong direction for him, Trump continued to spread baseless rumors of voting fraud throughout the day, calling on the Supreme Court to intervene even as his campaign struggled to produce significant evidence of malfeasance.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Still, there was no shortage of Republican leaders willing to back him up — especially after Donald Trump Jr. called out their silence on social media.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters Friday that he was “not conceding” Biden's tightening grasp on the presidency and fully supported Trump’s efforts to challenge ballot counts in several states.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Fox News the night before, Graham said he was transferring $500,000 from his campaign account to Trump’s legal fund, and called for others to make donations as well.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Ari Fleischer, a former aide to President George W. Bush, said Trump was simply saying out loud about the voting system what most losing candidates say privately.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I wish people talked with less bombast.
 But I’m not going to fault the president for it,” Fleischer said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Be gentle about Trump’s behavior,” he urged.
 “When I watched it last night and watched these heads explode I just rolled my eyes.
 ... We've always been a noisy democracy.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Yet history suggests that Trump's rhetoric and actions go well beyond the normal trappings of democracy.
 Never before has a sitting president so aggressively undermined the integrity of a U.S. election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;His strategy was entirely predictable.
 With polls showing him lagging, Trump raised questions about the integrity of the voting system for much of the year.
 Yet his words from the White House this week were no less shocking.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Even internally, some advisers did not want him to address the nation Thursday night when he made his most outrageous claims.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a staunch Trump ally, highlighted the obvious downside of Trump's questions about the integrity of the voting process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s very unfortunate that no matter who wins, the other half of America is not going to view this as a particularly legitimate election,” Johnson said on WTMJ-AM, a local radio station.
 \"I’m not saying it’s legitimate or not.
 I’m saying this process has been set up where people are not going to view it as legitimate.
 And that’s a real problem.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump spent most of Friday behind closed doors at the White House, angry about the direction of the race and insisting that his aides and allies push back.
 There was no indication he would concede, no matter what the final vote tally showed.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hogan, the Maryland governor, acknowledged that Trump would have “an important voice with the base of the Republican Party\" moving forward regardless of the 2020 election's outcome.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I’m sure he’s going to be a factor to contend with,\" Hogan said.
 “I don’t anticipate him going quietly.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Peoples reported from New York.
 AP writer Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, California, contributed to this report.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel was able to get enough votes so that neither Perdue nor Ossoff cleared the 50% threshold needed for an outright win.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Thousands of absentee ballots and in-person votes cast early needed to be counted after Election Night passed, forcing a long and tense wait before the race could be called.
 The twin races in Georgia are likely to settle which party controls the Senate.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Nationally, the Senate stands split at 48-48.
 But Republicans lead uncalled races in Alaska and North Carolina, so the ultimate balance is likely to come down to what happens in the Georgia runoffs.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Both sides promised unlimited funds would flow to the campaigns and onto the airwaves, and they predicted an all-star cast of campaigners for a state that in recent weeks drew visits from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The race between Ossoff and Perdue, a close ally of Trump, has been characterized by sharp attack ads but relatively moderate political positions.
 Both candidates steered toward the middle, vying for a state Trump won handily four years ago, but where swaths of suburbia have shown signs of disillusionment with the president.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Perdue has often focused his message on the economy, touting pre-pandemic job growth and his business experience before taking office.
 He has sought to cast Ossoff as backing a “radical socialist agenda.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Ossoff, meanwhile, has hammered Perdue's response to the coronavirus pandemic and decried Republican efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the public health crisis.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Democrats haven't won a U.S. Senate race in Georgia in two decades, but Republican dominance has been slipping.
 Democrat Stacey Abrams narrowly lost the race for governor in 2018, and Biden held a slim lead over Trump on Friday night in this year's race for the White House, though The Associated Press has not yet called the race.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Perdue’s campaign is already portraying the runoff election as a last stand for Republicans to hold the Senate majority.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The stakes in this election could not be higher: A vote for Jon Ossoff is a vote to hand power to Chuck Schumer and the radical Democrats in Washington,” Perdue campaign manager Ben Fry said in a statement Friday.
 “Georgians won’t let that happen.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Ossoff spoke at a news conference in Atlanta on Friday morning, surrounded by supporters waving signs that read, “Vote your Ossoff.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We have all the momentum.
 We have all the energy.
 We’re on the right side of history,” Ossoff said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Asked about Democrats' weak performance in recent runoff elections in Georgia, Ossoff replied: “This is a different state.
 Georgia has become younger and more diverse every day of the last decade.
 And the effort that has gone into registering voters, empowering voters is unprecedented, unmatched anywhere in the country.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Paa Coss, a 39-year-old who said she moved to Atlanta 10 years ago, came to support Ossoff wearing a shirt covered in a collage of pictures of Biden.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s so exciting,” Coss said.
 “I just see this blue wave happening — the changing demographics in my neighborhood.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“A lot of my friends from out of town are texting me.
 All eyes are on Georgia right now, which is great,” she added.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Associated Press writer Bill Barrow contributed to this report.
 Election officials, Democrats and some Republicans blanched at his baseless recitation of sinister doings and his effort to delegitimize democracy's highest calling.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Since the tide turned after election night and Democrat Joe Biden gained strength in the counting, Trump lashed out at results he didn't like, often lapsing into all-capital letters with his hectoring.
 ... We think there is going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence and so much proof.” — remarks Thursday night from the White House.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: Trump produced no evidence of systematic problems in voting or counting.
 In fact, the ballot-counting process across the country has been running smoothly for the most part, even with the U.S. in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;One of his main complaints, that counting spilled over past Election Day, is meritless.
 No presidential election has had all the votes counted the same day and there is no law or even expectation that that should be the case.
 The surge in mailed ballots and the high turnout have made the process slower than usual in some, but not all, cases.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;PENNSYLVANIA\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “In Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election and we think much more than that and they are counting those without any postmarks or any identification whatsoever.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: “Partisan Democrats” didn’t ordain this.
 It was the state Supreme Court that ruled ballots mailed before the end of Election Day could be received up to three days later and still be counted.
 It may review the matter again later.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A number of other states have also made accommodations for the crush of mailed ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “Pennsylvania Democrats have gone to the state Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers.
 ...
 They don’t want anybody in there.
 They don’t want anybody watching them while they are counting the ballots.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt; THE FACTS: That’s false.
 He is wholly misrepresenting a court case in the state.
 No one tried to ban poll watchers representing each side in the election.
 Democrats did not try to stop Republican representatives from being able to observe the process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The main issue in the case was how close observers representing the parties could get to election workers who are processing mail-in ballots in Philadelphia.
 The Trump campaign sued to allow the observers to get closer than the guidelines had allowed.
 A court ruled in favor of that request.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;MICHIGAN\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: That’s false.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Absentee ballots were counted at a downtown convention center, where some 134 counting boards were set up.
 Each party was allowed one poll watcher per board, said City Clerk Janice Winfrey.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She said she was not aware of any Republican poll watchers being removed but noted some had been “very aggressive, trying to intimidate the poll workers and processors.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Mark Brewer, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said he was inside the convention center and access was cut off to some people from both sides at one point because of capacity restrictions related to the pandemic.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;GEORGIA\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: No, the state’s elections are overseen by a Republican, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “The 11th Circuit ruled that in Georgia the votes have to be in by Election Day, that they should be in by Election Day.
 And they weren’t.
 Votes are coming in after Election Day.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: That’s not an accurate description of the ruling in question or what happened in the election in Georgia.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Although the 11th U.S.
 Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that votes must be in by 7 p.m. Election Day for them to count, an exception was made for ballots from the members of U.S. military serving overseas.
 Those could be received until 5 p.m. Friday and still count.
 Election officials in Georgia are still counting votes, but they are votes that have been lawfully received.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;NON-SHENANIGANS\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “If you count the legal votes, I easily win.
 if you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: This is baseless.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Neither Trump’s campaign aides nor election officials identified substantial numbers of “illegal” votes, much less the mammoth numbers it would take to ruin an easy win by Trump in an election where more than 140 million people voted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He frequently speaks as if mail-in voting itself is illegitimate.
 But it unfolded in accordance with state voting rules, in some cases adapted by officials to help voters get through the pandemic safely.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: \"We were winning in all the key locations by a lot, actually.
 And then our number started miraculously getting whittled away in secret.” — Thursday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: He has no foundation to make this accusation.
 The change in fortunes he speaks about is explained by the nature of vote counting in the states, not by any sudden surge of malfeasance that others have not seen.
 And it not happen in “secret” any more than his initial leads developed in secret.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Often, big cities are slower to report their numbers, and those votes tend skew Democratic.
 Likewise, many states tend to count mail-in ballots at the end of the process.
 That portion of the vote has tended to favor Biden, particularly because Trump urged his supporters in advance to avoid mail-in voting and to vote in person either early or on Election Day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump finished election night with leads in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, among the states most in play, then saw his advantage begin to fray Wednesday and past that.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “ANY VOTE THAT CAME IN AFTER ELECTION DAY WILL NOT BE COUNTED!
 — tweet Thursday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: Not true.
 Despite the tweet shout, votes received in the mail after Tuesday were counted in many places, and legally.
 Roughly 20 states allow for late-arriving ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;KELLYANNE CONWAY, unofficial Trump adviser: “Why are we in such a rush to finish this election prematurely?
 Let’s be patient.
 Let’s take a deep breath.
 Let’s count every legal vote.
 I think it’s a time to be methodical and not emotional.” — Thursday on “Fox &amp; Friends.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP, less than an hour later: “STOP THE COUNT!” — tweet.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: The count went on.
 A president doesn't control ballot counting.
 But if state and local officials had somehow stopped counting all at once, that would have frozen a tally that had Biden ahead in electoral and popular votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In reality, Trump wanted counting stopped only in undecided key states where he was ahead and Biden might catch up, not the reverse.
 Voting stopped everywhere on Tuesday, Election Day.
 Voting had even stopped in Hawaii, where the clock is five hours behind Washington, when he appeared in the East Room after 2 a.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He may have meant counting should stop.
 But state and local officials have never counted all the votes in a presidential election in one day, there is no obligation for them to do so and they did not stop in response.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“IF YOU COUNT THE LEGAL VOTES, I EASILY WIN THE ELECTION!
 IF YOU COUNT THE ILLEGAL AND LATE VOTES, THEY CAN STEAL THE ELECTION FROM US!” — statement released Thursday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: He presented no calculation to back this up, or evidence of late votes or illegal ones.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;People could not vote after Election Day.
 If by late votes he meant ballots counted after Tuesday, it’s routine and legal to finish counting in days ahead.
 The great number of ballots cast by mail in the pandemic and the intense interest in the election gave officials far more to count and they never finish in one day in normal times anyway.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “We have claimed, for Electoral Vote purposes, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (which won’t allow legal observers) the State of Georgia, and the State of North Carolina, each one of which has a BIG Trump lead.
 Additionally, we hereby claim the State of Michigan if, in fact ... there was a large number of secretly dumped ballots as has been widely reported.” — tweets Wednesday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: Presidents don't get to “hereby claim” election victories.
 No candidates for office do.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The U.S. government does not count the ballots in a U.S. election or conduct the vote.
 State and local officials do that.
 The winner of a presidential election is determined by the number of electoral votes gained in each state.
 Legal challenges are settled by courts, and may be by the Supreme Court.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As for the rest of his tweet, his leads at the time in Georgia and North Carolina were not “Big” and his substantial opening lead in Pennsylvania was coming down as more mail ballots and other ballots were counted in Democratic-leaning areas.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He was wrong to say Pennsylvania did not let observers from the campaign watch the processing of votes; it did.

 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Associated Press has not declared a winner in Georgia because the race between the Republican president and the Democratic nominee remains too early to call.
 She emphasized expanded health care in her campaign and used the momentum she built two years ago to push past McCormick, an emergency room physician and Marine veteran making his first-ever bid for office.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s the first time a Democrat has won the seat since Buddy Darden lost to Republican Bob Barr in the 1994 GOP takeover of the U.S. House, and reflects the rapidly diversifying population of the district.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;1:45 p.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;With a recount looking likely in the presidential race in Georgia, Gabriel Sterling, who oversaw the implementation of the state’s new voting system, explained how it would work during a news conference Friday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Election officials in each county will create a test deck of fake ballots and count them by hand.
 Then they will use a high-speed scanner at their central election office to scan those same ballots.
 If the tallies match and it is determined that the scanner is working accurately, all of the ballots cast in the election will be rescanned for the recount.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;This would be the first statewide recount using the new machines that are part of the voting system the state bought last year from Dominion Voting Systems for more than $100 million.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Research by The Associated Press shows that there have been at least 31 statewide recounts since 2000.
 Of those, only three changed the outcome of the election.
 The initial margins in those races were all under 300 votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;1 p.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Both Democrats and Republicans are trying to find every last person whose votes couldn’t be counted in Georgia, where the presidential contest could come down to a few hundred votes out of 5 million cast.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some absentee ballots were missing signatures.
 Some people did not have an ID at the polls.
 Some need to prove they’re properly registered.
 All must correct their ballots by 5 p.m. Friday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Thanks to a lawsuit, counties now have to contact voters so these ballots can be fixed.
 The parties also have these lists and are reaching out.
 The Associated Press went along with door-knockers in suburban Atlanta’s Gwinnett County.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They found one voter’s father, who promised to call her at college.
 At another house, they found the friend of a voter who failed to sign her ballot.
 They got her on the phone and cheered when they promised to get it done, going to county headquarters to sign it by no later than 5 p.m. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Noon\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A top Georgia elections official says they are “not seeing widespread irregularities” as the vote counting continues.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Gabriel Sterling says the process is public and transparent, with many safeguards and backed up with “paperwork on top of paperwork in many cases.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Sterling acknowledges that he’s a Republican, as is Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and says “we have people who have partisan beliefs” involved in the counting.
 But he says it’s the job of thousands of election workers across Georgia to “follow the law and assure that every legal vote is counted and the will and intent of the voters is met.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Sterling says that if you look on Facebook and Twitter, you’ll think there’s millions of problems across the country.
 He’s urging anyone with a credible complaint and some kind of evidence to call the Secretary of State’s office.
 He says investigating credible complaints “is how we’re going to build back faith in the system, that the outcome of the election is correct.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;11:30 a.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Joe Biden’s narrow lead over President Donald Trump in Georgia expanded Friday morning as vote counting continued, with about 1,500 votes separating the candidates after five million ballots were cast in the state.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“With a margin that small, there will be a recount,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Friday.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Associated Press has not declared a winner in Georgia because the race between the Republican president and the Democratic nominee remains too early to call.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Secretary of State’s office said several thousand absentee ballots were still being counted Friday.
 Also, 8,900 unreturned ballots sent to military and overseas voters could be counted if received by 5 p.m. Friday.
 Counties also have provisional ballots to review and possibly add to their totals, along with absentee ballots that need to be “cured” by voters by day’s end.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There are still “an unknowable amount of ballots” that could be counted, said Gabriel Sterling, who has overseen the implementation of Georgia’s new electronic voting system.
 He said counties have been working diligently to finish tabulating their results, and he emphasized his confidence in the legitimacy of the process.
 Any evidence-backed complaint will be investigated, he added.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“When you have a narrow margin, little, small things can make a difference.
 So everything’s going to have to be investigated to protect the integrity of the vote,” he said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;10:20 a.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Several thousand ballots remain to be counted in Gwinnett County, a Democrat-leaning county in metro Atlanta.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;County spokesman Joe Sorenson tells The Associated Press that these include roughly 4,400 absentee ballots, an estimated 1,000 ballots mailed from overseas by members of the military and nearly 1,000 provisional ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Voters whose ballots were put in the provisional pile when they voted in person because of some issue at the polls must resolve the problem Friday to have their vote counted.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;9:15 a.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Georgia’s top elections official says fewer than 8,200 absentee ballots remain to be tallied as the counting continues.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The largest batch of these are in the Atlanta suburb of Gwinnett County, with about 4,800 still to count.
 About 8,900 unreturned ballots that were sent to military and citizens overseas could be tallied as well if they arrive by 5 p.m. on Friday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s statement says strong security protocols are making sure that “the voice of every eligible voter is heard.” He says “It’s important to act quickly, but it’s more important to get it right.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;8:30 a.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Rev.
 Jesse Jackson is celebrating the way Democrat Joe Biden overtook President Donald Trump in Georgia as vote counting continues.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden took the lead when results were updated early Friday by Clayton County.
 That’s partly in Georgia’s 5th Congressional District, long held by Democrat Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights leader who died in July.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Jackson says that result is due to decades of civil rights activism in Georgia, from Dr. Martin Luther King to Stacey Abrams, who worked hard to register new voters after her run for governor.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Jackson says the fact that the 5th District put Biden ahead in the vote count shows that King and Lewis “speak from their graves today.
 The heavenly hosts rejoice.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;4:40 a.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Democrat Joe Biden is now leading President Donald Trump in the battleground state of Georgia.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;By Friday morning, Biden overtook Trump in the number of ballots counted in the battleground, a must-win state for Trump that has long been a Republican stronghold.
 Biden now has a 917-vote advantage.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The contest is still too early for The Associated Press to call.
 Thousands of ballots are still left to be counted — many in counties where the former vice president was in the lead.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;An AP analysis showed that Biden’s vote margins grew as counties processed mail ballots cast in his favor.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There is a potential that the race could go to a recount.
 The outcome in several contested states will determine whether Joe Biden defeats President Donald Trump.
 But if the Democratic challenger wins, the ambitions of a Biden presidency could well come down to Georgia.

 The contest is still too early for The Associated Press to call and thousands of ballots are left to be counted.
 Now, with his presidency on the line, he’s casting suspicion on a tool of participatory democracy — the mail-in ballot — that has allowed U.S. military personnel to vote while serving far from home since the War of 1812.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The president has shouted from Twitter to “STOP THE COUNT” and leveled unsubstantiated charges that \"surprise ballot dumps\" after election night are helping rival Democrat Joe Biden “steal” the election.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;All the while, Trump insists that military voters' mail-in ballots must be counted.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Abbot is a member of Count Every Hero, a coalition of top military brass advocating for service members' votes to be protected and properly tallied.
 He added: “It doesn’t help this democracy for (Trump) to continue to sound this alarm.
 It's inappropriate.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s unclear exactly how many mail-in military ballots remain uncounted in the undecided battleground states that will determine who will be the next president.
 More than 250,000 U.S. service members cast mail-in ballots in 2016 and even more were expected to vote by mail this time.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the 2016 presidential election, Georgia received more than 5,600 ballots from uniformed service members; North Carolina received nearly 11,000; Pennsylvania nearly 7,800 and Nevada about 2,700, according to the U.S.
 Elections Assistance Commission.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the razor-thin election in Georgia, the secretary of state’s office said as many as 8,900 ballots requested by military service members and U.S. citizens abroad — in addition to thousands that had already been received and tallied — could still arrive by Friday’s deadline.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump appeared to take notice of the number of outstanding military and overseas votes in Georgia, tweeting Friday: “Where are the missing military ballots in Georgia?
 “I know that it’s supposed to be to the advantage of the Democrats, but in all cases, they’re so one-sided.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In fact, the disparity is hardly surprising.
 Biden and other Democrats in the leadup to Election Day urged supporters to vote early and by mail because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.
 Trump urged his supporters to vote in person and he held the advantage in many states among those who cast their ballots in person on Election Day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump campaign spokeswoman Thea McDonald said the president believes “there are and should be exceptions for our military members serving our country overseas” to ensure their ballots are counted.
 But McDonald questioned why Pennsylvania election officials should be counting mail-in ballots for \"Democrats in Philadelphia who attempt to vote after Election Day.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Kristen Clark, a voting rights advocate, said the Trump campaign's suggestion to stop tallying legally cast votes for one group (civilians) while continuing the counting of ballots for another (military personnel) made no sense.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s an indefensible position to say state laws should apply to one set of voters but not to another,” said Clark, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump throughout his presidency has cast himself as a champion of military families.
 He’s relished photo ops with Gold Star families, credited himself with reducing the number of U.S. troops deployed to “endless wars,\" and poured new resources into the military.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But for some military families, Trump’s undercutting of late-arriving mail-in ballots reflects poorly on the commander in chief, even as his team has tried to clean up his broad attacks on mail-in voting.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Everybody wants the right to participate in a democracy.
 That’s why people join the military.
 It’s something we believe in strongly,” said Tori Simenec, 28, of Minneapolis, a Marine 1st lieutenant who served from 2016 until August of 2020.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Mike Jason, 47, a retired U.S. Army colonel, recalled relying on mail-in balloting through a nearly three-decade career in which he voted by mail in his home state of Florida from outposts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Germany and a series of domestic installations.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;After depending on mail-in ballots as his own personal lifeline to participation in American democracy until retiring from the Army last year, he found Trump’s attack on the integrity of mail-in voting to be infuriating.

 \"There's no evidence produced by the campaign to support there has been a lot of fraud.\" \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Even Trump's own administration has pushed back at the claims of widespread voter fraud and illegal voting - though it didn't mention Trump was the one making the allegations.
 The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, federal agency that oversees U.S. election security, also noted local election offices have detection measures that “make it highly difficult to commit fraud through counterfeit ballots.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Top election officials in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada - both Republican and Democrat - have all said they see no widespread voting irregularities, no major instances of fraud or illegal activity.
 The count is slow - but that was to be expected, because a record number of people voted by mail this year in the coronavirus pandemic.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That has not stopped the chorus of Republican leadership arguing all legal ballots must be counted, including from the Governor of Georgia, freshly re-elected Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, and the Vice President.
 There are numerous safeguards for those ballots built into the system to ensure that only voters eligible to vote can do so and that they cast only one ballot.
 An election judge from southern Illinois was charged in 2016 with voter fraud after she filled out a ballot for her late husband because she said he would have wanted Trump to be president.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;So far, there has been no evidence offered by Trump - or anyone else - of widespread fraud that would some how affect the outcome of the race.
 Local officials testified that those ballots had all been received on time.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A statewide appellate court judge in Pennsylvania on Friday dismissed a request to stop the state or counties from counting provisional ballots that were cast by voters whose mail-in ballots were disqualified by a technicality.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Nevada, a lawsuit alleges that ineligible votes were cast in the Las Vegas area, the biggest Democratic stronghold in an otherwise predominantly GOP state.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The lawsuit cites two examples: a woman who said she was turned away from voting in person because a mailed ballot had been cast with her signature, and a political strategist who said he was denied an opportunity to observe ballot counting late on election night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Nothing that I’ve seen regarding the election raises a legal issue that could succeed.
 There is just is nothing there,” said Barry Richard, who represented George W. Bush in the 2000 recount in Florida that ended up before the U.S. Supreme Court.
 “When these kind of lawsuits are filed it just breeds contempt for the whole legal system,” he said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Even if Trump did have credible evidence that there may have been fraud, he would have to show that it impacted enough ballots to make a difference in the election, Richard said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Courts don’t take up cases just to waste time,” he said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Richer reported from Boston.

 (AP) — Joe Biden's transition team isn't waiting for a verdict in the presidential race before getting to work.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As officials continue to count ballots in several undecided states, longtime Biden aide Ted Kaufman is leading efforts to ensure the former vice president can begin building out a government in anticipation of a victory.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Kaufman is a former senator from Delaware who was appointed to fill the seat vacated when Biden was elected vice president.
 He also worked on Barack Obama’s transition team in 2008, and helped write legislation formalizing the presidential transition process.
 Now, each day after the election that goes by without a declared winner is one day fewer to formally begin preparing to take over the White House.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The transition can be a frenzied process even under normal circumstances.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the meantime, an odd political limbo has taken hold.
 The Biden team is moving forward but can't tackle all that needs to be accomplished; President Donald Trump continues to claim without evidence that the election is being stolen from him.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s at least somewhat reminiscent of the 2000 presidential race and that year's post-election legal fight over the recount in Florida.
 After more than a month, the dispute between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore was decided by the Supreme Court — truncating the transition period to just 39 days before the January 2001 inauguration.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Clay Johnson, who headed Bush's transition team, said Biden’s advisers “can’t wait to be sure that the president-elect really is the president-elect.
 They have to hurry up and move forward.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Johnson said that in June of 1999 — about 17 months before Election Day 2000 — Bush approached him about heading the possible transition, having seen his father go through the process 11 years earlier.
 Prior to Election Day, Bush had already settled on Andy Card to serve as chief of staff for both the transition and at the White House.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Johnson thought they were ahead of schedule.
 But then came the recount.
 Instead, it used a former White House general counsel from the Reagan administration to conduct interviews designed to screen for potential problems that might have turned up in background checks.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"You have to assume you are it and not be presumptuous but they better be working hard as if they are it,” Johnson said of Biden’s team.
 “And they should have started doing that last Tuesday night.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden's campaign has refused to comment on the transition process.
 His closest advisers say the top priority will be announcing a White House chief of staff, then assembling the pieces needed to tackle the coronavirus.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A president gets 4,000 appointees, and more than 1,200 of them must be confirmed by the Senate.
 That could be a challenge for Biden since the Senate may well remain controlled by the Republicans.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The transition process formally starts once the General Service Administration determines the winner based on all available facts.
 That’s vague enough guidance that Trump could pressure the agency’s director to stall.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s also unclear if the president would meet personally with Biden.
 Obama met with Trump less than a week after the election, but there was no dispute about him having topped Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Whenever the process starts, Biden will have to cope with the coronavirus, which has killed more than 230,000 Americans.
 Biden has promised to use his transition period to meet with the governors of every state and ask them to impose a nationwide mask-wearing mandate.
 He says he plans to go around any holdouts to secure such rules from county and local officials.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Another key decision will be how Biden deploys his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris.
 His campaign has indicated that Biden will establish a White House-level coronavirus task force like Trump did, but it's not clear if he will tap Harris to run it.
 Vice President Mike Pence heads the current panel.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As his team awaits the results of the ballot counting, Biden is huddling in his Wilmington home with top advisers and family.

 But he may have a difficult time ever getting there.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Over the last two days, Trump has leaned in to the idea that the high court should get involved in the election as it did in 2000.
 Then, the court effectively settled the contested election for President George W. Bush in a 5-4 decision that split the court’s liberals and conservatives.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Today, six members of the court are conservatives, including three nominated by Trump.
 Trump has suggested a strategy that would focus on multiple states where the winning margins appear to be slim.
 But he might have to persuade the Supreme Court to set aside votes in two or more states to prevent Joe Biden from becoming president.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts, for his part, is not likely to want the election to come down to himself and his colleagues.
 Trump has made repeated, unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.
 Lawsuits filed by his campaign so far have been small-scale efforts unlikely to affect many votes, and some already have been dismissed.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Still, Trump has focused on the high court.
 In the early morning hours following Election Day he said: “We’ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court — we want all voting to stop.” And on Thursday, as Biden inched closer to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House, Trump again told Americans, “It’s going to end up, perhaps, at the highest court in the land, we’ll see.” On Twitter too he urged, “U.S.
 Supreme Court should decide!”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There is currently one election case at the Supreme Court and it involves a Republican appeal to exclude ballots that arrived after Election Day in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.
 Across Pennsylvania, counties reported receiving under 8,000 late mail-in ballots, though some were still assessing how many they had.
 Most of those ballots were sitting segregated waiting to be counted and were not included in vote totals, and officials were weeding out ballots that weren’t postmarked by Nov. 3.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden opened a narrow lead over Trump on Friday, and any additional mail-in votes probably would help Biden, not the president.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Still, Trump's campaign is trying to intervene in the case, an appeal of a decision by Pennsylvania’s highest court to allow three extra days for the receipt and counting of mailed ballots.
 Because the case is ongoing, the state’s top election official has directed that the small number of ballots that arrived in that window, before 5 p.m. Friday, be separated but counted.
 Republicans on Friday asked for a high court order ensuring the ballots are separated, and Justice Samuel Alito, acting on his own, agreed, saying he was motivated in part by the Republicans’ assertion that they can’t be sure elections officials are complying with guidance.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Beyond the Pennsylvania case, if Trump wanted to use a lawsuit to challenge the election outcome in a state, he’d need to begin by bringing a case in a lower court.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;So far, Trump’s campaign and Republicans have mounted legal challenges in several states, but most are small-scale lawsuits that do not appear to affect many votes.
 On Thursday, the Trump campaign won an appellate ruling to get party and campaign observers closer to election workers who are processing mail-in ballots in Philadelphia.
 But judges in Georgia and Michigan quickly dismissed two other campaign lawsuits Thursday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump and his campaign have promised even more legal action, making unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden’s campaign, meanwhile, has called the existing lawsuits meritless, more political strategy than legal.
 “I want to emphasize that for their purposes these lawsuits don’t have to have merit.
 That’s not the purpose.
 ...
 It is to create an opportunity for them to message falsely about what’s taking place in the electoral process,” lawyer Bob Bauer said Thursday, accusing the Trump campaign of “continually alleging irregularities, failures of the system and fraud without any basis.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On the other side, Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, in a call with reporters Thursday morning, said that “every night the president goes to bed with a lead” and every night new votes “are mysteriously found in a sack.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s common in presidential elections to have vote counting continue after Election Day, however.
 Now, with his presidency on the line, he’s casting suspicion on a tool of participatory democracy — the mail-in ballot — that has allowed U.S. military personnel to vote while serving far from home since the War of 1812.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The president has shouted from Twitter to “STOP THE COUNT” and leveled unsubstantiated charges that \"surprise ballot dumps\" after election night are helping rival Democrat Joe Biden “steal” the election.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;All the while, Trump insists that military voters' mail-in ballots must be counted.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Abbot is a member of Count Every Hero, a coalition of top military brass advocating for service members' votes to be protected and properly tallied.
 He added: “It doesn’t help this democracy for (Trump) to continue to sound this alarm.
 It's inappropriate.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s unclear exactly how many mail-in military ballots remain uncounted in the undecided battleground states that will determine who will be the next president.
 More than 250,000 U.S. service members cast mail-in ballots in 2016 and even more were expected to vote by mail this time.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the 2016 presidential election, Georgia received more than 5,600 ballots from uniformed service members; North Carolina received nearly 11,000; Pennsylvania nearly 7,800 and Nevada about 2,700, according to the U.S.
 Elections Assistance Commission.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the razor-thin election in Georgia, the secretary of state’s office said as many as 8,900 ballots requested by military service members and U.S. citizens abroad — in addition to thousands that had already been received and tallied — could still arrive by Friday’s deadline.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump appeared to take notice of the number of outstanding military and overseas votes in Georgia, tweeting Friday: “Where are the missing military ballots in Georgia?
 “I know that it’s supposed to be to the advantage of the Democrats, but in all cases, they’re so one-sided.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In fact, the disparity is hardly surprising.
 Biden and other Democrats in the leadup to Election Day urged supporters to vote early and by mail because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.
 Trump urged his supporters to vote in person and he held the advantage in many states among those who cast their ballots in person on Election Day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump campaign spokeswoman Thea McDonald said the president believes “there are and should be exceptions for our military members serving our country overseas” to ensure their ballots are counted.
 But McDonald questioned why Pennsylvania election officials should be counting mail-in ballots for \"Democrats in Philadelphia who attempt to vote after Election Day.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Kristen Clark, a voting rights advocate, said the Trump campaign's suggestion to stop tallying legally cast votes for one group (civilians) while continuing the counting of ballots for another (military personnel) made no sense.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s an indefensible position to say state laws should apply to one set of voters but not to another,” said Clark, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump throughout his presidency has cast himself as a champion of military families.
 He’s relished photo ops with Gold Star families, credited himself with reducing the number of U.S. troops deployed to “endless wars,\" and poured new resources into the military.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But for some military families, Trump’s undercutting of late-arriving mail-in ballots reflects poorly on the commander in chief, even as his team has tried to clean up his broad attacks on mail-in voting.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Everybody wants the right to participate in a democracy.
 That’s why people join the military.
 It’s something we believe in strongly,” said Tori Simenec, 28, of Minneapolis, a Marine 1st lieutenant who served from 2016 until August of 2020.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Mike Jason, 47, a retired U.S. Army colonel, recalled relying on mail-in balloting through a nearly three-decade career in which he voted by mail in his home state of Florida from outposts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Germany and a series of domestic installations.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;After depending on mail-in ballots as his own personal lifeline to participation in American democracy until retiring from the Army last year, he found Trump’s attack on the integrity of mail-in voting to be infuriating.

 Samuel Rodriguez, a Latino evangelical pastor who has advised Trump, said those advances with Latino voters are one reason why evangelicals should view the election as “a win” for their priorities.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I would argue, with great due deference to our president, that if we fall short, it’s not due to the evangelical agenda of life, religious liberty and biblical justice,” Rodriguez said.
 But Robert Jones, author of two books about white Christians, said there was no erosion of white evangelicals’ support for Trump and the Republican Party in this election — and that applied to both men and women in that demographic.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“They absolutely stood by their man,” said Jones, who oversees frequent surveys of religious Americans as CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, an independent Washington-based nonprofit.
 Without their political engagement, Democrats would have made greater inroads this year in states such as Texas and North Carolina, he said.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Of course, some of the president’s closest evangelical allies are not yet ready to acknowledge the prospect of a Biden victory.
 Trump is vowing to continue challenging the outcome, promoting baseless voter fraud allegations in an effort to chip at public confidence in the process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Texas-based megachurch pastor Jack Graham, a longtime Trump backer, tweeted Thursday night that he is “praying that the lies and cheating will be exposed and (Trump) will be fairly re elected.” Paula White-Cain, who serves as Trump’s personal pastor and White House faith adviser, led a prayer this week for the election and described hearing “a sound of victory.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Another top evangelical Trump supporter, Dallas megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress, said it was premature to talk about a Biden presidency, noting that Al Gore and George W. Bush spent weeks contesting the results of the 2000 election before the Supreme Court ruled in Bush’s favor.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;If Biden does become president, Jeffress said via email, “Christians would have the same responsibility to him that they have to President Trump: They should commend his good policies, condemn his bad ones, and pray for his success.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Even if defeated, Trump would remain a hero to evangelicals, said Jeffress, hailing him as “the most pro-faith president in American history.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Another evangelical leader who backed Trump, meanwhile, expressed concerns about the president’s repeated voter fraud assertions that are unsubstantiated by evidence.

 Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, said in his daily commentary Thursday that while fraud has happened in past elections, “making generalized charges of voter fraud without specifics that can be investigated, that’s quite dangerous to America as a nation.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Mohler looked ahead to the possibility of a Biden presidency coinciding with continued GOP control of the Senate, which depends on the outcome of what could be two Georgia runoff elections in January.
 He expressed hope that a division of power between the Senate and White House might thwart possible Biden policies that would worry evangelicals.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In a phone interview Friday, Mohler said pro-Trump evangelicals had differing motives for supporting a president who has so frequently departed from the traditions of his office.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There are those who see him as the answer to their prayers, and others who see him as necessary in this political emergency,” Mohler said.

 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The texts were sent using phone numbers leased to the text-messaging platform Opn Sesame, said two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition they not be further identified.
 The company’s CEO is Gary Coby, the Trump campaign’s digital director.
 It provides text-messaging services to GOP clients including the Republican National Committee.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“ALERT: Radical Liberals &amp; Dems are trying to steal this election from Trump!
 We need YOU!” the text said, directing recipients to “show your support” on a street corner near the Philadelphia Convention Center where votes were being counted and tensions were running high.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A top Trump campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the message did not come from the campaign.
 Because Opn Sesame is used by multiple customers, none of whom the company would identify, it could not be determined exactly who sent the message.
 Coby declined to comment.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Opn Sesame’s connection with the messages was first reported by The Washington Post.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Among those who received the rallying text was Chris Bray, who lives in rural Bucks County, about 25 miles outside Philadelphia.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A registered Independent who said he voted for Biden, Bray said he was very surprised to see the message pop up on his phone since he never signed up for anything related to the Trump campaign.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I actually texted a number of other friends to say ‘hey, have you guys been getting robo-texts like this?’\" Bray said Friday.

 District Attorney Larry Krasner said there were no indications they were part of an extremist group.
 Their vehicle bore a window sticker for the right-wing conspiracy theory QAnon and an AR-style rifle and ammunition inside, Outlaw said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The text messages were sent using 13 different phone numbers identified by RoboKiller, a mobile phone app that lets users block text and voice spam, said company vice president Giulia Porter.
 RoboKiller traced the numbers to Twilio, a gateway for bulk-messaging services.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;After being notified, Twilio shut down the numbers, saying in a statement that the texts “were sent without consumer opt-out language, which is in direct contravention of our policies.” A company spokesman declined further comment.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;About 80 million political text messages have been sent daily since September in the U.S. — many of those from the Trump camp echoing his baseless claims that Democrats were trying to steal the election, said RoboKiller’s Porter.
 They are highly targeted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Political text-messaging campaigns can exploit the same flaws in telecommunications infrastructure that let robocallers hide their origin.

 Some have handguns.
 Often, they carry black, military-style semiautomatic rifles.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The protesters with weapons are a small minority of the demonstrators.
 There have been no reports of anyone getting shot, and the laws in Arizona, Nevada and Michigan — where guns have been seen outside vote-tabulation centers in recent days — allow people to openly carry firearms in public.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But in a nation increasingly inured to weapons at rallies -- most often carried by right-wing demonstrators, though also sometimes by left-wing protesters — experts warn that the guns create a dangerous situation that could be seen as intimidation or tip easily into violence.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The more we see, the more people see it as a normal reaction — even though it’s not.
 There’s nothing normal about it,\" said Cynthia Miller-Idriss, a professor at American University who studies extremism.
 “The potential for violence becomes normalized.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The armed protesters have shown up at the vote-counting centers in response to groundless accusations from President Donald Trump that the Democrats are trying to steal the election.
 No serious irregularities have been reported.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Elections officials in several states where Democrat Joe Biden was ahead said the anger outside their doors made them fear for the safety of their employees.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Those carrying weapons insist they are keeping the peace.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I’m here to protect a peaceful protest,” said Keith Owen, who carried a black, semiautomatic assault rifle and wore a handgun in a holster strapped to his leg.
 His vest held extra ammunition.
 He described himself as a veteran who served in Afghanistan and now lives in Arizona.
 We want to make sure all the legal ballots are counted, and fairly,” said another rifle-bearing protester, Travis Fillmore, 34, a military veteran from Tempe, Arizona.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Arrest the poll workers!” the crowd chanted, demanding four more years in office for Trump.
 Some carried signs that read, “Make Elections Fair Again” and “We Love Trump.” Police cordoned off streets leading to the building and maintained a close watch on the protest.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The county treasurer in Detroit, Eric Sabree, said he had closed his office because of threats.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Michigan voters have the right to vote in person on Election Day free from threat and intimidation,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement when the order was announced.
 “An armed presence at the polls is inconsistent with our notion of a free democracy.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;About 100 people gathered Friday at a vote-tabulation center in Las Vegas for a pro-Trump demonstration, with at least two men in fatigues seen carrying rifles that hung from shoulder straps.
 At least 20 uniformed officers standing nearby watched the demonstrators.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Philadelphia, two men with handguns were arrested Thursday night near the convention center where the vote-counting was going on.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The men, ages 42 and 61, had driven up in a Hummer from Virginia and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said.
 A military-style rifle and ammunition were found inside their vehicle, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said.
 The car had a window sticker for the right-wing conspiracy theory QAnon.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;District Attorney Larry Krasner did not say why the men had come to Philadelphia but said there were no indications they were part of an extremist group.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Weapons have become an increasingly common sight over the past year across the U.S., amid widespread protests for racial justice and anger over coronavirus restrictions.
 Armed demonstrators have protested COVID-19 lockdowns at the state capitols of Wisconsin and Minnesota and outside small businesses in Texas.
 Groups of armed men walked repeatedly through downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, insisting they were just out for exercise.
 A few days ago in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a man carrying a semi-automatic rifle was among a group of demonstrators at an anti-Trump rally.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Michigan, armed demonstrators angry about COVID-19 restrictions went into the state Capitol building earlier this year, standing in the Senate gallery and looking down on lawmakers.
 They are mostly the white working class from factory towns, farms and mining communities that Trump has elevated to near-mythic status as the “forgotten Americans.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They are disaffected and disconnected from conventional politics.
 A Democratic surge of votes in cities and suburbs could quickly erase that narrow lead.
 To hold onto Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes, the president needs to prove that a hidden groundswell of supporters exists — and will vote.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the math behind the theory is tight.
 Trump’s plan requires blowout victories and historic turnout in conservative strongholds across the state, places where he outperformed traditional Republicans four years ago and he knows must do even better.
 His mission is made clear by his campaign stops in Pennsylvania this week — a tour through GOP areas like Latrobe, Lititz and Martinsburg, \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Trump has to drive turnout,” said Terry Madonna, a professor at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster who has conducted polls in the state for almost three decades.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s handling of the virus has cost him support among suburban women and older voters.
 His response to the civil unrest reacting to police killings of Black men only served to energize the resolve of Black women, as candidates and as voters.
 His wrecking-ball persona has prompted some of his backers in 2016 to reject him.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;So his fate lies in large part in places like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, conservative county north of Pittsburgh.
 There are nearly two Republicans for each registered Democrat.
 Most adults did not graduate from college.
 But local Republicans say the goal is to push that number as high as 90% this year.
 And they’ve spent several months registering new Republicans, adding 9,043 of them this year alone, for a 12.8% increase.
 Trump’s campaign is trying to replicate those kinds of numbers in other rural and exurban counties in the state.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Al Lindsay, a 74-year-old trial lawyer and farmer who leads the Butler County Republicans, says that registration push has been made easy by frustrations over pandemic lockdowns and a growing belief that Democrats don't understand people who are religious and rural.
 His pitch is simple: “Look, there’s an urgency here.
 There is still a baseball field at the historic Pullman Park, but the company closed its railcar factory in 1982.
 Its towns’ Main Streets recall an era when America was ascendant.
 The wire rope that holds up the Brooklyn Bridge was made in Butler County.
 So was the prototype for the Jeep deployed in World War II.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Republicans have been operating three campaign offices in the county — a declaration of their intention to dominate.
 Slippery Rock Mayor Jondavid Longo pushed to open one of those offices in his town of 3,600.
 It sits opposite North Country Brewing, the town’s second-largest employer after Slippery Rock University, where Longo, a former Marine infantryman, attended college.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Longo, 30, was elected mayor of Slippery Rock in 2017 by promising to keep taxes low and attract new businesses.
 The Republican knocked on 1,000 doors on the premise — similar to Trump's — that the key to winning was finding people who had tired of politics.
 Trump “has given us an energy that says, Don’t back down, stand up for what’s right,” Longo said.
 “Open your mouth when you feel compelled to do so.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The mayor has aimed to turn out younger voters, a group that normally favors Democrats.
 But in Butler County, there are almost twice as many Republicans under 35 as there are Democrats — and their perspectives veer from the politics of their peers across the country.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Most dear to me, first and foremost, would be abortion — obviously, pro-life,” said Adam Jones, 19, a sophomore at Slippery Rock University who plans to cast his first vote for Trump.
 Behind that, Jones says, he prioritizes the Second Amendment and “resisting socialism.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Tyler Good, 21, was a month too young to vote for Trump in 2016 and is among the Trump voters who’ve been added to the rolls.
 He’s a Baptist, works as a photocopier technician and hunts deer with a .270 Remington rifle.
 He says Trump is appealing because he broke the mold of what a president can be.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“He’s not a politician,” Good said.
 “He does get stuff done.
 He’s a businessman, you know.
 He doesn’t mess around, it seems.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Republicans like Longo are also hunting for voters like Dane Patricelli, a 27-year-old construction worker who leans conservative but cast his ballot in 2016 for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Patricelli said Trump seemed like too much of a wild card in 2016.
 He wrestled for months with his decision this year, believing that Biden was a moderate even if the Democrats were drifting leftward.
 But he ultimately decided last week — after the last debate — that Trump had earned his vote.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I do like Trump because he’s shaken things up and is not bought and paid for,” he said.
 Barrickman said she voted Republican four years ago but can’t this time around.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There is just too much division in this country,” she said.
 “If you’re a leader, you don’t incite, you quiet the storm.
 I know all politicians lie, cheat and scam — but it’s just too much to me.
 Biden — he’s calmer, he doesn’t spew with the hate.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Trump campaign has long known its best shot at winning was finding new voters in its strongholds, rather than persuading swing Democrats or independents.
 They used Trump’s raucous rallies in small towns and places that rarely get presidential attention to attract those voters to an unconventional campaign.
 They launched a voter registration and data collection effort around those events.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There are signs of success: In Florida, the party has registered 475,500 Republicans over the past four years, outpacing gains of 395,600 for Democrats.
 The campaign has claimed that as many as a quarter of attendees at rallies did not vote in 2016.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But in Pennsylvania, Democrats still outnumber Republicans by more than 700,000 registered voters, and there are an additional 1.3 million who are not associated with either party.
 And an Associated Press analysis of voting in key counties demonstrates the hurdles the GOP faces to overcome Democratic enthusiasm.
 About 11% of them decided to cast a ballot in this year’s Republican primary, in which Trump ran unopposed, according to the analysis using data from L2, a political data firm.
 That’s a strong indicator that those voters are likely to vote again this year.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A similar pattern played out in 10 major Republican counties in Pennsylvania: Just over 10% of registered Republicans who sat out 2016 voted in the 2020 primary.
 That translates into nearly 14,000 voters.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The obstacle for Trump is that Democrats — they had a competitive presidential primary — have more voters and generated a better return rate.
 There are 258,000 Democrats who were registered but did not vote in Philadelphia and its surrounding counties in 2016.
 But during this year’s primary, more than 34,300 of them became voters and cast ballots.
 That’s more than double the gains in Republicans from the 10 leading Trump counties.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“For both campaigns, they’re seeing an acceleration of the trends we saw in 2016,” said Christopher Nicholas, a veteran Republican strategist.
 “Biden is doing better in the suburbs across the state.
 The Trump campaign is doing better in rural and exurban Pennsylvania.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;While Democrats stopped most in-person campaigning as the virus peaked during the spring and summer, Republicans were quick to resume an aggressive ground game in Butler County as early as May.
 The campaign groomed “super volunteers” tasked with pushing turnout to a record, borrowing from the same playbook as Democrat Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, said Brittney Robinson, director of the Trump campaign’s Pennsylvania operations.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Many of the Republican volunteers in Butler County are women, and their message is that Democrats just don’t understand parts of the country where schools close for the start of hunting season, said Trish Lindsay, the wife of the local party chairman as well as the vice-chair.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It is the way of life that this election is about — and that is what is dividing people,” she said.
 His supporters said the restrictions set by Democratic Gov.
 Tom Wolf were an overreach that shuttered restaurants and hurt businesses.
 The issues motivating them include abortion, gun ownership and the continued fracking of natural gas — all areas where Trump has delivered for his base and Biden is perceived as a risk.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“You start with the proposition that most of the people here are very alienated by the Democratic Party,” explained Al Lindsay, the party chair and Trish’s husband.

 She wears nothing fussy, the battle fatigues of her troupe: yoga pants and sneakers.
 She left her Lincoln Aviator idling in the driveway, the driver door open -- if this house wasn’t the one to save the nation, she can move quickly to the next.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;For most of her life, until 2016, Lori Goldman had been politically apathetic.
 Had you offered her $1 million, she says, she could not have described the branches of government in any depth.
 She voted, sometimes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Now every moment she spends not trying to rid America of President Donald Trump feels like wasted time.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We take nothing for granted,” she tells her canvassing partner.
 “They say Joe Biden is ahead.
 Nope.
 She feels responsible for the country’s future: Trump won Michigan in 2016 by 10,700 votes and that helped usher him into the White House.
 Goldman believes people like her -- suburban white women -- could deliver the country from another four years of chaos.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;For many of those women, the past four years have meant frustration, anger and activism — a political awakening that powered women's marches, the #MeToo movement and the victories of record numbers of female candidates in 2018.
 That energy has helped create the widest gender gap — the political divide between men and women — in recent history.
 And it has started to show up in early voting as women are casting their ballots earlier than men.
 That’s loser talk.
 You can be right all day, but if you’re not winning, what’s the point?\u003c/div&gt;\u003cp&gt;That could mean trouble for Trump, not just in Oakland County but also in suburban battlegrounds outside Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Phoenix.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump has tried to appeal to “the suburban housewives of America,” as he called them.
 Embracing fear and deploying dog whistles, he has argued that Black Lives Matter protesters will bring crime, low-income housing will ruin property values, suburbs will be abolished.
 Campaigning in Pennsylvania last week, he begged: “Suburban women, will you please like me?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There's no sign all this is working.
 Some recent polls show Biden winning support from about 60% of suburban women.
 In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton won 52%, according to an estimate by the Pew Research Center.
 The Black executive who fears for the safety of her sons.
 The Democrat who voted for Trump in 2016 but now describes him as “a terrible person.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Together, they create a powerful political force.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Goldman started her group, Fems for Dems, in early 2016 by sending an email to a few hundred friends that said she planned to help elect the first female president and asked if they’d like to join her.
 Four years later, their ranks have swelled to nearly 9,000.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There is one thing Goldman gives Trump credit for.
 He stormed into the White House on pure guts and bombast, unwilling to acknowledge failure, averse to saying sorry.
 Those are not natural traits for most women who’ve absorbed societal expectations to please and be polite, she says.
 But she dug deep within herself to find some hint of them.
 She also peppers almost every sentence with curse words and no longer gives one damn what people think.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I hate the saying, ‘When they go low, we go high.’ That’s loser talk,” she says.
 “You can be right all day, but if you’re not winning, what’s the point?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;And it’s worked: She described her coalition to a newspaper once as “a bunch of dumpy, middle-aged housewives,” and a few got mad at her, but far more joined.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But she is terrified that the constant cycle of crises has left many women exhausted and that could stall this leftward lurch.
 The nation is reeling from a pandemic and protests, the death of a revered Supreme Court justice, the hospitalization of the president, a foiled plot to kidnap Michigan’s governor.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Our house is on fire,” Goldman says, and so she steers her SUV to the next door on the cul de sac.
 Goldman has covered nearly every inch of it.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Although Clinton won here in 2016, she won fewer votes than Barack Obama four years earlier, while the third-party vote soared.
 If Clinton had matched Obama’s total, Oakland County alone might have cut Trump’s margin of victory in Michigan by more than half.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But in 2018, some political scientists described it as the epicenter of a major political shift as women turned on Republicans.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Women are pragmatic voters,” said Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.
 “We care about our kids.
 We care about our parents.
 We care about economic security.
 And so candidates who stand up for those values and show that they can be good, decent human beings is something I know resonates.
 That same year, Democrat Elissa Slotkin flipped a congressional seat that was under Republican control for almost 20 years.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some of Slotkin’s strongest supporters were Republican women.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Nancy Strole, a longtime elected township clerk in the rural northern part of the county, had not been able to bring herself to vote for Trump.
 She considers herself an “old-fashioned kind of Republican.” She hasn’t changed, she said — her party was “hijacked.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s not just Trump,” she said.
 “It wouldn’t happen unless there are others who acquiesced and were willing to go along with it either by their silence, by their lack of will, by their lack of courage.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When Trump began his presidency by undermining international alliances and routinely denigrating people, she grew frustrated that Republicans did nothing about it.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Strole said she called her congressman, Mike Bishop, and never heard back.
 Meanwhile, Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, announced her bid against Bishop.
 Her reason for running jibed with Strole’s growing consternation: She had watched Bishop stand by at the White House, smiling, as Republicans worked to gut the Affordable Care Act.
 But she knocked on 1,000 doors for Slotkin.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Andrea Moore, by contrast, was raised in a Democratic family.
 But she voted for Trump because she was fed up with career politicians who seemed interested only in money and power.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“He was an unknown quantity, but now we know,” said Moore, 45, who lives in a suburban community in Wayne County.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She can’t remember the precise moment she decided she’d made a mistake.
 It felt like a toxic relationship: You can make excuses for a while, but eventually disgust settles in.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“A million little things,” she said — the rapid-fire attacks on people, divisiveness, fear mongering.
 “They just kind of piled up.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She can’t understand how anyone could support Trump after his response to his own bout with COVID-19 — how he flouted masks and held rallies, downplayed the threat, failed to acknowledge that he had access to treatments that others don’t, she said.
 All this when more than 219,000 Americans have died.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Moore, a stay-at-home mom who home-schools her 9-year-old son, doesn’t love Biden.
 But if the choice is between Trump and anyone else, she said, anyone else will do.
 She hopes the administration will be driven by Kamala Harris — a Black woman, the child of immigrants, young, sharp.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s been an old white guy’s game for way too long,” Moore said.
 He has warned that “Biden will destroy your neighborhood and your American dream.” He revoked an Obama-era housing initiative meant to curtail racial segregation, claiming that property values would diminish, crime would rise and suburbs would “go to hell.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I think if this were 1950, his message would be perfect,” said Karyn Lacy, a sociologist at the University of Michigan.
 “The problem is it’s not 1950.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s description of the suburbs seems to Alison Jones like nostalgia for “a `Leave it to Beaver’ time” when people who look like her could not have lived in her subdivision, where no house costs less than $1 million.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Now when Jones, a Black woman, sees Trump lawn signs, she wonders: Do her neighbors really want her here?
 Even now, Oakland County remains very white, but not as white as it once was.
 In 1990, the county was 88% white.
 By 2019, that dropped to 71.5%.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Jones watched as Trump stood on a debate stage and declined to condemn white supremacy, telling a hate group to “stand back and stand by.” She was a child in the South in the 1960s, when schools were integrating, and the message felt very familiar: It’s us against them.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She fears for her two sons, maybe even more in this predominantly white community than she would in a city, she said.
 In 2018, a Black 14-year-old boy got lost not far from where she lives and knocked on a door to ask for directions.
 The white homeowner shot at him.
 Police killings have exposed systemic racism, COVID-19 has disproportionally killed Black people, and they have borne the brunt of the economic fallout, too.
 “I think 2020 has opened the wounds, pulled back the curtain so we can see what’s really here.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;An executive at a Fortune 500 company, Jones moved here for the same reason as everybody else: good schools, secure property values, safety.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;And like Jones, many women here work outside the home.
 Households aren’t all as they were depicted when Beaver and Wally lived in the fictional town of Mayfield.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Linda Northcraft moved to Oakland County in 1997 for a job as a rector of an Episcopal church, and bought a home with her partner, Ellen Ehrlich.
 “Gay priest splits parish,” the headline read.
 Skinheads protested in the parking lot.
 It was devastating, and some from their old church suggested maybe they should move back to Baltimore.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But they stayed, times changed, and they got married.
 Ehrlich said “my wife” recently to a stranger and reported back to Northcraft: “They didn’t even blink an eye,” she said.
 “It’s become normal.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They became active in Democratic politics when Whitmer was running for governor.
 Before dinner, they pray for people sick from COVID-19, for Biden and Harris and, until recently, for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Ehrlich had been in a “mini state of depression.” She’s an extrovert and the shutdown to curtail the spread of the coronavirus had left her demoralized.
 But Ginsburg’s death energized her.
 Without even speaking of it, they both understood the stakes: A stronger conservative majority on the Supreme Court could undo years of expanding protections for civil rights — including their own right to be married.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They sat down the next morning and made campaign donations to every Democrat they could think of.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She’s hungry because she often doesn’t take the time to eat.
 Her knee aches from a replacement surgery six months ago.
 Often the houses have Trump flags hanging from the porch rails.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“But this is war,” she says, and she considers herself a street fighter.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;People look at her and make assumptions, she said: a $2 million house, fancy car, American Express black card that she always loses because she keeps it in her bra.
 But she grew up in a steel town not far away, one of six kids raised by a single mother, poor, dependent on government cheese.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Most of her family and childhood friends are Trump supporters, so she knows there are many whose minds she won’t change.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Like Ally Scully, 27, who hesitantly voted for him in 2016.
 She believes in traditional small-government Republican ideals like tax cuts and supporting small business.
 She prayed over her decision and walked into the booth still unsure.
 Now she thinks he earned her vote again.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I’m surprised to be saying that because I didn’t think he would,” she said.
 Scully, who now leads the county’s young Republican club, acknowledges that many women have fled the GOP under Trump.
 But she also believes another, quieter contingent is going the other way.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Goldman worries that she’s right.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But then again, some things have happened to spur more women to battle Trump.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Earlier this month, her phone started ringing one morning with call after call from women asking to knock on doors with her.
 The catalyst: Six men were charged with conspiring to kidnap Gov.
 Whitmer because of her “uncontrolled power.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Whitmer has been a persistent target of right-wing vitriol since she implemented a strict lockdown to try to contain the coronavirus.
 Thousands of men stormed into the Capitol with guns.
 Trump egged them on: “Liberate Michigan,” he tweeted, dismissing Whitmer as “the woman from Michigan.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Whitmer felt it was her duty to publicly blame Trump.
 Most women, she said, have been on the receiving end of belittling comments.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I’m at a point in my life where I’m going to take it on every time,” she said.
 “There’s no room for it.
 I don’t have time to waste.
 I have a job to do.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Women approached her at events to thank her, she said.
 Some said they were Republicans, tired of the divisiveness and determined to make a change.
 “It’s because she’s a woman who dared to speak up and so now a bunch of men are going to teach her a lesson,” she said.
 “This is the violent version of mansplaining, and it’s happened since Adam and Eve.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;So Goldman conjures her Trumpian bluster.
 Sometimes she stands up in the middle of Starbucks and bellows, “Who here can’t take it anymore?
 Who wants this guy out of office?” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some fraction of the room will be furious, but that’s OK with her, because some fraction will ask how they can help.
 Fems for Dems swells.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Her group has about 8,900 members.
 But that’s not what Trump would say, so it’s not what she does, either.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Over 9,000,” she says.
 “And growing.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___ \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Associated Press journalists David Eggert, Hannah Fingerhut, Emily Swanson and Angeliki Kastanis contributed to this report.

 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Davis was stunned.
 A former kindergarten teacher and librarian, she was more accustomed to shuttling her two sons to basketball practice than being seen as a local celebrity.
 But now she had been elected the only Black woman on the Cobb County School Board, gaining office in a once conservative suburban community where people who look like her rarely held positions of power.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Something had changed in this place, and something had changed in her.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I love your hair — your hair looks like my hair,” the girl squealed, calling friends over.
 It’s a momentous change that could make history on a national ticket and determine the outcome of the presidential race.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;EDITOR’S NOTE — Americans are preparing to choose a leader and a path through a time of extraordinary division and turmoil.
 Associated Press journalists tell their stories in the series “America Disrupted.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Black women have long been the heart of the Democratic Party — among the party’s most reliable and loyal voters — but for decades that allegiance didn’t translate to their own political rise.
 There have been zero Black female governors, just two senators, several dozen congresswomen.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;And the people representing them instead have not met their needs: Disparities in education and opportunity resulted in Black women making on average 64 cents for every dollar a white man makes.
 Long-standing health inequities have caused Black people to die disproportionately from COVID-19.
 Over the last several years and across America, Black women ran and won elections in historic numbers, from Congress to county school boards.
 Places like Cobb, a rambling expanse of strip malls and subdivisions just north of Atlanta that doubled in population midway through the last century as white people fled the city.
 Then, slowly, families of color followed, also seeking bigger yards and better schools.
 Now it’s more than 27% Black and 13% Hispanic.
 Its politics caught up with its demographics: In 2016 Hillary Clinton was the first Democratic presidential candidate to eke out a win in Cobb County since Jimmy Carter, a Georgian, in 1976.
 They added their names to down-ticket ballots; they canvassed; they knocked on doors.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When Stacey Abrams, a Black progressive Democrat, ran for governor in 2018, she focused her campaign on women of color.
 In that election, more than 51,000 Black women in Cobb County cast ballots — 20,000 more than voted in midterm elections four year earlier.
 Meanwhile, Lucy McBath, a Black mother whose 17-year-old son was killed by a white man who thought his music was too loud, won a congressional seat that includes part of the county, a district once held by conservative firebrand Newt Gingrich.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Charisse Davis looked at the school board members and saw no Black women, so she ran and won.
 Another Black woman became the chair of the county’s young Republicans.
 Two joined the Superior Court bench.
 A teenager ran for class president, and she won, too.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We’ve been watching from the sidelines and allowing other people to take their turns, and take these positions of power,” Davis said.
 We had to be together, we had to grieve and yell,” Davis said.
 “What happened?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Across the county, there was soul searching over how Clinton lost white, working-class voters, but much less on why Democrats also lost some of the support of this core constituency.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Historically Black women vote in extraordinary numbers, and they don’t vote alone: They usher their families, their churches, their neighbors to the polls.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But in 2016, African Americans did not turn out in the numbers the party had come to expect.
 For the first time in 20 years, their turnout declined in a presidential election.
 About 70% of eligible Black women voted in 2012 when President Barack Obama, the first Black president, secured a second term.
 Organizations sprang up across the country to motivate Black women to organize, run and win.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We have never been at this moment,” said Aimee Allison, who in 2018 founded the network She the People, which is working to turn out a million women of color across seven battleground states.
 Black women made up about one-third of the Democratic voters in the state and roughly two-thirds voted for Biden, according to the AP VoteCast survey.
 He has responded to mass demonstrations over police violence by calling protesters thugs and encouraging law enforcement to beat them back with force.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Given how directly Black women have been impacted by the incompetence and the malfeasance of the Trump administration, Black women are going to be at the forefront, not only giving rise to voter turnout, but also shaping the conversations that we will be having in this election season,” said Abrams, whose name has also been widely circulated as a possible Biden running mate.
 “It has been a sea change in how vital our voices have been.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Black women can meet this moment in a way no one else can, they say: The world watched the video of George Floyd begging for his mother as he was dying under a police officer’s knee.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Charisse Davis’ sons, 10 and 14 years old, asked her: Why won’t the officer just let him get up?\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When she looks at her own sons, she sees her babies.
 But the older boy is now taller than she is.
 He likes hoodies.
 She worries a stranger might see him as a menace, not a boy whose mother still has to remind him to floss his teeth.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“That is the reality of being a Black mother in this country,” she said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She gets messages after school board meetings: “People like you are the problem,” one said.
 “She’s a racist,” a man wrote.
 Another described her as “defiant,” and said he had his son watch school board meetings “to see how he shouldn’t behave.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She hears: You don’t belong there.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“You are dismantling the machine, rocking the boat, and all of those things are the way that they are by design,” she said, and added that one of the high schools in the district she represents is named after a Confederate officer.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“That is what the country is built on, that is racism, that is systemic racism, that is white supremacy.
 It’s all these things we don’t talk about.
 He had been a football star there.
 But someone saw two Black men and called the police to report suspicion.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She posted her son’s story on Facebook, and it rocketed around this community.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the not-so-distant past, she might not have spoken up.
 A soccer mom and educator, she had long avoided talking about race, rocking the boat — until Trump won.
 Now she’s the president of Cobb Democratic Women and leading the charge to try to turn the county totally blue.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s all about knowing your worth,” she said.
 “We’ve always been here, like the Underground Railroad.
 But it’s surfaced now.
 In a big way.
 It’s a rail train.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Black women powered the civil rights movement, but rarely became its stars.
 Women like Fannie Lou Hamer, Diane Nash, Myrlie Evers, Ella Baker and Dorothy Height never held political office, but they played a critical role, said Nadia Brown, a Purdue University political science professor.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the landscape changed dramatically over the last several cycles.
 Just two years ago, five Black women were elected to Congress, four of them in majority-white districts, according to the Higher Heights Black Women in American Politics 2019 survey.
 Congress now has more Black women than ever before: 22 congresswomen and one senator, Kamala Harris, who is just the second to serve in that chamber and a prominent contender to be Biden’s running mate.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The change has extended to state and local offices.
 Two black women are running for governor in Virginia, and if either of them win, she would become the nation’s first Black female governor.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Cobb County, Kellie Hill made history in June as one of two Black women elected to the Superior Court bench.
 When she first moved to Georgia 30 years ago, fellow lawyers assumed she was her secretary’s assistant.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I said for years, ‘Maybe one day they’ll be ready for me,’” Hill said.
 They account for less than 5% of officeholders elected to statewide executive offices, Congress and state legislatures, according to the Higher Heights survey.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Black women have done everything that America told us was going to make us successful and we’re still at the bottom in terms of our return,” said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Black women are posting faster educational gains than any other demographic group in the U.S. — seeing a 76% jump in the number of college degrees earned over the past 20 years, but they aren’t reaping the promised economic benefits.
 On average, Black women made 64 cents for every dollar a white man makes.
 But that drops to 55 cents for Black women with a professional degree compared to white men with the same level of educational attainment.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“People told us that education is key to being successful,” Brown said.
 “What did Black women do?
 Black women, out of any constituency group in this country, we enter college more than any other group in this country.
 Her family’s roots in Cobb County go back more than 100 years.
 Her parents went to segregated schools and sipped out of separate water fountains.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Once, when Jackson was a little girl, she sat down at a lunch counter because she wanted a cherry Coke.
 The waitress just passed her by, refusing to serve her.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Now Black women around her are daring to run, to win and to demand their leaders fix the broken system that maintains disparities in policing, health care, education, economics.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“You have taken our votes for granted for years.
 But guess what?” she said.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;DeAnna Harris was recently elected chair of the Cobb County Young Republicans, the first Black person in the post.
 To highlight local Black Republicans — the district attorney, deputy sheriff, a former state representative — she held her inaugural event at the historic African American church she attends.
 The crowd was diverse, she said, and she was proud of that.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She tries to make a conservative pitch to other Black voters by touting the ideals she believes in: small government, gun rights, religious freedom, anti-abortion.
 The response is generally something along the lines of, “but I don’t like Trump.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“He’s never served the role of politician, who gets up there and smiles and says all the right things and winks at the camera, and then when you turn around they stab you in the back,” Harris said.
 Though she doesn’t like his tone or his tweets, she supports Trump because of his conservative policies.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But she also believes it’s imperative that Republicans broaden their base.
 Fair Fight Action, the organization Abrams founded, calculated that Georgia has more than 750,000 new voters who were not registered in 2018, 49% of them voters of color.
 And despite a pandemic and hourslong lines in some polling places, more Democrats voted in June’s presidential primary than in 2008, when Obama was on the ticket.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That Democratic energy can be particularly seen in these northern Atlanta suburbs.
 McBath, the incumbent in the 6th Congressional District, ran unopposed and got 26,000 more primary votes than the five Republicans candidates combined.
 In Cobb County, almost 33,000 African Americans voted in the 2016 primary.
 In the 2020 primary: more than 52,000.
 Both of the state’s Republican senators are up for election, putting Georgia on the front lines of the fight for control of the Senate.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The 2020 election cycle is going to be key to changing the course of history in this country,” said Nikema Williams, chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia, who was selected to replace Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights leader who died in July, on the November ballot.
 Gabby Bashizi was one of thousands of teenagers who plotted on the social media site TikTok to reserve tickets to Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, then not show up.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump said he expected a million fans to attend.
 There were about 6,000, and lots of empty seats.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I think he’s really dangerous,” said Bashizi, 17.
 Her father is an immigrant from Congo, so it feels personal every time Trump calls immigrants criminals or Black Lives Matter protesters “thugs.” “We all feel it.
 We all go home scared.
 Is it going to be me next?”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When she was younger she struggled to find self-worth.
 No Disney princesses looked like her.
 People touched her hair, like it was a strange curiosity.
 In the sixth grade, she buzzed it to the width of a bottle cap, and cried and cried.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Then she started seeing Black women ascend.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Seeing them fight their fight on the national stage has led me to be able to fight my fight on a personal level,” she said.
 McNeal ran to be the class president at her mostly white high school, and lost.
 She thought of a poem she once wrote about a princess envious of her brother because one day he would be king; she wanted to be powerful.
 She ran again, and won.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s about time we represent ourselves,” McNeal said.
 Now she’s a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.
 She’s heading to Barnard College to study politics.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She thinks she’ll be secretary of state one day.

 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But that doesn't mean Black women are “typical” Democrats.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;An AP analysis of the VoteCast data reveals that Black women's views often stand out as more moderate than the rest of the party.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Black women are less likely to identify as liberal, somewhat less likely to support abortion rights, far less concerned about climate change and somewhat more likely to prioritize jobs and the economy.
 They are also more protective of President Barack Obama's policies and legacy.
 Black women came out in force to vote for the moderate in the Democratic presidential primary, Obama’s former vice president, Joe Biden, and rescued his bid.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A closer look at how Black women are shaping the Democratic Party:\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;IDEOLOGY\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In its survey of 2018 midterm voters who identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party, VoteCast shows that Black women were much less likely than others to call themselves liberal (42% vs 60%) and more likely to call themselves moderate (43% vs 34%) or conservative (13% vs 5%).
 The pattern is similar among Black men.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Similarly, across 17 states where AP VoteCast was conducted in the 2020 primary elections, Black voters were more likely to say they preferred voting for a candidate who would restore the political system to the way it was before President Donald Trump took office (52%) than for a candidate who would fundamentally change politics in Washington (46%).
 Other Democratic voters were more likely to prefer the reverse, 54% to 44%.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It's a key difference that demonstrates the group's power in the party's nomination process.
 After poor performances in Iowa and New Hampshire left Joe Biden's candidacy on life support earlier this year, Black voters — and Black women in particular — spurred the former vice president to a decisive victory in South Carolina.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But Black women stand out in their ranking of other priorities.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Within the Democratic coalition, Black women were somewhat more likely than other Democrats to call the economy and jobs (18% to 12%) or gun policy (19% to 12%) the top issue facing the country.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They were also less likely than others to call the environment the top issue, 4% vs 14%, and much less likely to call themselves very concerned about climate change, 56% vs 75%.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There's also a distinction on abortion rights.
 Nearly 1 in 4 Black female Democrats said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases.
 That's compared to about 15% of other Democrats.
 That may reflect in part the fact that their religious views differ from other members of the party.
 Black women were more likely than other Democrats to call themselves born-again Christians, 51% to 16%, and less likely to say they don't identify with any religion, 13% vs 33%.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On immigration, Black women aligned with other Democrats on whether immigrants living illegally in the U.S. should be given the opportunity to apply for legal status — about 9 in 10 Democratic voters across racial and gender groups support the idea.
 But Black women were somewhat more likely to be critical of immigrants' impact on the country.
 Nineteen percent of Black women Democrats said immigrants do more to hurt than help the country, compared to 13% of other Democrats.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;RACE\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Black female Democrats, and Black Democrats in general, also differ from other Democrats in their views of the role race plays in U.S. society — and on what to do about it.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Among 2018 voters, VoteCast shows that Black female Democrats were more likely than other Democrats to say that white Americans have more advantages than Black Americans in U.S. society today, 87% to 73%.
 Among black male Democrats, 81% said white Americans have more advantages than Black Americans.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In seven states where the question was asked in the 2020 primaries, about 8 in 10 Black voters — men and women alike — said they favored making reparations payments to the descendants of enslaved people, compared with about 4 in 10 non-Black Democrats.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;HEALTH CARE\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Although the party was broadly united on the importance of health care as an issue facing the country, Black female Democrats in 2018 differed from other Democrats in their views of what to do about it.
 In particular, Black women were more likely than other Democrats to say the Affordable Care Act should be left as is, 29% to 19%, and less likely to say it should be expanded, 52% to 63%.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That difference may be an ideological one, but could also reflect a desire to support the signature policy of Obama, the nation’s first Black president.
 One clue that the latter might play a role: Black women in the Democratic primary this year were little different from other Democratic voters in views of specific health care policies.
 In the 2020 primaries, Black voters, including Black women, were about as likely as other voters to support a single payer health insurance plan.
 Among voters in the 2018 midterm elections, AP VoteCast shows that Black women were more likely than women in any other racial or ethnic group to support Democratic House candidates, and their support for Democrats was also somewhat higher than among Black men.

 Older voters helped propel him to the White House — the Pew Research Center estimates Trump led among voters 65 and older by 9 percentage points in 2016 — and his campaign hoped they would be a bulwark to cement a second term.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They remain a huge chunk of the electorate.
 Pew estimates that nationwide, nearly 1 in 4 eligible voters will be 65 and older.
 It’s the highest level on record, going back to 1970.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But there have been warnings that older voters are in play.
 They were particularly alarmed by Trump’s performances at daily task force briefings in the spring because his remarks showed an uneven handling of the crisis and inspired little confidence.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The president has tried to shore up his popularity with older adults.
 He has emphasized themes of law and order, and has warned that Democrats would preside over a sundering of the suburbs.
 He has promoted his prescription drug policy.
 And he has kept up steady visits to Florida — after Maine, the state with the oldest population — and advertised heavily there.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But whatever improvement he saw is now in jeopardy.
 The president’s own COVID-19 infection has refocused attention on the virus and his handling of it.
 If the 74-year-old Trump can’t safeguard his own health, some wonder, how can he be trusted to protect other older adults who are far more vulnerable?\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In few places could any significant drop-off spell doom more profoundly than Florida, a state Trump almost certainly must win.
 Older adults historically are the most reliable voters, and Florida is infamous for its tight races.
 “We’ve created the backdrop of possibilities for you to write the next chapter in your story,” its website says.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Retirees can enjoy everything from golf to seminars on Mark Twain to drinking a cold beverage in the town square while listening to a “jamgrass” band (progressive bluegrass in the vein of Phish).\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Politically, it long has been considered a conservative redoubt, so entrenched that it’s a must-stop for any national or statewide Republican running for office.
 During the 2008 presidential race, GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin drew a stadium-sized crowd with 60,000 residents flocking to see her in one of the community’s town squares.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Last fall, Trump picked The Villages to promote his support for Medicare and its private insurance option.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But on Wednesday, the scene told a markedly different story.
 There were.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But there was also “an overwhelming sense in 2016 of ‘we’ve got this in the bag.’ There was a level of complacency that she’d win,” said Stanley.
 “Now there’s a heightened sense of urgency, and in many ways, Trump has been our best recruiting tool ever.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;If the slow moving, four-wheel, golf cart show of force is an indication of growing allegiance to the Democrat among the retiree set, it would represent a substantial shift.
 In Florida, 29% of registered voters are 65 and older.
 “And it’s because of his demeanor, more than his policies.
 For older women, especially.
 They went through the battles.
 They frankly do not appreciate the demeaning of women.
 More than that, they’re thinking of their children and their grandchildren.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Indeed, at The Villages, many of the people riding in golf carts are women like Joan Morrill, a 76-year-old former Republican.
 The pandemic has weighed heavily on her, especially when she considers her four children and seven grandchildren.
 “We can’t live like this ...” she said.
 In recent weeks, Democrats have seized on this softening of support and have rolled out six ads targeting older voters.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In 2018, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press, older Republicans thought immigration was the nation’s most important issue, while older Democrats said health care was.
 But this year, with the pandemic, concern about health care has become a top issue for both.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Trump campaign seems to be paying attention.
 On Thursday, the president released a video of himself standing on the White House lawn in which he called older adults “my favorite people.” Noting that they are vulnerable to the virus, he asserted with no basis in fact that a medicine he said he was given in the hospital would be free to older people.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The seniors are going to be taken care of,” he said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That is not how it has played out so far.
 Not only has Florida been slammed by the virus, but also no other demographic has been affected more than older people.
 “We can’t go see our families because of COVID.
 I’m not seeing an end to it.
 There is no plan.
 Biden has a plan.
 He wears a mask.
 It gives us hope.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In recent weeks, Morrill watched as Trump announced he was infected with COVID-19, left the hospital days later and dramatically removed his mask upon his return to the White House.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She seethed.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I was angry,” she said, her voice shaking.
 “He’s showing a bad example.
 He thinks that nothing’s going to affect him.
 It feels like one lie after another.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;For the golf cart caravan, she wore a T-shirt that said “Team Fauci,” referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious-disease expert.
 “I trust the scientists and the doctors.
 Ron Hood, 78, a retired college biology professor, lives on the Atlantic coast in Jacksonville.
 Hood, a Democrat, is voting for Biden.
 He, too, feels that Trump has left older adults behind.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I do think there has been an attitude: ‘Well, it’s not that important to keep them alive and well.
 If we can’t, well, that’s too bad.
 Nice knowing you, bye,’” he said.
 “I just try not to dwell on things like that, though.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In rural Alachua County, which Clinton carried easily in 2016, 69-year-old Maxie Hicks is deeply troubled by the country’s direction and Trump’s leadership.
 “This is a Donald Trump funk.
 I’ve never seen this much hostility.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The retired state transportation department worker often thinks about how he and Trump are similar in age.
 “I don’t know how he could come through our generation and be so mean.
 So heartless.
 So insensitive.
 So indecent.
 So ungentlemanly.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The hostility that Hicks bemoans has played out even in “the friendliest town,” where Villagers who are Trump enthusiasts have held their own golf cart parades.
 On Wednesday, during the Biden rally, one woman in her golf cart decked out with Biden signs smiled and said good morning to a man coming from the other direction in a cart with a Trump sign.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Shove it!” he said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Judy Wise, a 75-year-old retiree in Plant City, a town east of Tampa on the Interstate 4 corridor, said her niece hasn’t spoken to her in years, since a fight over Trump.
 Wise is a stalwart supporter, and her niece is not.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s not so much about the man, but the ideology,” Wise explained.
 She’s convinced that Biden and the Democrats have a “plan to unseat capitalism” and that he will be a “puppet” of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, progressive Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Wise believes in small government and lower taxes, and she’s worried about the summer’s recent nationwide protests, a few of which have turned violent.
 Every few weeks, she waves Trump flags on the roadside of her Tampa suburb of Holiday with a group of other Republicans.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I love him.
 I think he’s doing a great job.
 He’s addressing the situations of everyday people’s normal everyday concerns,” she said.
 “He’s keeping his promises, with little to no help from the media or the Democrats.
 There is no positivity on anything he does.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As for the pandemic, she does think it’s serious for older people, but “it may be blown out of proportion.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I don’t believe the numbers they’re posting about deaths.
 I wash my hands.
 I wear my mask.
 I avoid getting very close to people I don’t know,” she said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Professor MacManus cautions that while some older voters have gravitated toward Biden, there are many others like Allen and Wise who are firmly in Trump’s corner.
 But that might not be enough for Trump.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“They’re still probably leaning more towards Trump.
 But in Florida, you look at margins,” she said.
 “He won the senior vote in Florida by double digits in 2016.
 And now we’re showing single digits in polls.

 State law dictates that a recount must be held if the margin between the two candidates is less than 0.5%.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Pennsylvania secretary of state’s website said Friday that there were about 89,000 more mail ballots to count.
 Many were from Allegheny County, a largely Democratic area that is home to Pittsburgh, and the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia County.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Additionally, there are potentially tens of thousands of provisional ballots that remain to be tabulated, though an exact number remained unclear.
 Those ballots will be counted after officials verify their eligibility to be included.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Pennsylvania is among a handful of battleground states Trump and Biden are narrowly contesting as they seek the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump, who held a 675,000-vote lead early Wednesday, prematurely declared victory in the state.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We’re winning Pennsylvania by a tremendous amount.
 We’re up 690,000 votes in Pennsylvania.
 These aren’t even close.
 It’s not like, ‘Oh, it’s close,’” Trump said during an appearance at the White House.
 It’s a form of voting that has skewed heavily in Biden’s favor after Trump spent months claiming — without proof — that voting by mail would lead to widespread voter fraud.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There's a possibility the race won't be decided for days.
 If there is less than a half percentage point difference between Biden and Trump's vote total, state law dictates that a recount must be held.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Democrats had long considered Pennsylvania a part of their “blue wall” — a trifecta that also includes Wisconsin and Michigan — that for years had served as a bulwark in presidential elections.
 He’s also campaigned extensively in the state from his home in Delaware.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;High turnout, a massive number of mail-in ballots and slim margins between the two candidates all contributed to the delay in naming a winner.
 But Biden held leads in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia, putting him in an ever-stronger position to capture the 270 Electoral College votes needed to take the White House.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There was intense focus on Pennsylvania, where Biden led Trump by more than 27,000 votes, and Nevada, where the Democrat led by about 22,000.
 The prolonged wait added to the anxiety of a nation facing historic challenges, including the surging pandemic and deep political polarization.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump stayed in the White House and out of sight, as more results trickled in and expanded Biden’s lead in must-win Pennsylvania.
 In the West Wing during the day, televisions remained tuned to the news amid trappings of normalcy, as reporters lined up for coronavirus tests and outdoor crews worked on the North Lawn on a mild, muggy fall day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden, for his part, addressed the nation Friday night near his home in Wilmington, Delaware, and acknowledged the sluggish pace of the count “can be numbing.” But he added, \"Never forget the tallies aren’t just numbers: They represent votes and voters.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He expressed confidence that victory ultimately would be his, saying, “The numbers tell us a clear and convincing story: We're going to win this race.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Standing alongside his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, and against a backdrop of flags, Biden wasn't able to give the acceptance speech his aides had hoped.
 But he hit notes of unity, seemingly aimed at cooling the temperature of a heated, divided nation.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We have to remember the purpose of our politics isn’t total unrelenting, unending warfare,\" he said.
 \"No, the purpose of our politics, the work of our nation, isn’t to fan the flames of conflict, but to solve problems, to guarantee justice, to give everybody a fair shot.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump's campaign on Friday was mostly quiet -- a dramatic difference from the day before, when officials held a morning call projecting confidence and then a flurry of press conferences announcing litigation in key states.
 But it was touched once again by the coronavirus pandemic.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Chief of staff Mark Meadows contracted the virus, according to two senior White House officials not authorized to publicly discuss private matters.
 Several other members of the White House staff and Trump’s campaign team also tested positive.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump's handling of the pandemic has been the defining issue of the campaign.
 The president, first lady Melania Trump and several other people in Trump's orbit have fallen ill. \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A handful of states remained in play Friday evening — Georgia, North Carolina too early to call along with Pennsylvania and Nevada.
 In all four states the margins between Trump and Biden were too narrow and the number of ballots left to be counted too great for the AP to declare a victor.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Pennsylvania, officials were not allowed to begin processing mail-in ballots until Election Day under state law.
 In Nevada, there were a number of provisional ballots cast by voters who registered on Election Day, and officials had to verify their eligibility.
 And recounts could be triggered in both Pennsylvania and Georgia.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;With his pathway to reelection appearing to greatly narrow, Trump was testing how far he could go in using the trappings of presidential power to undermine confidence in the vote.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Thursday, he advanced unsupported accusations of voter fraud to falsely argue that his rival was trying to seize power.
 It was an extraordinary effort by a sitting American president to sow doubt about the democratic process.
 I could make that claim also.
 Legal proceedings are just now beginning!\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump did claim that he won late on Election Night.
 He also tweeted that he had \"such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by,\" although it was well known that votes cast before Tuesday were still being legally counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden spent Thursday trying to ease tensions and project a more traditional image of presidential leadership.
 After participating in a coronavirus briefing, he declared that “each ballot must be counted.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I ask everyone to stay calm.
 The process is working,” Biden said.
 “It is the will of the voters.
 That was especially true for those who are eyeing presidential runs of their own in 2024.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Maryland GOP Gov.
 Larry Hogan, a potential presidential hopeful who has often criticized Trump, said unequivocally: “There is no defense for the President’s comments tonight undermining our Democratic process.
 America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But others who are rumored to be considering a White House run of their own in four years aligned themselves with the incumbent, including Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who tweeted support for Trump’s claims, writing that “If last 24 hours have made anything clear, it’s that we need new election integrity laws NOW.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s campaign engaged in a flurry of legal activity, saying it would seek a recount in Wisconsin and had filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Friday evening, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito approved a GOP request ordering county boards to comply with state guidance to keep the late ballots separate from those received before or on Election Day.
 However, Alito did not direct election officials to stop counting the ballots, as the Republicans had also sought.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But judges in three states quickly swatted down legal action.
 A federal judge who was asked to stop vote counts in Philadelphia instead forced the two sides to reach an agreement without an order over the number of observers allowed.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Really, can’t we be responsible adults here and reach an agreement?” an exasperated U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond said during an emergency hearing Thursday evening.
 The AP has declared Biden the winner in Arizona and said Thursday that it was monitoring the vote count as it proceeded.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The Associated Press continues to watch and analyze vote count results from Arizona as they come in,” said Sally Buzbee, AP’s executive editor.
 “We will follow the facts in all cases.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Weissert reported from Wilmington, Delaware.
 (AP) — Joe Biden's transition team isn't waiting for a verdict in the presidential race before getting to work.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As officials continue to count ballots in several undecided states, longtime Biden aide Ted Kaufman is leading efforts to ensure the former vice president can begin building out a government in anticipation of a victory.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“While we’re waiting for the final results, I want people to know we are not waiting to get the work done,” Biden said in a speech late Friday night, appearing with his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, at the convention center not far from his home in Wilmington, Delaware.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden noted that he and Harris had met virtually Thursday with public health and economic experts as they begin working to combat the coronavirus pandemic, saying it is becoming “significantly more worrisome all across the country.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Kaufman is a former senator from Delaware who was appointed to fill the seat vacated when Biden was elected vice president.
 He also worked on Barack Obama’s transition team in 2008, and helped write legislation formalizing the presidential transition process.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the meantime, an odd political limbo has taken told.
 The Biden can't tackle all that needs to be accomplished while President Donald Trump continues to claim without evidence that the election is being stolen from him.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s at least somewhat reminiscent of the 2000 presidential race and that year's post-election legal fight over the recount in Florida.
 After more than a month, the dispute between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore was decided by the Supreme Court — truncating the transition period to just 39 days before the January 2001 inauguration.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Clay Johnson, who headed Bush's transition team, said Biden’s advisers “can’t wait to be sure that the president-elect really is the president-elect.
 They have to hurry up and move forward.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Johnson said that in June of 1999 — about 17 months before Election Day 2000 — Bush approached him about heading the possible transition, having seen his father go through the process 11 years earlier.
 Prior to Election Day, Bush had already settled on Andy Card to serve as chief of staff for both the transition and at the White House.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Johnson thought they were ahead of schedule.
 But then came the recount.
 Instead, it used a former White House general counsel from the Reagan administration to conduct interviews designed to screen for potential problems that might have turned up in background checks.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"You have to assume you are it and not be presumptuous but they better be working hard as if they are it,” Johnson said of Biden’s team.
 “And they should have started doing that last Tuesday night.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden's campaign has refused to comment on the transition process.
 His closest advisers say the top priority will be announcing a White House chief of staff, then assembling the pieces needed to tackle the coronavirus.
 That could be a challenge for Biden since the Senate may well remain controlled by the Republicans.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The transition process formally starts once the General Service Administration determines the winner based on all available facts.
 That’s vague enough guidance that Trump could pressure the agency’s director to stall.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s also unclear if the president would meet personally Biden.
 President Barack Obama met with Trump less than a week after the election, but there was no dispute about him having topped Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Whenever the process starts, Biden will have to cope with the coronavirus, which has killed more than 230,000 Americans.
 Biden has promised to use his transition period to meet with the governors of every state and ask them to impose a nationwide mask-wearing mandate.
 He says he plans to go around any holdouts to secure such rules from county and local officials.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Another key decision will be how Biden decides to deploy his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris.
 His campaign has indicated that Biden will establish a White House-level coronavirus task force like Trump did, but it's not clear if he will tap Harris to run it.
 Vice President Mike Pence heads the current panel.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As his team awaits the results of the ballot counting, Biden is huddling in his Wilmington home with top advisers and family.
 Harris has stuck close too, occupying a Delaware hotel with her family since Election Night and joining Biden as he gave remarks in recent days.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a former Biden presidential primary rival, said he expects Harris to be “a real partner” to Biden and hopes to see her “managing major issues of importance.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Associated Press writer Kathleen Ronayne contributed to this report from Sacramento, Calf.

 It provides text-messaging services to GOP clients including the Republican National Committee.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“ALERT: Radical Liberals &amp; Dems are trying to steal this election from Trump!
 We need YOU!” the text said, directing recipients to “show your support” on a street corner near the Philadelphia Convention Center where votes were being counted and tensions were running high.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A top Trump campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the message did not come from the campaign.
 Because Opn Sesame is used by multiple customers, none of whom the company would identify, it could not be determined exactly who sent the message.
 Coby declined to comment.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Opn Sesame’s connection with the messages was first reported by The Washington Post.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Among those who received the rallying text was Chris Bray, who lives in rural Bucks County, about 25 miles outside Philadelphia.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A registered Independent who said he voted for Biden, Bray said he was very surprised to see the message pop up on his phone since he never signed up for anything related to the Trump campaign.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I actually texted a number of other friends to say ‘hey, have you guys been getting robo-texts like this?’\" Bray said Friday.

 The AP said Thursday it is monitoring the vote count in the state as ballots continued to be tallied.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The Associated Press continues to watch and analyze vote count results from Arizona as they come in,” said Sally Buzbee, AP’s executive editor.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The AP called the race in Arizona for Biden at 2:50 a.m. EST Wednesday after an analysis of ballots cast statewide concluded Trump could not catch up in the ballots left to be counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Arizona has a long political history of voting Republican.
 It’s the home state of Barry Goldwater, a five-term, conservative senator who was the Republican nominee for president in 1964.
 Those postmarked by Election Day can be counted if they arrive at election offices within seven days, which is Tuesday.
 More than 1.2 million ballots had been counted by Friday afternoon, with Joe Biden holding a 22,657-vote lead over President Donald Trump — an edge of about 1.8 points.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office said Friday night that statewide about 124,500 ballots remained to be processed, with 90% of them in Clark County.
 Just under half of those were mail ballots and the rest were provisional ballots cast by people who registered or updated their registration at the polls.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The vast majority of those untallied ballots are in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and its populous surrounding suburbs.
 Clark County Registrar Joe Gloria said on Friday that outstanding votes fell into several categories, each requiring multi-step verification to ensure the integrity of the election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE PROCESS\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Most still-to-be counted ballots arrived by mail, and are first processed through a machine that verifies signatures.
 Election staff manually examines signatures not verified by the machine.
 Later, a review is done to make sure the total number of ballots processed matches the number of ballots received.
 Once verified, those ballots are counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As of Thursday, an additional 44,000 ballots required ID verification, and 2,100 others had signature-match problems.
 The Legislature gave election officials until November 12 to finish counting votes, and Gloria said staff intended to work until then to resolve ballot issues.
 Along with counting mail ballots as they arrive, the county has about 5,100 provisional and same-day registration ballots that need to be counted.
 About 1,800 others have signature issues, which the agency is attempting to resolve with the voters.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Processing mail-in ballots takes longer, but “we haven’t had any hiccups, we haven’t had any delays,” said spokeswoman Bethany Drysdale.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;QUOTABLE:\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This is Nevada.

 Meanwhile, Democrat Joe Biden has gained some 73.9 million votes, versus the 65.9 that Hillary Clinton got.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;All in all, some 15 million more voters participated in this year’s presidential election than in the one four years ago.
 Nebraska and Iowa joined the ranks of states that send an absentee ballot application to every registered voter.
 New Jersey and California mailed ballots to every registered voter, whether they requested it or not.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Millions of voters took states up on the offer and chose to vote by mail rather than in person on election day.
 For some states, that has meant a slowdown in the tabulation of results because votes received by mail often take longer to process than ballots cast at polling places.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE EXPERIENCE FACTOR\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some states have done much better than others processing mail-in ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;States such as Florida and North Carolina learned from experience and allowed election officials to process mail ballots in the weeks leading up to election day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Florida, clerks can start counting ballots 22 days before an election.
 In North Carolina, beginning five weeks before the election, county boards insert approved ballots into a voting machine, allowing for a prompt tabulation on Election Day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But other states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all with Republican-led legislatures and all of them swing states, made a conscious decision to wait so there would be no counting of mail-in ballots prior to Election Day.
 Larry Hogan, a second-term Republican who has not ruled out a 2024 White House bid.
 “But to just make accusations of the election being stolen and widespread fraud without providing any evidence, I thought was really bad for our democratic process and it was something I had never seen in my lifetime.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Other Republicans did speak up,\" he noted, \"but certainly not enough of them.\" \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Indeed, the most aggressive Republican criticism was limited to the small and familiar group of frequent Trump critics such as Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who will not face Republican voters again for at least four years.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On the other side were Trump allies, including the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who called on Republicans considering running for the party's nomination in 2024 to come to the president's defense.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The total lack of action from virtually all of the ‘2024 GOP hopefuls’ is pretty amazing,\" he tweeted.
 “They have a perfect platform to show that they’re willing &amp; able to fight but they will cower to the media mob instead.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Several quickly raised their voices, including former South Carolina Gov.
 Nikki Haley, who served as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, though some Trump allies saw Haley's statement on Twitter thanking Trump for helping to deliver “conservative victories” up and down the ballot as reading too much like a political obituary of sorts for the president.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, another Trump ally in the 2024 conversation, avoided embracing some of Trump's most outlandish claims, but vowed to introduce new “election integrity” legislation to address some of the complaints Trump's campaign has raised.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In contrast, Missouri’s other Republican senator, Roy Blunt, was not afraid to call out Trump’s inconsistent calls to stop counting ballots in states where he’s ahead and keep counting in states where he’s behind.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“You can’t stop the count in one state and decide you want the count to continue in another state,\" Blunt told reporters.
 “That might be how you’d like to see the system work but that’s not how the system works.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As votes were tallied across the country Friday afternoon, Biden was on the cusp of winning the presidency as he opened up narrow leads in the critical battlegrounds of Georgia and Pennsylvania.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters Friday that he was “not conceding” Biden's tightening grasp on the presidency and fully supported Trump’s efforts to challenge ballot counts in several states.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Fox News the night before, Graham said he was transferring $500,000 from his campaign account to Trump’s legal fund, and called for others to make donations as well.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Ari Fleischer, a former aide to President George W. Bush, said Trump was simply saying out loud about the voting system what most losing candidates say privately.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I wish people talked with less bombast.
 But I’m not going to fault the president for it,” Fleischer said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Be gentle about Trump’s behavior,” he urged.
 “When I watched it last night and watched these heads explode I just rolled my eyes.
 ... We've always been a noisy democracy.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Yet history suggests that Trump's rhetoric and actions go well beyond the normal trappings of democracy.
 Never before has a sitting president so aggressively undermined the integrity of a U.S. election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;His strategy was entirely predictable.
 With polls showing him lagging, Trump raised questions about the integrity of the voting system for much of the year.
 Yet his words from the White House this week were no less shocking.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Even internally, some advisers did not want him to address the nation Thursday night when he made his most outrageous claims.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a staunch Trump ally, highlighted the obvious downside of Trump's questions about the integrity of the voting process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s very unfortunate that no matter who wins, the other half of America is not going to view this as a particularly legitimate election,” Johnson said on WTMJ-AM, a local radio station.
 \"I’m not saying it’s legitimate or not.
 I’m saying this process has been set up where people are not going to view it as legitimate.
 And that’s a real problem.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump spent most of Friday behind closed doors at the White House, angry about the direction of the race and insisting that his aides and allies push back.
 There was no indication he would concede, no matter what the final vote tally showed.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hogan, the Maryland governor, acknowledged that Trump would have “an important voice with the base of the Republican Party\" moving forward regardless of the 2020 election's outcome.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I’m sure he’s going to be a factor to contend with,\" Hogan said.
 “I don’t anticipate him going quietly.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Peoples reported from New York.
 AP writer Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, California, contributed to this report.
 But some GOP leaders struck a more neutral tone — and others urged the White House to fight.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Romney, now a senator from Utah, said Trump was within his rights to request recounts and call for investigations where evidence of irregularities exists.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But Trump “is wrong to say the election was rigged, corrupt and stolen,″ Romney said on Twitter.
 Trump’s claim “damages the cause of freedom here and around the world ... and recklessly inflames destructive and dangerous passions,” he said.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Romney is Trump’s most vocal critic within the Republican Party and voted to convict Trump in the president's impeachment trial earlier this year.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;His comments came as GOP Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania — whose state is a key battleground in the presidential election, where votes are still being tallied — called Trump's claim of fraud “very disturbing.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"There’s simply no evidence anyone has shown me of any widespread corruption or fraud,\" Toomey told \"CBS This Morning.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The president’s speech last night was very disturbing to me because he made very, very serious allegations without any evidence to support it,\" said Toomey.
 Trump did not back up his claims with any details or evidence, and state and federal officials have not reported any instances of widespread voter fraud.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell struck a more neutral tone, and other top Republicans more defiantly urged Trump to fight to defeat Democrat Joe Biden.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Every legal vote should be counted,” McConnell tweeted early Friday.
 “All sides must get to observe the process.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;McConnell grew testy during a press conference later in Kentucky when he was repeatedly asked to say more.
 “Beyond that, I don't have anything to say,” McConnell said.
 \"It won’t make any difference how many times you ask, I’ve already given my answer.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the GOP leadership, said Friday that Trump \"should turn this discussion over to his lawyers,'' adding that the Trump campaign was making inconsistent arguments.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“You can’t stop the count in one state and decide you want the count to continue in another state.
 That might be how you’d like to see the system work but that’s not how the system works,” Blunt said at the Capitol.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy took a more confrontational tone, insisting inaccurately that Trump “won” the election — even though officials in several states are still counting Americans' ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“So everyone who’s listening, do not be quiet, do not be silent about this.
 We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes,” McCarthy, R-Calif., said Thursday on Fox News.
 “Join together and let’s stop this.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The split showed the grip Trump still has on his party, particularly after Republicans in Congress won seats in the House and Senate running for reelection alongside the president.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;One top Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, told reporters Friday that he supports Trump’s efforts to challenge ballot counts in several states yet to be called in the presidential race.
 The South Carolina Republican said he had talked to the Trump campaign and expects evidence of voting irregularities to surface in the next 48 hours, but added that it was up to the Trump campaign to make that case.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;While he's “not conceding” that Biden is going to win the presidency, Graham said he will try to work with a potential Democratic administration.
 Graham, a conservative who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, vowed to “fight like hell'' to stop “a radical agenda,'' while recognizing that, “if Biden does win, he’s president,'' and Republicans will “try to work with him when we can.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Other GOP senators, governors and other elected officials swiftly pushed back against Trump.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Maryland GOP Gov.
 Larry Hogan, a potential 2024 presidential hopeful who has often criticized the president, said unequivocally: “There is no defense for the President’s comments tonight undermining our Democratic process.
 America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s tweets on Thursday declaring victory and calling for officials to “STOP THE COUNT” were a test of how strongly he can keep Republicans in line as he tries to challenge the voting process in court.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, urged “everyone to be patient'' as results come in.
 \"It is critical that we give election officials time to complete their jobs, and that we ensure all lawfully cast ballots are allowed and counted,'' she said in a statement.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rep. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican who did not seek reelection, called Trump's comments about corruption “dangerous” and “wrong.''
 Trump's remarks undermine the U.S. political process and “the very foundation this nation was built upon,'' Hurd said.
 While Democrat Joe Biden surpassed President Donald Trump early Friday, his lead is very narrow, and under Georgia law a candidate can request a recount if the margin is within 0.5 percentage points, which is the case here.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;We asked Kate Brumback, a reporter for The Associated Press in Atlanta, what could happen next.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;WHERE IS ALL THIS GOING?\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;With a margin this small, the secretary of state said this morning there will probably be a recount.
 Either candidate can make the request.
 The Trump campaign is trailing right now, and it seems like he would be likely to ask for one.
 Then they put those same ballots through the scanner and see if the tallies match.
 If they do, and the election workers determine the scanner is working accurately, every single ballot will then be rescanned.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;HOW MIGHT THIS END?\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Of course it's too soon to tell in this case.
 But the AP's research shows that there have been at least 31 statewide recounts since 2000.
 And of those, only three changed the outcome of the election.
 Some carried signs that read, “Make Elections Fair Again,” and “We Love Trump.” Police cordoned off streets leading to the tabulation center and maintained a close watch on the protest.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, speaking on CNN, said her main concern was staff safety but that sheriff's deputies were providing protection.
 Arizona law allows people to openly carry guns.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Authorities at the center used fences to create a “freedom of speech zone” and keep the entrance to the building open.
 The crowd took turns chanting — “Count the votes!\" and “Four more years!\" — and complaining through a megaphone about the voting process.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They paused to listen as Trump spoke from the White House, where he repeated many of his groundless assertions of a rigged vote.
 Several Atlanta police officers monitored the scene.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Tom Haas, 50, who said he was visiting Atlanta from Chicago on business, said he was convinced Trump had won the election.
 “There’s obvious voter fraud, and it’s coming out of the larger Democratic-run cities,” he said.
 \"We’re losing America because we’re losing a fair election for the nation.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Las Vegas, about 100 backers of the president chanted as they stood along the road in front of the election offices.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Meanwhile, Facebook banned a large group called “Stop the Steal” that Trump supporters were using to organize protests against the vote count.
 Some members had called for violence, while many falsely claimed Democrats are stealing the election.
 The group had amassed more than 350,000 members before Facebook took it down.
 It amounted to an extraordinary effort by a sitting American president to sow doubt about the democratic process.
 He repeatedly questioned the validity of mail-in ballots.
 And he demanded in advance that the results be known on Election Day, which is never a given\u003c/a&gt;.
 That’s a substantially different scenario than in the contested presidential election of 2000, which was effectively settled by the Supreme Court.
 Then, the entire fight was over Florida’s electoral votes and involved a recount as opposed to trying to halt the initial counting of ballots.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;WINNING LATINOS: Trump and his GOP allies made inroads with Latinos in the election that eroded Democratic strength among the nation’s second-largest demographic group.
 Not only did Trump win Florida partly from his support in heavily Cuban American Miami, but he also won some heavily Latino areas along the Texas border and helped the GOP keep an open congressional seat there.
 While the protests have not been violent or very large, local officials were exasperated and concerned by the relentless accusations.
 The outcome of contests in Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Nevada will determine whether Democrat Joe Biden or President Donald Trump wins.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The solidly Republican state of Alaska has also not been called because it is only 50% counted and will not release absentee numbers until Nov. 10.
 Under Georgia state law, a candidate can request a recount if the margin is within 0.5 percentage points.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The AP does not declare a winner of an election that will be — or is likely to become — subject to a mandatory recount.
 In instances where a recount isn't required by law but a candidate requests one, AP will not call a race if the margin between the top two candidates is 0.5 percentage points or less.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Electoral research conducted by the AP found there have been at least 31 statewide recounts since 2000.
 Three of those changed the outcome of the election.
 The initial margins in those races were 137 votes, 215 votes and 261 votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Among all 31 recounts, the largest shift in results was 0.1%, in the 2006 race for Vermont’s Auditor of Accounts.
 This was a low turnout election in which the initial results had one candidate winning by 137 votes.
 But even after about 87% of the estimated vote had been tallied, tens of thousands of votes remained to be counted statewide, which could eat into Biden’s advantage.
 Biden held a nearly 9 percentage point lead over Trump in the county on Friday.
 And elections officials there said they plan to continue counting 55,000 mail ballots there over the weekend.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Yet questions remain over just how much of the vote was left to count across the state, including these:\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;— Clark County officials said Thursday that they would be releasing the results of 51,000 ballots on Friday.
 But they later clarified that they had overestimated the size of the batch and released results from about 30,000 ballots instead.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;— Separately, state officials said Thursday that there were about 190,000 votes left to count statewide, a total that included mail ballots and provisional ballots from voters who registered or updated their registration at the polls.
 But it was unclear if that figure took into account the overestimated number of ballots by Clark County election officials.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In a tight race, that could delay the AP declaring a winner.
 For example, in the 2004 race between George W. Bush and John Kerry, the AP did not call the winner of the election in Ohio until it was able to confirm that Bush’s lead exceeded the number of provisional ballots left to be counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Nevada, once a swing state, has trended toward Democrats in the past decade.
 But this year there were signs that Trump could have an opening after narrowly losing the state in 2016.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Overall, Trump performed better than Mitt Romney did in 2012 or John McCain in 2008.
 The state also has has a higher percentage of non-college-educated whites, who have made up the base of his electoral support, than in many other pivotal states, including Florida, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Bush was the last Republican to win there, in 2004.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;NORTH CAROLINA: Race too early to call.
 Ballots left to count.
 They can’t catch us,” he said during an appearance at the White House.
 Trump also said he planned to contest the U.S. presidential election before the Supreme Court.
 It was unclear, exactly, what legal action he might pursue.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Though Trump is correct that he held a nearly 77,000-vote lead, which he maintained Thursday morning, the race is too early to call with up to 116,000 mail ballots left to count, as well as about 41,000 provisional ballots statewide.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As long as those ballots are postmarked by Nov. 3, state election officials have until Nov. 12 to count them.
 And when it comes to mail ballots, Biden was outperforming Trump.
 That means the ballots yet to be counted could give Biden a lead.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;PENNSYLVANIA: A close margin and a large number of outstanding votes are making the Pennsylvania contest too early to call.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE BACKGROUND: The Democrat held a lead over Trump of more than 19,500 votes at 7:30 p.m. EST Friday, out of more than 6.5 million ballots cast — a edge of about 0.29%.
 State law dictates that a recount must be held if the margin between the two candidates is less than 0.5%.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Pennsylvania secretary of state’s website said Friday that there were 102,541 more mail ballots to count.
 Many were from Allegheny County, a largely Democratic area that is home to Pittsburgh, and the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia County.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Additionally, there are potentially tens of thousands of provisional ballots that remain to be tabulated, though an exact number remained unclear.
 Those ballots will be counted after officials verify their eligibility to be included.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Elections officials are not allowed to process mail-in ballots until Election Day under state law.
 It’s a form of voting that has skewed heavily in Biden’s favor after Trump spent months claiming without proof that voting by mail would lead to widespread voter fraud.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Mail ballots from across the state overwhelmingly broke in Biden’s direction.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There’s also a possibility the race won’t be decided for days.
 If there is less than a half percentage point difference between Biden's and Trump’s vote totals, state law dictates that a recount must be held.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Democrats had long considered Pennsylvania a part of their “blue wall” — a trifecta that also includes Wisconsin and Michigan — that for years had served as a bulwark in presidential elections.
 In 2016, Trump won each by less than a percentage point.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden, who was born in Scranton, claims favorite-son status in the state and has long played up the idea that he was Pennsylvania’s “third senator” during his decades representing neighboring Delaware.
 He’s also campaigned extensively in the state from his home in Delaware.

 Democrats and Republicans prioritized different issues, lived in different communities and even voted on different kinds of ballots.
 Even the vote count itself threatens to further split Americans.
 “I just don’t see willing followers on either side.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The yawning divides will threaten the next president’s ability to manage multiple crises: Daily coronavirus infections set a record this week, the economy is struggling to recover from the pandemic and many Americans are pressing for a reckoning on racial injustices.
 Biden voters overwhelming say they want the federal government to prioritize limiting the spread of the virus, even if that means further damage to the economy.
 But most Trump voters preferred an approach that focused on the economy.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;About half of Trump voters also called the economy and jobs the top issue facing the nation, while only 1 in 10 Biden voters named it most important.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On race and justice issues, Biden voters almost universally said racism is a serious problem in U.S. society and in policing.
 But only a slim majority of Trump voters, who are overwhelming white, called racism a serious problem.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden has tried to bridge this gap, often appealing to a sense of national unity and the “soul” of America.
 Trump often casts himself as a defender of his voters.
 He has threatened to withhold pandemic-related aid from states run by Democratic governors and disparaged cities run by Democrats.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Many Democrats desperately hoped that Trump would suffer an embarrassing and broad defeat that would serve as a clear repudiation of Trump and his brand of politics.
 At the very least, they wanted an unambiguous mandate that would allow Biden to pursue ambitious policies on health care, education and the economy.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There's certainly not a clarion call to go in one direction or another.
 There’s a lot of confusion and chaos,\" said civil rights leader Martin Luther King III, who supported Biden.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The election solidified the parties' competing coalitions.
 Biden relied on urban and suburban voters, particularly women, college-educated voters and people of color.
 Trump exceeded his turnout numbers from 2016 by relying on thousands of new supporters from rural, GOP pockets of white voters across the country.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Results in high-turnout counties underscore that trend: Republican-leaning places became more Republican and Democratic areas more Democratic.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Democratic margin increased in 70% of the counties that went for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and the Republican margin widened in 56% of counties that Trump won that year, according to an Associated Press analysis of all counties that by Thursday evening had tallied more votes than in the last presidential election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That dynamic toppled some Democrats who had won seats in politically mixed areas by running as moderates.
 In Iowa, for example, Democrat Rep. Abby Finkenauer lost her reelection bid in the eastern part of the state as Trump bolstered his margins in rural areas such as Buchanan County just west of Dubuque.
 Trump won the rural county, which is 96% white, by 15 percentage points in 2016.
 That jumped to 21 percentage points this year.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That geographic polarization is part of what worries those who see the culture of cooperation in Washington rapidly eroding.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Former New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg, a leading Republican voice in the days after the Supreme Court decided the 2000 election, said it's unclear whether congressional leaders will have an incentive to work with the other party.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There were people in the Senate like Ted Kennedy and Ted Stevens who held strong views but were there first and foremost to get things done and govern, so they did not fear their base and were willing to compromise,” said Gregg, who has emerged as a Trump critic.
 “I am not sure that type of leadership is there today because of the strident voices that dominate both parties.
 But Biden, if president, has seen how it can be done, so we can hope.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Associated Press data journalist Angeliki Kastanis contributed to this report.

 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We did not win every battle but we did win the war,” Pelosi said.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rather than bolstering their majority, as planned, Democrats lost a handful of freshman lawmakers who had just won in a 2018 midterm election backlash against the president.
 They also failed to add to their ranks as Republicans defeated one Democratic challenger after another.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Asked what went wrong, one Democratic strategist granted anonymity to frankly run through the list shortcomings, said: “All of the above.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Money, with the onslaught of campaign cash flowing to Democrats in an anti-Trump revolt, was the one thing on their side.
 But money alone was not enough.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Key Democrats said the GOP attacks against them as wild-eyed “socialists” are damaging, as are some of the party's most liberal proposals.
 It gained prominence last summer after the police killing of Black people, including George Floyd, sparked a nationwide reckoning on racial injustice.
 Democrats also were criticized this year as insufficiently supporting Israel because of a liberal proposals helping Palestinians.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I think that the Democratic party needs to clearly push that we are not supportive of ideas like socialism or defunding the police or anti-Semitism,” said Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., a co-chair of the House's centrist Blue Dog Coalition.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Several Democrats said the “socialist” label particularly harmed lawmakers who lost seats in Florida with its vast Cuban and Venezuelan communities who largely reject socialist ideologies.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Murphy said the House leadership team was putting “lipstick on a pig” by touting the overall election outcome as a success.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"This playing footsies with socialism is not going to win over most of America,\" she said.
 “There’s no amount of lipstick that can cover up the fact that these far left ideas are costing us races.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But progressive ideas were also defended on the call, said another person granted anonymity to discuss it.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Other Democrats argued it was always going to be difficult to defend the House majority.
 It was won in 2018 with more women and minority candidates in history, reaching into districts Trump had won in 2016.
 Holding onto those seats would be tougher once the president was back on the ballot.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In defeating Democrats, Republicans filled many of the seats with more women and minority candidates than ever, after their ranks of both had dwindled to single digit numbers in the House.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Democratic freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who won re-election in Michigan, did so with a more narrow margin than she did in 2018.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“With President Trump on the ballot, it just drove enormous turnout that was almost impossible to surmount” in some areas, she said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Other lawmakers in Oklahoma, New Mexico and South Carolina did not fare as well, and were defeated.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the brash former hockey player, delighted after the GOP wins in reminding people that Democrats laughed when he first rolled out the Republican plan for the election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Our message from day one was that the Democrats' radical socialist agenda is a threat to middle-class Americans,” he said on Wednesday conference call with reporters.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Democrats, he said, \"should have listened.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Polling was clearly a problem, on all sides, strategists said.
 Republicans, too, thought they were heading toward losses but instead made gains.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But they also need to learn how to win back the Trump voters they have lost.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Is there something that we’re missing about these Trump voters?
 said Rep. Ami Bera, D-Ca., a member of the centrist House New Democrat Coalition.
 “I’m proud of how transparent and secure our process has been.
 I know that the truth is on our side here.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Poll watchers have been a central element of legal battles that have erupted in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada.
 Monitors are not allowed to interfere with the conduct of the election and are typically required to register in advance with the local election office.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Nevada's most populous county, officials said poll watchers were allowed in designated areas, told to comply with social distancing and mask requirements and required to be escorted by county representatives.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“When they sign in, they have to agree to follow the rules that are guided by statute.
 If they don’t follow the rules ... they will be removed from the location,” said Joe Gloria, the chief elections official in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Trump campaign had sought to halt the counting of mail ballots in the county, saying observers were being kept too far away to be able to see if signatures matched voter registration records.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Pennsylvania, disputes over poll watchers were concentrated largely in Philadelphia, where the Trump campaign complained its observers could not get close enough to see whether mail-in ballot envelopes had signatures along with eligible voters' names and addresses.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Ballots without this information could be challenged or disqualified, but city officials said state election law allows poll watchers only to observe the work and not audit it.
 “Some jurisdictions including Philly are also livestreaming, so you can literally watch their counting process from anywhere in the world.
 It's very transparent.\" \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Thursday, a state judge ordered Philadelphia officials to allow party and candidate observers to move closer to election workers processing mail-in ballots.
 A spokesperson for the Philadelphia board of elections said barriers were shifted in response to the order while the city appealed it.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Later, a federal court in Philadelphia denied a Trump campaign bid to stop the vote count over the access issues, urging the two sides to forge an agreement.
 U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond suggested each party be allowed 60 observers inside the convention center where ballots were being tallied.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Voting advocates noted the restrictions applied to both Republican and Democratic poll watchers.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There are specific rules in Pennsylvania about where poll watchers can stand and what they can do,” said Suzanne Almeida, interim director of Common Cause Pennsylvania.
 “It applies to both parties equally.
 Everyone has the exact same access.
 Some smaller offices might allow only a few inside, while larger ones could have dozens.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Also Thursday, a Michigan judge dismissed a Trump campaign lawsuit over whether enough Republican poll watchers had access to the handling of absentee ballots.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Much of the dispute centered on Detroit, where absentee ballots were counted at a downtown convention center.
 Some 134 counting boards were set up, and each party was allowed one poll watcher per board, according to City Clerk Janice Winfrey.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She said she was not aware of any Republican poll watchers being removed but noted some had been “very aggressive, trying to intimidate the poll workers and processors.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Ray Wert, who volunteered as a Democratic poll watcher at the site, said he found a group of Republican supporters blocking the entrance and he observed police officers telling the crowd that no additional people were being let inside because there were equal numbers of partisan poll watchers.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“My concerns are that this is going to be used to delegitimize what is a very clear and very well-run process for counting these ballots,” Wert said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Cassidy reported from Atlanta, and Izaguirre reported from Lindenhurst, New York.
 The outcome of contests in Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Nevada will determine whether Democrat Joe Biden, or President Donald Trump wins.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The solidly Republican state of Alaska has also not been called because it is only 50% counted and will not release absentee numbers until Nov. 10.
 It is not expected to impact the outcome.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Associated Press reviews the states that will determine the presidency:\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;GEORGIA: Outstanding ballots left to be counted in counties where Biden has performed well.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE BACKGROUND: Early Wednesday, Trump prematurely claimed he carried Georgia.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“It’s ... clear that we have won Georgia.
 We’re up by 2.5%, or 117,000 (votes) with only 7% (of the vote) left” to count, Trump said during an early morning appearance at the White House.
 He also said he planned to contest the U.S. presidential election before the Supreme Court.
 With an estimated 99% of the vote counted there, Trump's lead over Biden had shrunk to less than 2,000 votes Thursday evening, with tens of thousands more ballots left to be counted.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That includes mailed ballots from population-dense counties in the Atlanta metro region that lean Democratic.
 Biden is overperforming Hillary Clinton’s 2016 showing in those counties, including in their more upscale suburban reaches.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;NEVADA: Race too early to call; vote count will continue for several more days.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE BACKGROUND: Democrat Joe Biden leads by less than 1 percentage point in Nevada over President Donald Trump, with more than 1.2 million ballots counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That’s after election officials in Nevada released updated returns on Thursday, including a batch of 14,285 and 12,189 ballots, respectively, in the state’s two largest counties, Clark and Washoe.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Overall, officials have tallied a little more than three-quarters of the state’s expected vote.
 Under state law, ballots postmarked by Election Day will still be counted if they arrive by Tuesday, Nov. 10.
 Clark County said Thursday it did not expect to complete counting the bulk of its mail votes until this weekend.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Among the ballots still left to be processed in Nevada this year are provisional ballots, including 60,000 in Clark County, where most of the state’s voters live.
 Those ballots were mostly cast by voters who registered on Election Day and will be counted after officials verify their eligibility to be included.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In a tight race, that could delay the AP declaring a winner.
 For example, in the 2004 race between George W. Bush and John Kerry, the AP did not call the winner of the election in Ohio until it was able to confirm that Bush’s lead exceeded the number of provisional ballots left to be counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Nevada, once a swing state, has trended toward Democrats in the past decade.
 Trump narrowly lost Nevada in 2016.
 Bush was the last Republican to win there, in 2004.
 Ballots left to count.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE BACKGROUND: Trump prematurely claimed early Wednesday that he won the state.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We’ve clearly won North Carolina, where we’re up 1.7%, 77,000 votes with only approximately 5% left.
 They can’t catch us,” he said during an appearance at the White House.
 Trump also said he planned to contest the U.S. presidential election before the Supreme Court.
 It was unclear, exactly, what legal action he might pursue.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Though Trump is correct that he held a nearly 77,000-vote lead, which he maintained Thursday morning, the race is too early to call with up to 116,000 mail ballots left to count, as well as about 41,000 provisional ballots statewide.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As long as those ballots are postmarked by Nov. 3, state election officials have until Nov. 12 to count them.
 And when it comes to mail ballots, Biden was outperforming Trump.
 That means the ballots yet to be counted could give Biden a lead.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE BACKGROUND: Pennsylvania is among a handful of battleground states Trump and Biden are narrowly contesting, and there were hundreds of thousands of votes left to be counted Thursday morning.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump, who held a 675,000-vote lead early Wednesday, prematurely declared victory in the state.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We’re winning Pennsylvania by a tremendous amount.
 We’re up 690,000 votes in Pennsylvania.
 These aren’t even close.
 It’s not like, ‘Oh, it’s close,’” Trump said during an appearance at the White House.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;By late Thursday his lead had slipped to about 24,000 votes — and the race is expected to get tighter.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;One reason is because elections officials are not allowed to process mail-in ballots until Election Day under state law.
 It’s a form of voting that has skewed heavily in Biden’s favor after Trump spent months claiming without proof that voting by mail would lead to widespread voter fraud.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Mail ballots from across the state overwhelmingly broke in Biden’s direction.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There’s also a possibility the race won’t be decided for days.
 If there is less than a half percentage point difference between Biden and Trump’s vote total, state law dictates that a recount must be held.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Democrats had long considered Pennsylvania a part of their “blue wall” — a trifecta that also includes Wisconsin and Michigan — that for years had served as a bulwark in presidential elections.
 In 2016, Trump won each by less than a percentage point.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden, who was born in Scranton, claims favorite-son status in the state and has long played up the idea that he was Pennsylvania’s “third senator” during his decades representing neighboring Delaware.
 He’s also campaigned extensively in the state from his home in Delaware.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;When he at last emerged, it was to stand behind the presidential seal in the White House and deliver a diatribe most notable for his litany of false statements about the election and his attempt to cast doubt on the integrity of the democratic process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As votes continued to be counted and Democrat Joe Biden edged closer to victory, Trump lashed out Thursday evening in a performance that suggested he knew his prospects for a second term were slipping away.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“If you count the legal votes, I easily win.
 If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,\" Trump claimed.
 In fact, there is no evidence that any votes cast illegally are being counted or that the process is unfair and corrupt.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump delivered his statement before reporters in the White House briefing room and left without taking questions.
 It came after Trump and his allies spent a second day watching and waiting with the rest of the nation as vote totals pushed further in Biden’s direction in some key battlegrounds.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;With just a handful of states yet to be decided, Biden had a clear advantage over Trump, but the president still retained a narrow path to the 270 electoral votes needed to win reelection.
 Trump's voters were far more likely to vote in-person after the president spent months casting aspersions on mail-in voting.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Before Thursday evening, Trump had not been seen in public since his unfounded declaration of victory in the wee hours of Wednesday morning.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Since then, the mood in the White House has shifted dramatically.
 Some aides in the West Wing have wearily eyed returns, losing confidence that outstanding states would break Trump’s way.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump spent the last two days monitoring the results and calling allies, including Texas Gov.
 Greg Abbott and Arizona Gov.
 Doug Ducey.
 But the president has no authority over vote counting, and halting the count at that moment would have resulted in a swift victory for Biden.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“ANY VOTE THAT CAME IN AFTER ELECTION DAY WILL NOT BE COUNTED!” he later wrote.
 That seemed to advocate tossing out untold legally cast votes, including those from service members stationed overseas.
 Many states accept mail-in ballots after Election Day as long as they were postmarked by Nov. 3.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump's all-caps declarations had the tone of a last stand from a man who abhors losing.
 They mirrored a last-ditch legal effort waged by his campaign in several key undecided battlegrounds that was largely dismissed by experts as superficial and unlikely to shift the outcome in any meaningful way.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Still, Trump's team outwardly expressed optimism.
 He predicted Trump would win Pennsylvania and other states that were too early to call.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Behind the scenes, however, the mood was more somber, with White House and campaign staff glued to television screens and watching results trickle in.
 Some in the West Wing were all but resigned to the idea of a Trump loss and have been discussing future employment prospects even as others continue to make unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter fraud.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Many White House and senior Republican officials were in the dark about what Trump planned to say in his evening speech.
 And privately, some expressed consternation that Trump was publicly undermining faith in the democratic process.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden himself responded: “No one is going to take our democracy away from us.
 Not now, not ever.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;After delivering his statement, the president stopped for a few minutes in the White House press office behind the briefing room and appeared to be watching his coverage live on television.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump had no other public events Thursday.
 And he made no reference to the surging coronavirus pandemic as confirmed new positive cases climbed to an all-time high.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden received a private briefing on the virus Thursday afternoon before emerging to tell the American public to be patient in awaiting the election results.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump's campaign was dispatching loyalists like former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former director of national intelligence Ric Grenell to hold press conferences in states where they are mounting legal challenges.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The campaign also bombarded supporters with fundraising messages warning of unsubstantiated Democratic efforts to “steal” the outcome.
 The effort had raised well over $10 million, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because of not being authorized to discuss it publicly.
 At least some of the money was earmarked for paying down general election debt.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Allies of the president, including his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., used Twitter to call out what the younger Trump labeled, “The total lack of action from virtually all of the ‘2024 GOP hopefuls.’\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“They have a perfect platform to show that they’re willing &amp; able to fight but they will cower to the media mob instead,” he wrote.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump Jr., who has also been discussed as a potential future candidate, made clear the family has no interest in calmly waiting for votes to be counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The best thing for America’s future is for @realDonaldTrump to go to total war over this election to expose all of the fraud, cheating, dead/no longer in state voters, that has been going on for far too long,” he wrote.
 Trump did not back up his claims with any details or evidence, and state and federal officials have not reported any instances of widespread voter fraud.
 Larry Hogan, a potential 2024 presidential hopeful who has often criticized Trump, said unequivocally: “There is no defense for the President’s comments tonight undermining our Democratic process.
 America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“No election or person is more important than our Democracy,” Hogan said on Twitter.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Other criticism, though less direct, came from members of Congress.
 Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who spoke at a recent Trump campaign rally, said in a tweet that if any candidate believes “a state is violating election laws they have a right to challenge it in court &amp; produce evidence in support of their claims.
 ''\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rubio said earlier: “Taking days to count legally cast votes is NOT fraud.
 And court challenges to votes cast after the legal voting deadline is NOT suppression.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah., the party's presidential nominee in 2012, sought to provide a reassuring note.
 Counting votes is often “long” and “frustrating,” Romney said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;If any irregularities are alleged, “they will be investigated and ultimately resolved in the courts,″ Romney tweeted.
 “Have faith in democracy, our Constitution and the American people.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The comments by the Republican lawmakers and other GOP leaders were rare, public rebukes of Trump, who has demanded — and generally received — loyalty from fellow Republicans throughout his four-year term.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Before Trump's speech in the White House briefing room, several Republicans challenged his attempts to halt vote-counting in Pennsylvania and other battleground states.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Trump ally who won reelection Tuesday in Kentucky, told reporters that “claiming you’ve won the election is different from finishing the counting.” His office declined to comment after Trump's address Thursday.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, urged “everyone to be patient'' as results come in.
 \"It is critical that we give election officials time to complete their jobs, and that we ensure all lawfully cast ballots are allowed and counted,'' she said in a statement.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rep. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican who did not seek reelection, called Trump's comments about corruption “dangerous” and “wrong.''
 Trump's remarks undermine the U.S. political process and “the very foundation this nation was built upon,'' Hurd said.
 \"Every American should have his or her vote counted.
 ''\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;While Biden was close Thursday to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House, it was unclear when a national winner would be determined after a long, bitter campaign dominated by the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on Americans and the national economy.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told The Associated Press earlier Thursday he hopes Republicans step up their response to Trump's unsubstantiated claims.
 While Republicans may want to give Trump time to \"make his arguments,\" when it becomes clear that claims are without basis, “My hope is that Republicans will put public and private pressure on him,” Murphy said.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But one of Trump’s top congressional supporters said he supports efforts to question the vote counting process and is donating money to shore up legal challenges.
 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Fox News Thursday night he would donate $500,000 to the president’s “legal defense fund” and urged people to go to the Trump campaign’s website to pitch in.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rep. Denver Riggleman, a Virginia Republican who lost a GOP primary this year, addressed Trump directly on Twitter: “Count every vote, yes, but stop the Bravo Sierra, Mr. President, and respect the democratic process that makes America great.” Riggleman, a former Air Force officer, was using a military euphemism for falsehoods.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In remarks Wednesday at the White House, Trump baselessly claimed victory and alleged “major fraud on our nation” as state election officials continued counting ballots amid a huge increase in voter turnout.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Former New Jersey Gov.
 Chris Christie, a Trump ally who is an analyst for ABC News, said there was no basis for Trump's argument.
 Christie called Trump's attack on the integrity of the election “a bad strategic decision” and \"a bad political decision, and it’s not the kind of decision you would expect someone to make ... who holds the position he holds.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump's family, never shy about expressing their support, took to Twitter to question why GOP lawmakers were not rushing to the president's defense.
 “Where are Republicans!
 Have some backbone.
 Fight against this fraud.
 Our voters will never forget you if your sheep!” Trump's son Eric tweeted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Some GOP governors responded.
 Florida Gov.
 Ron DeSantis urged the president to “Fight on, exhaust all options.\" South Dakota Gov.
 Kristi Noem tweeted that Trump was fighting “rigged election systems.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Sen.
 Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said states administer U.S. elections, not the federal government.
 \"We should respect that process and ensure that all ballots cast in accordance with state laws are counted.
 In fact, the ballot-counting process across the country has been running smoothly for the most part, even with the U.S. in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;One of his main complaints, that counting spilled over past Election Day, is meritless.
 No presidential election has had all the votes counted the same day, and there is no law or even expectation that that should be the case.
 The surge in mailed ballots and the high turnout have made the process slower than usual in some, but not all, cases.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;PENNSYLVANIA\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “In Pennsylvania partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election and we think much more than that and they are counting those without any postmarks or any identification whatsoever.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: “Partisan Democrats” didn't ordain this.
 It was the state Supreme Court that ruled ballots mailed before the end of Election Day could be received up to three days later and still be counted.
 The U.S. Supreme Court examined the case and did not stand in the way of the three-day timeframe.
 It may review the matter again later.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A number of other states have also made accommodations for the crush of mailed ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “Pennsylvania Democrats have gone to the state Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers.
 ...
 They don’t want anybody in there.
 They don’t want anybody watching them while they are counting the ballots.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: That’s false.
 He is wholly misrepresenting a court case in the state.
 No one tried to ban poll watchers representing each side in the election.
 The Trump campaign sued to allow the observers to get closer than the guidelines had allowed.
 A court ruled in favor of that request.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;MICHIGAN\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: That’s false.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Absentee ballots were counted at a downtown convention center, where some 134 counting boards were set up.
 Each party was allowed one poll watcher per board, said City Clerk Janice Winfrey.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She said she was not aware of any Republican poll watchers being removed but noted some had been “very aggressive, trying to intimidate the poll workers and processors.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Mark Brewer, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said he was inside the convention center and access was cut off to some people from both sides at one point because of capacity restrictions related to the pandemic.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;GEORGIA\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: No, the state’s elections are overseen by a Republican, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “The 11th Circuit ruled that in Georgia the votes have to be in by Election Day, that they should be in by Election Day.
 And they weren’t.
 Votes are coming in after Election Day.” \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: That’s not an accurate description of the ruling in question or what happened in the election in Georgia.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Although the court ruled that votes must be in by 7 p.m. Election Day for them to count, an exception was made for ballots from the members of U.S. Military serving overseas.
 Those can be received until 5 p.m. Friday and still count.
 Election officials in Georgia are still counting votes, but they are votes that have been lawfully received.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;‘ILLEGAL’ VOTES\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP: “If you count the legal votes, I easily win.
 if you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: This is baseless.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Neither Trump’s campaign aides nor election officials have identified substantial numbers of “illegal” votes, much less the mammoth numbers it would take to ruin an easy win by Trump.
 He frequently speaks as if mail-in voting itself is illegitimate.
 But it unfolded in accordance with state voting rules, in some cases adapted by officials to help voters get through the pandemic safely.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;TRUMP, complaining that underhanded activity sapped his leads in important races: “We were winning all the key locations, by a lot actually.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;THE FACTS: The change in fortunes he speaks about is explained by the nature of vote counting in the states, not by any sudden surge of malfeasance that others have not seen.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Often, big cities are slower to report their numbers, and those votes tend skew Democratic.
 Likewise, many states tend to count mail-in ballots at the end of the process.
 That portion of the vote has tended to favor Biden, particularly because Trump urged his supporters in advance to avoid mail-in voting and to vote in person either early or on Election Day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump finished election night with leads in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, among the states most in play, then saw his advantage begin to fray Wednesday and past that.
 Biden won Wisconsin and Michigan; Georgia and Pennsylvania can’t yet be called.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Dale reported from Philadelphia.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“We did not win every battle but we did win the war,” Pelosi said.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But there were plenty of complaints to go around — over faulty polling, Republican attack ads — as expectations had been raised sky high for election night gains and that made the setbacks all the more disorienting.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rather than bolstering their majority, as planned, Democrats lost a handful of freshman lawmakers who had just won in a 2018 midterm election backlash against the president.
 But money alone was not enough.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Key Democrats said the GOP attacks against them as wild-eyed “socialists” are damaging, as are some of the party's most liberal proposals.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They cited the “defund the police” movement that calls for shifting law enforcement resources to social workers and other ways of revolving conflicts.
 It gained prominence last summer after the police killing of Black people, including George Floyd, sparked a nationwide reckoning on racial injustice.
 Democrats also were criticized this year as insufficiently supporting Israel because of a liberal proposals helping Palestinians.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I think that the Democratic party needs to clearly push that we are not supportive of ideas like socialism or defunding the police or anti-Semitism,” said Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., a co-chair of the House's centrist Blue Dog Coalition.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Several Democrats said the “socialist” label particularly harmed lawmakers who lost seats in Florida with its vast Cuban and Venezuelan communities who largely reject socialist ideologies.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Murphy said the House leadership team was putting “lipstick on a pig” by touting the overall election outcome as a success.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"This playing footsies with socialism is not going to win over most of America,\" she said.
 “There’s no amount of lipstick that can cover up the fact that these far left ideas are costing us races.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But progressive ideas were also defended on the call, said another person granted anonymity to discuss it.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Other Democrats argued it was always going to be difficult to defend the House majority.
 It was won in 2018 with more women and minority candidates in history, reaching into districts Trump had won in 2016.
 Holding onto those seats would be tougher once the president was back on the ballot.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In defeating Democrats, Republicans filled many of the seats with more women and minority candidates than ever, after their ranks of both had dwindled to single digit numbers in the House.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Democratic freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who won re-election in Michigan, did so with a more narrow margin than she did in 2018.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“With President Trump on the ballot, it just drove enormous turnout that was almost impossible to surmount” in some areas, she said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Other lawmakers in Oklahoma, New Mexico and South Carolina did not fare as well, and were defeated.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the brash former hockey player, delighted after the GOP wins in reminding people that Democrats laughed when he first rolled out the Republican plan for the election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Our message from day one was that the Democrats' radical socialist agenda is a threat to middle-class Americans,” he said on Wednesday conference call with reporters.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Democrats, he said, \"should have listened.\"\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Polling was clearly a problem, on all sides, strategists said.
 Republicans, too, thought they were heading toward losses but instead made gains.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But they also need to learn how to win back the Trump voters they have lost.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Is there something that we’re missing about these Trump voters?
 said Rep. Ami Bera, D-Ca., a member of the centrist House New Democrat Coalition.
 But in places where the virus is most rampant now, Trump enjoyed enormous support.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;An Associated Press analysis reveals that in 376 counties with the highest number of new cases per capita, the overwhelming majority — 93% of those counties — went for Trump, a rate above other less severely hit areas.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Most were rural counties in Montana, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Wisconsin — the kinds of areas that often have lower rates of adherence to social distancing, mask-wearing and other public health measures, and have been a focal point for much of the latest surge in cases.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Taking note of the contrast, state health officials are pausing for a moment of introspection.
 The tally for new cases Thursday was on track for another day above 100,000, with massive numbers reported all around the country, including a combined nearly 25,000 in Texas, Illinois and Florida.
 Iowa and Indiana each reported more than 4,000 cases as well.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The AP’s analysis was limited to counties in which at least 95% of precincts had reported results, and grouped counties into six categories based on the rates of COVID-19 cases they’d experienced per 100,000 residents.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Polling, too, shows voters who split on Republican Trump vs. Democrat Joe Biden differed on whether the pandemic is under control.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Thirty-six percent of Trump voters described the pandemic as completely or mostly under control, and another 47% said it was somewhat under control, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 110,000 voters conducted for the AP by NORC at the University of Chicago.
 Meanwhile, 82% of Biden voters said the pandemic is not at all under control.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The pandemic was considered at least somewhat under control by slim majorities of voters in many red states, including Alabama (60%), Missouri (54%), Mississippi (58%), Kentucky (55%), Texas (55%), Tennessee (56%) and South Carolina (56%).\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Wisconsin, where the virus surged just before the election, 57% said the pandemic was not under control.
 In Washington state, where the virus is more in control now compared to earlier in the year, 55% said the same.
 Voters in New York and New Hampshire, where the virus is more controlled now after early surges, were roughly divided in their assessments, similar to voters nationwide.
 She cast her vote for Trump.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I feel like the most important issue facing the country as a whole is liberty at large,” Lane said.
 “Infringing on people’s freedom, government overrule, government overreach, chaos in a lot of issues currently going on and just giving people back their rights.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;About half of Trump voters called the economy and jobs the top issue facing the nation, roughly twice the percentage who named the pandemic, according to VoteCast.
 By contrast, a majority of Biden voters — about 6 in 10 — said the pandemic was the most important issue.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Madison, Wisconsin, Eric Engstrom, a 31-year-old investment analyst and his wife, Gwen, voted absentee by mail in early October.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s failure to control the pandemic sealed his vote for Biden, Engstrom said, calling the coronavirus the most immediate threat the nation faces.
 He and his wife are expecting their first child, a girl, in January and fear “the potential of one of us or both of us being sick when the baby is born,” he said.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Engstrom called Trump's response to the virus abysmal.
 When I say ‘we’ I mean collectively,” Sgaier said.
 Finding common ground may become easier if one of more of the vaccine candidates proves safe and effective and gains government approval, she said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“The vaccine provides the reset button,” Sgaier said.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Dr. Anthony Fauci may be another unifying force.
 According to VoteCast, 73% of voters nationwide approve of the way Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been handling the pandemic.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Even among Trump voters, 53% approve of Fauci's performance.
 About 9 in 10 Biden voters approve.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Johnson reported from Washington state.

 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Hours earlier, Biden offered reassurances that the counting could be trusted, projecting a more presidential appearance while urging patience from Americans.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The candidates' sharply contrasting postures intensified a national moment of uncertainty as the nation and the world waited to learn which man would collect the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency.
 Trump pursued legal options with little success, working the phones and escalating efforts to sow doubt about the outcome of the race.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;His path to victory narrow, Trump pushed unsupported allegations of electoral misconduct in a series of tweets and insisted the ongoing vote count of ballots submitted before and on Election Day must cease.
 And in his first public appearance since late on Election Night, he amplified the conspiracy theories amid the trappings of presidential power.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This is a case when they are trying to steal an election, they are trying to rig an election,” said Trump of Democrats, whom he accused of corruption while providing no evidence.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He made similar claims about election integrity during the 2016 campaign, which he went on to win.
 This time, he was speaking not as a candidate, but as the sitting president of the United States.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden took a different tack, speaking briefly to reporters after attending a COVID-19 briefing to declare that “each ballot must be counted.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“I ask everyone to stay calm.
 The process is working,” said Biden.
 “It is the will of the voters.
 It could take several more days for the vote count to conclude and a clear winner emerge.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;With millions of ballots yet to be tabulated, Biden already had received more than 72 million votes, the most in history.
 Statewide recounts in Wisconsin have historically changed the vote tally by only a few hundred votes; Biden led by more than 20,000 ballots out of nearly 3.3 million counted.
 The contests in Georgia and Pennsylvania, along with Nevada and North Carolina, were tight with votes still being tabulated.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Trump campaign said it was confident the president would ultimately pull out a victory in Arizona, where votes were also still being counted, including in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous area.
 “We will follow the facts in all cases.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump's legal challenges faced long odds.
 He would have to win multiple suits in multiple states in order to stop vote counts, since more than one state was undeclared.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There were no obvious grounds for the Justice Department to attempt to intervene to stop a vote count at the state level, unless the federal government could somehow assert a violation of federal voting laws or the Constitution.
 The department could theoretically file a brief in support of a Trump campaign lawsuit if it believed there were federal concerns at stake, but that intervention would be extraordinary.
 Counting for votes received by Nov. 3 was continuing, but roughly 20 states allow ballots to be counted if postmarked by Nov. 3 but received in the days after.
 In some states that is as long as nine days, or even longer.
 Some of the deadline changes were made as a result of the pandemic, but others are just routine parts of state election laws.
 Trump has fixated on Pennsylvania, where the Supreme Court refused to stop a court’s ruling that allowed for a three-day extension.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He also said he was taking fraud claims to court – but most of the lawsuits only demand better access for campaign observers to locations where ballots are being processed and counted.
 A judge in Georgia dismissed the campaign’s suit there less than 12 hours after it was filed.
 The U.S. on Wednesday set another record for daily confirmed cases as several states posted all-time highs.

 He did not back up his claim with any details or evidence.
 State and federal officials have not reported any instances of widespread voter fraud.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump spoke from the White House briefing room on Thursday, unleashing harsh criticism of pre-election polling that showed him trailing Democrat Joe Biden and claiming without evidence that the ballot-counting process is unfair and corrupt.
 He also renewed his criticism of widespread use of mail-in balloting in the pandemic.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The ballot-counting process across the country has been running smoothly, and the count is ongoing in several battleground states.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;6:15 p.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A legal effort in Nevada by President Donald Trump’s campaign and state Republicans to try to stop the count of mail ballots in Las Vegas is over.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A document submitted in an appeal pending before the state Supreme Court says the campaign, state GOP, Democrats and attorneys for the state have reached a settlement requiring Clark County election officials to supply “additional observation access” at a ballot processing facility in Las Vegas.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The state high court declined on Election Day to stop the count based on an appeal of a state judge’s decision not to stop processing mail ballots in Las Vegas and surrounding Clark County -- a Democratic stronghold in an otherwise red GOP state.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In an order released Monday, Judge James Wilson Jr. in Carson City said he found neither the state nor Clark County had done anything to give one vote preference over another.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Nevada Democrats accuse Republicans of trying to suppress voting in the state’s most diverse area.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump campaign representatives said Thursday that they intended to file another complaint in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas to try to stop the counting of what state campaign co-chair Adam Laxalt called “improper votes.” That lawsuit was not immediately filed.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;6 p.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;President Donald Trump is set to make his first public appearance since the early morning hours after Election Day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The White House says Trump will deliver remarks at 6:30 p.m. Thursday from the press briefing room.
 It was unclear if he would take questions.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump last appeared in public early Wednesday, when he falsely declared victory over Democrat Joe Biden in the presidential race.
 Trump has also publicly called for vote counting to stop by citing baseless allegations of fraud and misconduct.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The presidential race has not yet been called because neither Trump nor Biden has yet collected the requisite 270 Electoral College votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden’s victories in Michigan and Wisconsin have put him in a commanding position to win the presidency, but Trump has showed no sign of giving up.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;5:50 p.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Trump campaign and Republican National Committee have asked an Arizona judge to let them join a lawsuit that alleges vote tabulation equipment in metro Phoenix was unable to record a voter’s ballot because she completed it with a county-issued Sharpie pen.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;They argued that anecdotal accounts of potential tabulation errors resulting from Sharpies demands further review and that they should be allowed to participate in the lawsuit because it will likely affect their interests in the tabulation of votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The lawsuit seeks a court order for all Maricopa County voters whose ballots were rejected as a result of using a Sharpie to be given a chance to fix their ballots.
 It also asks for such voters to be able to be present while election officials count their ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Arizona Democratic Party earlier asked to join the lawsuit, arguing that Democratic voters could be disenfranchised if the woman who filed the lawsuit was able to challenge a voter’s intent in making ballot choices without knowing the applicable standards.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A judge is holding a hearing Thursday in Phoenix in the lawsuit by Phoenix-area voter Laurie Aguilera, who also alleged ink from the marker bled through the back side of her ballot and that poll workers refused her request for a new ballot.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;4:30 p.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Democrat Joe Biden says he feels “very good” about the outcome of the presidential election and is telling his supporters to “stay calm” as votes continue to be counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden delivered brief remarks Thursday at a theater in downtown Wilmington, Delaware.
 He says, “It is the will of the voters — no one, not anyone else — who chooses the president of the United States of America.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;President Donald Trump’s campaign has pursued legal efforts to halt the vote counting in some states and is seeking a recount in Wisconsin.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden says that “the process is working” and “we’ll know very soon” the outcome of the election.
 Biden and his top campaign officials have expressed confidence about the vote but have been careful to emphasize the need for every ballot to be counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden’s running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, stood next to him as he spoke.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Associated Press has not called the presidential race yet because neither Biden nor Trump has secured the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory.
 Several key states remain too early to call — Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;3:35 p.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ordered the U.S.
 Postal Service to perform twice daily sweeps of processing centers in states with extended ballot receipt deadlines to check for mail-in votes and to expedite them for delivery.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Thursday’s order will remain in place until the end of states’ windows for accepting ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;According to court records, a similar order by the same judge earlier this week found just 13 ballots in a search of 27 processing hubs in several battleground areas.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Elections officials in key battleground states are continuing presidential vote counting.
 Democrat Joe Biden is urging patience, while President Donald Trump is pursuing his legal options.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Several key states are too early to call — Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;2:25 p.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Joe Biden is getting virtual briefings on the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout from panels of experts, sticking to a routine he’s had since March, even as the outcome of the presidential race remains in doubt.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The former vice president traveled Thursday afternoon to a theater in downtown Wilmington, Delaware, where his campaign has set up a makeshift studio.
 He and his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, often sit facing large screens while experts participate by video conference.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden has held similar public health and economic briefings about once a week since March while criticizing President Donald Trump’s administration for the federal government’s response to a pandemic that has killed more than 230,000 Americans.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Journalists traveling with Biden were not allowed inside the briefing but saw him as he entered the theater.
 He did not take questions.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;2 p.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Arizona Democratic Party has asked a court to let it participate in a lawsuit that alleges vote tabulation equipment in metro Phoenix was unable to record a voter’s ballot because she completed it with a county-issued Sharpie pen.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A judge is holding a hearing Thursday in Phoenix in the lawsuit by voter Laurie Aguilera, who also alleged that ink from the marker bled through the back side of her ballot and that poll workers refused her request for a new ballot.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Aguilera is seeking a court order for all Maricopa County voters whose ballots were rejected as a result of using a Sharpie to be given a chance to fix their ballots.
 She also is asking for such voters to be able to be present while election officials count their ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Democrats say the lawsuit is based on the unconfirmed account of one voter and her request to monitor ballot processing could throw the processing of ballots in Arizona’s largest county in disarray.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In a court filing, the party says Democratic voters could be disenfranchised if Aguilera and others were able to challenge a voter’s intent in making ballot choices without knowing the applicable standards.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Arizona election officials have said voting with a Sharpie would have no impact on the votes being recorded by a tabulation machine.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;1:55 p.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;As the nation awaits results from Nevada, Clark County Registrar Joe Gloria says it could take until Saturday or Sunday before the state’s largest county finishes tallying mail-in ballots that have been returned.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Gloria said Thursday at a press conference: “Our goal here in Clark County is not to count fast.
 We want to make sure that we’re being accurate.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Gloria says Clark County has at least 63,262 ballots left to count, including 34,743 returned in drop boxes on Election Day and 4,208 returned via the U.S.
 Postal Service.
 But as mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day continue to trickle in, Gloria said he had no way of knowing the total number of outstanding ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He says, “That’s a number that I can’t give you.
 I can’t predict to you what’s going to come through the U.S. mail.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Gloria says the fact that Nevada’s six electoral votes could push Democrat Joe Biden beyond the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win the presidency reaffirmed the need to not rush the count.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;He said the last day to count ballots is Nov. 12.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;1:30 p.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A Michigan judge has dismissed a lawsuit by President Donald Trump’s campaign in a dispute over whether Republican challengers had access to the handling of absentee ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Judge Cynthia Stephens noted that the lawsuit was filed late Wednesday afternoon, just hours before the last ballots were counted.
 She also said the defendant, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, was the wrong person to sue because she doesn’t control the logistics of local ballot counting, even if she is the state’s chief election officer.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Associated Press called the Michigan presidential election for Democrat Joe Biden on Wednesday evening.
 Trump won the state in 2016.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The lawsuit claimed Benson, a Democrat, was allowing absentee ballots to be counted without teams of bipartisan observers as well as challengers.
 She was accused of undermining the “constitutional right of all Michigan voters ... to participate in fair and lawful elections.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Benson, through state attorneys, denied the allegations.
 Much of the dispute centered on the TCF Center in Detroit where pro-Trump protesters gathered while absentee ballots were being counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;11:45 a.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;A judge in Georgia has dismissed a lawsuit by the state Republican Party and President Donald Trump’s campaign that asked him to ensure one county was following state laws on processing absentee ballots.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Chatham County Superior Court Judge James Bass did not provide an explanation for his decision Thursday at the close of a roughly one-hour hearing.
 The county includes the heavily Democratic city of Savannah.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The suit had raised concerns about 53 absentee ballots that poll observers said were not part of an original batch of ballots.
 County elections officials testified that all 53 ballots had been received on time.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;11:40 a.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Joe Biden’s campaign is expressing optimism at the ultimate result of the election but warning supporters to “stay patient and stay calm” as vote counting continues.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said Thursday on a briefing call with reporters that “the story of today is going to be a very positive story” for their campaign, but cautioned that as the counting continues, “we need to allow it to get done and get done well.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She says the campaign expects their lead to fluctuate in some states as more votes come in.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;O’Malley Dillon also charged that legal challenges by President Donald Trump’s campaign to halt vote counting in some states and seek a recount in Wisconsin are a “flailing strategy” that are an “attempt to distract and delay” from the results of the election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Associated Press is not calling the presidential race yet because neither candidate has secured the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory.
 Several key states were too early to call — Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;10:38 a.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Arizona state officials say there are about 450,000 ballots still to be counted in the Western battleground.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Associated Press says it is monitoring that vote count as it comes in.
 The AP has called the presidential race in Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;AP executive editor Sally Buzbee says: “The Associated Press continues to watch and analyze vote count results from Arizona.
 We will follow the facts in all cases.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden holds a 2.35 percentage point lead over Trump in Arizona, an advantage of about 68,000 votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The vast majority of the ballots yet to be counted are from Maricopa County, the most populous area of the state.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;This item has been corrected to show that 450,000 ballots, not 375,000 ballots, still need to be counted.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;9:40 a.m.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;With Joe Biden edging closer to unseating him from the White House, President Donald Trump says he wants to put a halt to vote counting.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The extraordinary statement by an incumbent president to voice support for ceasing the count of legally cast votes came in a Thursday morning tweet, saying only: “STOP THE COUNT!”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Elections are run by individual state, county and local governments.
 Trump’s public comments have no impact on the tallying of votes across the country.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;So far, the vote count across the country has been conducted efficiently and without evidence of any misconduct, despite Trump’s public complaints.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump’s comments come as his campaign has filed legal action in several states to try to stop vote counting, claiming a lack of transparency.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Speaking in the White House briefing room Thursday, the president launched into a litany of claims, without proof, about how Democrats were trying to unfairly deprive him of a second term.
 “But we think there’ll be a lot of litigation because we can't have an election stolen like this,” Trump said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Earlier Thursday, a Biden campaign lawyer called the lawsuits meritless, more political strategy than legal.
 “I want to emphasize that for their purposes these lawsuits don’t have to have merit.
 That’s not the purpose.

 A USA Today analysis found that he and his businesses were involved in at least 3,500 state and federal court actions in the three decades before he became president.
 A Michigan judge noted that the state's ballot count is over as she tossed the campaign's lawsuit.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Georgia, a state judge dismissed a case over concerns about 53 absentee ballots in Chatham County after elections officials in the Savannah-area county testified that all of those ballots had been received on time.
 Campaign officials said earlier they were considering similar challenges in a dozen other counties around the state.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Pennsylvania, meanwhile, the Trump campaign won an appellate ruling to get party and campaign observers closer to election workers who are processing mail-in ballots in Philadelphia.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But the order did not affect the counting of ballots that is proceeding in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, as elections officials are dealing with an avalanche of mail ballots driven by fears of voting in person during a pandemic.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The lawsuits in multiple states highlight that the Trump campaign could be confronting a political map in which it might have to persuade courts in two or more states to set aside enough votes to overturn the results.
 Stepien previously cited “irregularities in several Wisconsin counties,” without providing specifics.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Associated Press called Wisconsin and Michigan for Biden on Wednesday.
 The AP has not called Georgia, Nevada or Pennsylvania.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The president's lawyers have asked to intervene in a pending Republican appeal to the Supreme Court over the three-day extension for the receipt and counting of mailed ballots ordered by Pennsylvania's top court.
 Democrats in the state told the justices Thursday that they should put off granting the request because they “may well not need to hear and decide” the matter if Pennsylvania is not critical to the outcome or the late-arriving ballots wouldn't make a difference.
 WE WILL WIN!
 “I’m proud of how transparent and secure our process has been.
 Monitors are not allowed to interfere with the conduct of the election and are typically required to register in advance with the local election office.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Nevada's most populous county, officials said poll watchers were allowed in designated areas, told to comply with social distancing and mask requirements and required to be escorted by county representatives.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“When they sign in, they have to agree to follow the rules that are guided by statute.
 If they don’t follow the rules ... they will be removed from the location,” said Joe Gloria, the chief elections official in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Trump campaign had sought to halt the counting of mail ballots in the county, saying observers were being kept too far away to be able to see if signatures matched voter registration records.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“With the issues that have been reported regarding the election, we are now more than ever concerned with the lack of the transparency in observing and challenging possible invalid ballots,” said Adam Laxalt, co-chair of the Trump campaign in Nevada.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That lawsuit was settled Thursday afternoon after election officials agreed to provide additional access at a ballot processing facility in Las Vegas.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Pennsylvania, disputes over poll watchers were concentrated largely in Philadelphia, where the Trump campaign complained its observers could not get close enough to see whether mail-in ballot envelopes had signatures along with eligible voters' names and addresses.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Ballots without this information could be challenged or disqualified, but city officials said state election law allows poll watchers only to observe the work and not audit it.
 “Some jurisdictions including Philly are also livestreaming, so you can literally watch their counting process from anywhere in the world.
 It's very transparent.\" \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On Thursday, a state judge ordered Philadelphia officials to allow party and candidate observers to move closer to election workers processing mail-in ballots.
 A spokesperson for the Philadelphia board of elections said barriers were shifted in response to the order while the city appealed it.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Later, a federal court in Philadelphia denied a Trump campaign bid to stop the vote count over the access issues, urging the two sides to forge an agreement.
 U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond suggested each party be allowed 60 observers inside the convention center where ballots were being tallied.
 “It applies to both parties equally.
 Everyone has the exact same access.
 Some smaller offices might allow only a few inside, while larger ones could have dozens.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Also Thursday, a Michigan judge dismissed a Trump campaign lawsuit over whether enough Republican poll watchers had access to the handling of absentee ballots.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Much of the dispute centered on Detroit, where absentee ballots were counted at a downtown convention center.
 Some 134 counting boards were set up, and each party was allowed one poll watcher per board, according to City Clerk Janice Winfrey.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;She said she was not aware of any Republican poll watchers being removed but noted some had been “very aggressive, trying to intimidate the poll workers and processors.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Ray Wert, who volunteered as a Democratic poll watcher at the site, said he found a group of Republican supporters blocking the entrance and he observed police officers telling the crowd that no additional people were being let inside because there were equal numbers of partisan poll watchers.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“My concerns are that this is going to be used to delegitimize what is a very clear and very well-run process for counting these ballots,” Wert said.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Cassidy reported from Atlanta, and Izaguirre reported from Lindenhurst, New York.

 And while Democrats are likely to retain control for two more years, their current 232-197 majority could easily shrink.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Here, Dustin Weaver, Congress editor for The Associated Press, answers three quick questions about what this could mean.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;WHAT'S THE PRACTICAL EFFECT?\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Well, what it means is that Speaker Pelosi and her Democratic leadership team are going to have less of a margin of error to pass legislation.
 Pelosi likes to say that votes are the “currency of the realm,\" and when you have less of them to spend it can make passing bills harder.
 No challengers to her position have emerged, however, and some Democrats are saying they don't expect to see one.
 After all, Democrats still seem to have won the majority.
 The Democrats have a number of theories about what went wrong.
 Some say they didn't fight hard enough against the Republican message that they want socialism.
 Others are frustrated that they were told not to knock on doors during the pandemic and instead rely on virtual events.
 Some say they made a mistake by not passing more virus aid before the election, and others say the party just hasn't come to terms with what makes President Donald Trump so popular among a large swath of voters.
 That's because it's looking like their expected gains in the House aren't happening.
 Democrats and Republicans prioritized different issues, lived in different communities and even voted on different kinds of ballots.
 Even the vote count itself threatens to further split Americans.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Except for the Civil War, I don’t think we’ve lived through any time as perilous as this in terms of the divisions,” said historian Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Even after the 2000 election, when the Supreme Court ultimately intervened on Republican George W. Bush’s behalf, Democrat Al Gore quickly conceded and congressional leaders found areas of agreement on Capitol Hill.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“To come out of something like this, you need to have a leader who can lead and willing followers,” Perry said.
 “I just don’t see willing followers on either side.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The yawning divides will threaten the next president’s ability to manage multiple crises: Daily coronavirus infections set a record this week, the economy is struggling to recover from the pandemic and many Americans are pressing for a reckoning on racial injustices.
 Biden voters overwhelming say they want the federal government to prioritize limiting the spread of the virus, even if that means further damage to the economy.
 But most Trump voters preferred an approach that focused on the economy.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;On race and justice issues, Biden voters almost universally said racism is a serious problem in U.S. society and in policing.
 But only a slim majority of Trump voters, who are overwhelming white, called racism a serious problem.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Biden has tried to bridge this gap, often appealing to a sense of national unity and the “soul” of America.
 Trump often casts himself as a defender of his voters.
 He has threatened to withhold pandemic-related aid from states run by Democratic governors and disparaged cities run by Democrats.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Many Democrats desperately hoped that Trump would suffer an embarrassing and broad defeat that would serve as a clear repudiation of Trump and his brand of politics.
 At the very least, they wanted an unambiguous mandate that would allow Biden to pursue ambitious policies on health care, education and the economy.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump may lose, but strong GOP turnout in battlegrounds and unexpectedly solid victories for Republican candidates in Senate and House races made Tuesday far from a thumping.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There's certainly not a clarion call to go in one direction or another.
 There’s a lot of confusion and chaos,\" said civil rights leader Martin Luther King III, who supported Biden.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The election solidified the parties' competing coalitions.
 Biden relied on urban and suburban voters, particularly women, college-educated voters and people of color.
 Trump exceeded his turnout numbers from 2016 by relying on thousands of new supporters from rural, GOP pockets of white voters across the country.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Results in high-turnout counties underscore that trend: Republican-leaning places became more Republican and Democratic areas more Democratic.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Democratic margin increased in 70% of the counties that went for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and the Republican margin widened in 56% of counties that Trump won that year, according to an Associated Press analysis of all counties that by Thursday evening had tallied more votes than in the last presidential election.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That dynamic toppled some Democrats who had won seats in politically mixed areas by running as moderates.
 In Iowa, for example, Democrat Rep. Abby Finkenauer lost her reelection bid in the eastern part of the state as Trump bolstered his margins in rural areas such as Buchanan County just west of Dubuque.
 Trump won the rural county, which is 96% white, by 15 percentage points in 2016.
 That jumped to 21 percentage points this year.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;That geographic polarization is part of what worries those who see the culture of cooperation in Washington rapidly eroding.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Former New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg, a leading Republican voice in the days after the Supreme Court decided the 2000 election, said it's unclear whether congressional leaders will have an incentive to work with the other party.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“There were people in the Senate like Ted Kennedy and Ted Stevens who held strong views but were there first and foremost to get things done and govern, so they did not fear their base and were willing to compromise,” said Gregg, who has emerged as a Trump critic.
 “I am not sure that type of leadership is there today because of the strident voices that dominate both parties.
 But Biden, if president, has seen how it can be done, so we can hope.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;___\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Associated Press data journalist Angeliki Kastanis contributed to this report.

 They must be received by 5 p.m. Friday in order to be counted.
 It was unclear how many ballots remained to be counted Friday evening.
 Three of those changed the outcome of the election.
 The initial margins in those races were 137 votes, 215 votes and 261 votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Among all 31 recounts, the largest shift in results was 0.1%, in the 2006 race for Vermont’s Auditor of Accounts.
 This was a low turnout election in which the initial results had one candidate winning by 137 votes.
 The candidate eventually lost by 102 votes, for a swing of 239 votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump and Biden were locked in a tight contest Friday to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
 Georgia is a must-win state for Trump, who has a narrower path to victory than Biden.
 Trump prematurely declared he was winning it early Wednesday morning.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;GEORGIA'S POLITICAL PROFILE\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Georgia has long been a Republican stronghold.
 Voters there haven’t swung for a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1992.
 Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by 5 percentage points in 2016.
 And the state’s government is dominated by the GOP.
 As older, white, Republican-leaning voters die, they are being replaced by a younger and more racially diverse cast of people, many of whom moved to the booming Atlanta area from other states — and took their politics with them.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Overall, demographic trends show that the state’s electorate is becoming younger and more diverse each year.
 Like other metro areas, Atlanta’s suburbs have also moved away from Republicans.
 In 2016, Hillary Clinton flipped both Cobb and Gwinnett counties, where Biden is currently leading.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In 2018, Democrat Stacey Abrams galvanized Black voters in her bid to become the country’s first African American woman to lead a state, a campaign she narrowly lost.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Many political analysts say it's not a question of if but rather when Georgia becomes a swing state.
 That much was clear in the closing weeks of the campaign as Biden; his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris; and former President Barack Obama barnstormed the state.
 The lawsuit in Georgia asked for a judge's order to make sure the state is following the law around absentee ballots.
 But judges already swatted down the Michigan and Georgia ones.
 They could still be appealed, though.
 Counting votes just takes more time than in past years because the coronavirus pandemic has changed the way people go about it.
 But the Trump campaign says these lawsuits are necessary anyway.
 Meanwhile, Biden campaign attorney Bob Bauer says the suits have no merit and are just meant to spread a false narrative about the electoral process.
 He said it's more about Trump's own effort to discredit the election.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;CAN THESE LEGAL MANEUVERS HAVE CONSEQUENCES?\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Sure.
 Bush v. Gore in 2000 was a good example of how litigation can affect the outcome of an election.
 But legal experts say today, a lawsuit with that kind of power would have to come out of a state where the result there would determine who wins the overall election.
 Also, the difference between the candidates’ vote totals would have to be smaller than the ballots at stake in the lawsuit.
 When absentee ballots could be counted until, whether you had to wear a mask, that kind of thing.
 Some of them were still live on Nov. 3, but most were sorted out.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;One race in Georgia is headed to a January runoff.
 A second contest in Georgia and races in North Carolina and Alaska remain undecided, leaving the chamber now deadlocked 48-48.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The counting continued in Georgia, where GOP Sen. David Perdue was trying to hold off Democrat Jon Ossoff in a multi-candidate race that could also go to a runoff if neither candidate clears the 50% threshold to win.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;There already is a Jan. 5 runoff in the state's other Senate race.
 GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler will face Democrat Raphael Warnock, a Black pastor at the church where the Rev.
 Martin Luther King Jr. preached, after they emerged as top vote-getters, but failed to clear the majority threshold.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;While Democrats picked up must-win seats in Colorado and Arizona, they suffered a setback in Alabama, and Republicans held their own in one race after another — in South Carolina, Iowa, Texas, Kansas and Montana.
 That dramatically limited Democrats' hopes to make inroads.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Maine, Sen. Susan Collins' victory over Democrat Sara Gideon was especially important for Republicans, holding a seat in a state where Trump was not expected to win.
 For Collins, it was the hardest-fought race of her career.
 Democrats had tried to tie the moderate to Trump and criticized her for her vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Many races attracted an unprecedented outpouring of small-dollar donations for Democrats.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"You wasted a lot of money,” said White House ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., after defeating Jaime Harrison, despite the Democrat's stunning $100 million haul for his upstart campaign.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;But Harrison energized voters, among several Black Democratic candidates for Senate including Warnock, drawing an outpouring of national support in a year of racial reckoning, enthusiasm that will be tested again in 2021.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“This is the most important race in the country right now,\" Warnock said in a fundraising appeal.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Securing the Senate majority will be vital for the winner of the presidency.
 Senators confirm administration nominees, including the Cabinet, and can propel or stall the White House agenda.
 John Hickenlooper defeated GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, and Arizona, where former astronaut Mark Kelly beat Republican incumbent Martha McSally.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;“Stop the count!” they chanted in Detroit.
 In New York, hundreds paraded past boarded-up luxury stores on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, and in Chicago, demonstrators marched through downtown and along a street across the river from Trump Tower.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In New York, hundreds of people paraded past boarded-up luxury stores on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, and in Chicago, demonstrators marched through downtown and along a street across the river from Trump Tower.
 Those protesters were demonstrating about a range of issues, including police brutality and the counting of the vote.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Here, Elizabeth Kennedy, deputy Washington bureau chief for The Associated Press, who is leading coverage of election-related protests, breaks down what AP journalists across the United States have been encountering.
 But really it’s like spirits are high — and tensions are high.
 The country is in a very tense moment, not just because of the election but because of 2020.
 We have been in this place of racial tensions, the coronavirus, politics.
 This election is sort of pushing every American sore point.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;ARE THE PROTESTS AT THE LEVEL THAT WAS EXPECTED?\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It’s still early days.
 We have no winner.
 There was no widespread violence at the polls or in the immediate aftermath.
 We're hearing people take up (Donald) Trump's message of “stop the count” and also people echoing the other side — “count every vote.” It remains to be seen if a spark ignites these tensions.
 So far, that has not happened in any widespread way.
 We found no violations of the rules whatsoever,” Link told rbb.
 “He has neither the right nor the possibility to do this.
 ”There will be no red states and blue states when we win.
 Biden led by 0.624 percentage point out of nearly 3.3 million ballots counted.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Since 2016, Democrats had been haunted by the crumbling of the blue wall, the trio of Great Lakes states — Pennsylvania is the third — that their candidates had been able to count on every four years.
 But Trump's populist appeal struck a chord with white working-class voters and he captured all three in 2016 by a total margin of just 77,000 votes.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Both candidates this year fiercely fought for the states, with Biden's everyman political persona resonating in blue-collar towns while his campaign also pushed to increase turnout among Black voters in cities like Detroit and Milwaukee.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Pennsylvania remained too early to call Wednesday night.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;It was unclear when or how quickly a national winner could be determined after a long, bitter campaign dominated by the coronavirus and its effects on Americans and the national economy.
 A win in any undecided state except for Alaska — but including Nevada, with its six votes — would be enough to end Trump’s tenure in the White House.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump spent much of Wednesday in the White House residence, huddling with advisers and fuming at media coverage showing his Democratic rival picking up key battlegrounds.
 Trump falsely claimed victory in several key states and amplified unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Democratic gains as absentee and early votes were tabulated.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said the president would formally request a Wisconsin recount, citing “irregularities\" in several counties.
 And the campaign said it was filing suit in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia to demand better access for campaign observers to locations where ballots are being processed and counted, and to raise absentee ballot concerns.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;At the same time, hundreds of thousands of votes were still to be counted in Pennsylvania, and Trump’s campaign said it was moving to intervene in the existing Supreme Court litigation over counting mail-in ballots there.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The unsettled nature of the presidential race was reflective of a somewhat disappointing night for Democrats, who had hoped to deliver a thorough repudiation of Trump's four years in office while also reclaiming the Senate to have a firm grasp on all of Washington.
 But the GOP held onto several Senate seats that had been considered vulnerable, including in Iowa, Texas, Maine and Kansas.
 Democrats lost House seats but were expected to retain control there.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The high-stakes election was held against the backdrop of a historic pandemic that has killed more than 232,000 Americans and wiped away millions of jobs.
 The U.S. on Wednesday set another record for daily confirmed coronavirus cases as several states posted all-time highs.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The candidates spent months pressing dramatically different visions for the nation’s future, including on racial justice, and voters responded in huge numbers, with more than 100 million people casting votes ahead of Election Day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump, in an extraordinary move from the White House, issued premature claims of victory — which he continued on Twitter Wednesday — and said he would take the election to the Supreme Court to stop the counting.
 It was unclear exactly what legal action he could try to pursue.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell discounted the president’s quick claim of victory, saying it would take a while for states to conduct their vote counts.
 In presidential elections, a key point is the date in December when presidential electors met.
 That’s set by federal law.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Dozens of Trump supporters chanting “Stop the count!” descended on a ballot-tallying center in Detroit, while thousands of anti-Trump protesters demanding a complete vote count took to the streets in cities across the U.S.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Protests — sometimes about the election, sometimes about racial inequality — took place Wednesday in at least a half-dozen cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis and San Diego.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Several states allow mailed-in votes to be accepted as long as they were postmarked by Tuesday.
 That includes Pennsylvania, where ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 can be accepted if they arrive up to three days later.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump appeared to suggest those ballots should not be counted, and that he would fight for that outcome at the high court.
 But legal experts were dubious of Trump's declaration.
 Trump has appointed three of the high court's nine justices — including, most recently, Amy Coney Barrett.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Trump campaign on Wednesday pushed Republican donors to dig deeper into their pockets to help finance legal challenges.
 Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, during a donor call, spoke plainly: “The fight’s not over.
 Turnout was higher than in 2016 in numerous counties, including all of Florida, nearly every county in North Carolina and more than 100 counties in both Georgia and Texas.
 That tally seemed sure to increase as more counties reported their turnout figures.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Voters braved worries of the coronavirus, threats of polling place intimidation and expectations of long lines caused by changes to voting systems, but appeared undeterred as turnout appeared it would easily surpass the 139 million ballots cast four years ago.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;——-\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Jaffe reported from Wilmington, Delaware.
 Still, it was too soon for the GOP to declare victory.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Michigan, Democrats were spared a loss late Wednesday when Sen. Gary Peters beat back a tough challenge from Republican John James.
 But Republicans held on to Susan Collins in Maine and other key seats across the map.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said President Donald Trump’s campaign helped his GOP allies, but that state election officials were still counting ballots.
 He secured a seventh term in a costly campaign, fending off Democrat Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Election night delivered a jarring outcome for Democrats who had devised an expanded political map, eager to counter Trump and his party’s grip on the Senate.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The races attracted an unprecedented outpouring of small-dollar donations for Democrats, from Americans apparently voting with their pocketbooks to propel long-shot campaigns.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The voters’ choices will force a rethinking of Democratic Party strategy, messaging, and approach in the Trump era.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;\"You wasted a lot of money,” said White House ally Sen. Lindsey Graham in Columbia, South Carolina, after defeating Jamie Harrison, despite the Democrat's stunning $100 million haul for his upstart campaign.
 “This is the worst return on investment in the history of American politics.”\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Trump loomed large over the Senate races as did Democratic rival Joe Biden.
 Senators confirm administration nominees, including the Cabinet, and can propel or stall the White House agenda.
 With Republicans now controlling the chamber, 53-47, three or four seats will determine party control, depending on who wins the presidency because the vice president can break a tie in the Senate.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Democrats contested seats from New England to the Deep South and the Midwest to the Mountain West, reaching deep into GOP strongholds.
 But by early Wednesday, the tally was not too different from before Election Day.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Democrats' gains were in Colorado and Arizona, where former astronaut Mark Kelly beat GOP incumbent Martha McSally.
 Steve Bullock; and in Kansas, Rep. Roger Marshall prevailed over state Sen. Barbara Bollier, a former Republican who energized Democrats in a state that hasn’t elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Maine, Susan Collins won the hardest-fought race of her career, securing a fifth term by defeating Democrat Sara Gideon.
 She declared victory Wednesday afternoon and said the outcome was “affirmation of the work that I’m doing in Washington.” Democrats had tried to tie the moderate Republican to Trump and criticized her for her vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The final breakdown awaited the outcome of races in Alaska, Georgia and North Carolina.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis has struggled against Democrat Cal Cunningham, despite the married challenger’s sexting scandal with a public relations strategist.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In Georgia, two seats were being contested and at least one is headed to a runoff after no candidate reached the 50% threshold to win.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler will face Democrat Raphael Warnock, a Black pastor at the church where the Rev.
 Martin Luther King Jr. preached, in the Jan. 5 runoff special election for the seat Loeffler was tapped to fill for retired Sen. Johnny Isakson.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In the other Georgia race, GOP Sen. David Perdue, the former business executive Trump calls his favorite senator, tried to stave off Democrat Jon Ossoff, another candidate who has benefited from the “green wave” of campaign donations.
 It, too, could go to a runoff.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;Republicans were on defense in most states.
 But in the presidential battleground of Michigan, Republicans made an aggressive push for James, a Black Republican businessman who stood by Trump at a rally late Monday.
 James came up short in his effort to unseat Peters.\u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;In South Carolina, Harrison energized voters, among several Black Democratic candidates for Senate including Warnock, drawing an outpouring of national support in a year of racial reckoning.
 \u003c/p&gt;\u003cp&gt;The Senate will welcome some newcomers as others retire.
 In New Mexico, Democrat Ben Ray Lujan, a member of House leadership, was elected to the seat held by Democrat Tom Udall.
 Tennessee Republican Bill Hagerty won the seat held by Republican Lamar Alexander.
