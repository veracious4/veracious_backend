 I`m going to be on "Watch What Happens Live" with Andy Cowen tonight on Bravo, which means I need to run, because that thing is live.
 Luckily it`s already time for "the Last Word with Lawrence O`Donnell."
 Good evening, Lawrence.
 LAWRENCE O`DONNELL, MSNBC ANCHOR: Good evening, Rachel.
 I will be watching.
 MADDOW: Thank you very much.
 O`DONNELL: Start running right now.
 MADDOW: Appreciate it.
 O`DONNELL: Tomorrow, the governor of Texas, who tried to take the presidency away from Barack Obama, will meet with President Obama.
 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Texas showdown about to take place.
 ALEX WAGNER, MSNBC ANCHOR, NOW WITH ALEX WAGNER SHOW: President Obama will visit the state tomorrow and Thursday there is a back and forth.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: With the governor of Texas, Rick Perry.
 CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR, HARDBALL: Children`s hour.
 GOV.
 RICK PERRY (R), TEXAS: I don`t believe he particularly cares.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of grandstanding on both sides.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Governor Perry says when the President arrives in Texas, he won`t will there to treat him.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does not want to have a traditional meeting with the President.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Saying he would not allow for his words, thoughtful discussion.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Politics sometimes is about pictures and pictures matter.
 MATTHEWS: The President, when he was walking with Chris Christie, made good pictures.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The President will meet tomorrow with state leaders in Dallas.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the President extended an invitation for Governor Perry to join his meeting.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Governor Rick Perry has accepted the President`s invitation to attend.
 PERRY: Yu are either inept or you have some ulterior motive.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There`s a lot of political tension as well.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They think that he snap chapped with impoverished children in Honduras?
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That`s going to be a pretty interesting meeting.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It should be good.
 (END VIDEOTAPE)O`DONNELL: President Obama finds himself now in two separate struggles over the southwest border tonight.
 The first is the challenge to get additional money to deal with the growing crisis of immigrants fleeing across the Rio Grande Valley into south Texas.
 Today, the White House submitted a $3.7 billion emergency supplemental request to Congress.
 $1.6 billion to support a deterrent and for enforcement strategy which would include additional resources for border patrol agents, expansion of air surveillance capability and expedition of processes of returning individuals.
 $300 million to supplement existing public media campaigns in Central America.
 And to support repatriation and reintegration efforts.
 And $1 .8 billion to provide care of unaccompanied children.
 Some Republicans are already coming up on opposition to that proposal.
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R), VIRGINIA: $3.7 billion is a slap in the face to the taxpayers of the United States.
 (END VIDEO CLIP)O`DONNELL: The other struggle with President Obama is with Texas governor Rick Perry.
 Governor Perry said this about the President on Sunday.
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PERRY: I don`t believe he particularly cares whether or not the border of the United States is secure.
 We have been bringing to the attention of President Obama and his administration since 2010, he received a letter from me on the tarmac.
 I have to believe that when you do not respond in any way, that you are either inept or you have some ulterior motive of which you are functioning from.
 (END VIDEO CLIP)O`DONNELL: Rick Perry will get a chance to voice his conspiracy theory face to face with President Obama when he visits Dallas tomorrow for meeting of local government officials and faith leaders.
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: When Governor Perry sent a let tore the White House yesterday indicating a desire to meet with the President, we thought it made sense here to extend an invitation to Governor Perry to allow him to participate in that meeting with other Texans who are seeking to address this situation in a constructive manner.
 (END VIDEO CLIP)O`DONNELL: While in Texas, President Obama will not be visiting the border where thousands of people have come across in recent months, many of them say they are fleeing Central American regions overcome by murder and gang violence.
 MSNBC met one such mother, Sarah Cirfuentes fled to Texas from Guatemala with her 2-year-old son.
 A dangerous journey she now says she would not make again.
 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TEXT: In the last year, South Texas` Rio Grande Valley region has seen a dramatic uptick on the number of unaccompanied minors and families coming from Central America to the U.S.
 Many immigrants make the from counties like Guatemala, where more than 50 percent of the country lives below the poverty line and violent crime is widespread.
 Guatemala mother, Sara Cirfuentes, and her son are among the thousands of mothers and children fleeing from their home countries out of fear for their lives.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through text): A year ago, they killed my son`s father and they threatened our entire family.
 We didn`t give much importance.
 Bu eight months later after they killed my son`s father, they killed his uncle.
 I don`t know if they are (INAUDIBLE) or if they are drug lords, I don`t know.
 I don`t know why they did what they did.
 I`m running away basically because I got really scared.
 After eight months of them being afraid, my mom told me I should leave.
 People go through so much to get here.
 It is really hard.
 It`s not just picking up and doing.
 You have t travel on mountains to get on buses, deal with the Mexican police.
 A lot of things happened to us.
 When Mexican police tool a;; of my money, they treated me like I had done something wrong.
 (END VIDEOTAPE)O`DONNELL: Joining me now, MSNBC`s Krystal Ball and Ari Melber and Norma Garcia, anchor for Telemundo 39 in Dallas, Texas.
 Norma, what do people expect to see of the President tomorrow in Texas?
 NORMA GARCIA, ANCHOR, TELEMUNDO 39, DALLAS: We`ve been following the story closely.
 Before, there was no hand shake.
 The governor said there was not enough.
 And now we know that there is a meeting.
 What we can expect from the meeting is probably something very quick.
 The President will only be here about four hours.
 I don`t believe that`s enough time to get to the bottom of this matter.
 But I think meeting is better than handshake and probably a trip to the border would have been better than both.
 O`DONNELL: Krystal, what about the trip to the border?
 Should the president be doing that?
 KRYSTAL BALL, MSNBC HOST, THE CYCLE: You know, Republicans had seized on this idea that the President should go to the border.
 Some Democrats have also been critical.
 To me, the issue of the optics, whether or not he goes to the border, is not really the vital issue here.
 I think the vital issue is the policy.
 And so far, the administration has moved essentially to beef up border security in an attempt to appease Republicans and to process these children as quickly as they can.
 And they have indicated they want to send the majority of them back, when the U.N. is saying that actually a majority of these children may qualify for refugee status and be able to seek asylum in the U.S.
 So I`m more concerned about the policies and the optics of whether or not he happens to go to the border.
 O`DONNELL: But Ari, policy is always more important, and then the politics -- or the optics, as we say, ends up determines more than it should.
 But with a democratic congressman in Texas saying this could be President Obama`s Katrina if he does not go and take a real look at what`s happening there in the same way that George W. Bush did not go and take a real look at what was happening in New Orleans after Katrina.
 ARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST, THE CYCLE: Yes.
 And I think the politics and the perception of that do matters.
 So that is a reality.
 I would second Krystal`s point, which I think is a more optimistic or hopeful one, which is let`s try to stay focused on the right things here.
 Also to this point, why don`t all the members of Congress who haven`t said where they stand on a actual concrete proposal, why doesn`t even of them go and visit and take a look at these children, these children who are stuck and decide whether or not there`s any of that money that we should actually put forward.
 Because if you look at the bill, and you, of course, explicated it here at the top of your show, a lot of what`s in there is very practical stuff, not left-right stuff, not solve the whole immigration asylum problem stuff, but do we want more case officers to help process these children, many of whom are here as minors, didn`t necessarily make this choice and now need help.
 Do we want more, as you mentioned, Lawrence, public education campaigns in Central America where people are being preyed upon in the worse ways and told to risk their families` lives to make a trip that will not end well for them.
 I would say to these members of Congress, if they haven`t said where they stood, go and look at the children, then come back and tell us whether we get an up or down vote.
 O`DONNELL: Norma, we`ve all seen politicians make ceremonial visits to different locations.
 And on a thing like this, of you were to go to a border station, I can`t imagine what anything of any real utility he would actually learn by going there.
 What would you suggest it is possible for the President to learn by -- and where should he go to observe what`s really happening there?
 GARCIA: Well, probably the Rio Grande Valley sector, which is the area where most of the children from Central America are coming through.
 From the perspective of a reporter, I believe that it`s always better to see the problem firsthand.
 Of course, the President has the agenda.
 He will be here tomorrow.
 So just like being in Texas, I think he will get to understand the magnitude of the problem.
 But there is a crisis going on in our south Texas border.
 I don`t think anybody can deny that.
 But seeing the problem firsthand would probably give him a different perspective.
 O`DONNELL: But you know, the problem is not, Krystal, on the border at the border station.
 It`s the video we`re looking at right now.
 These people are in Mexico at that point.
 They have not come to the crossing point.
 I think if there`s anything for the President to see, I think it is worth seeing, is that trail, is that experience of what these people are going through to get to our border.
 And I think he could shine a light only that the way JFK shined a light on the poverty in Appalachia.
 That people kind of were aware that it was rough there, but no one had any idea how bad it was until that Presidential spotlight went down there.
 BALL: I think that`s right.
 I mean, another thing that in terms of Norma`s point about a reporter being able to see the situation firsthand in terms of the policy that he could impact, also visiting one of the detention centers where children and young families are right now and this would give him an opportunity to speak to them about their journey and about the reasons that they fled their country to come to this country.
 And I think that`s actually the exactly some of the imagery that he is fearful of having out there, because the conditions in these detention centers, as you we`re seeing the images right now on the screen, they`re pretty grim.
 And for him to be associated with that visual I think is something that this administration has decided they don`t want to go there.
 Well Ari, he`s associated -- if you`re the President, this is happening on your watch, this is, in a certain sense, the executive branch creation down there.
 I mean, it seems to me that the only option he has in relation to the people in those places is to actually go there so that we can see what his enforcement procedures are actually creating.
 MELBER: Right.
 He can do that and he can also say look, we`ve done a bunch of other things behind the scenes.
 The foreign policy was there weeks ago.
 Vice President Biden went down to Central America, did these meetings with heads of state in person and on the phone in some cases and continued to press the case, the foreign policy case, that they`ve got to get control and help carry this message in every way they can that these families should not be recruited up here.
 The problem with that, it is the problem you see in a lot of asylum cases, and there`s a reason why this was original law that created this process was so bipartisan, because there`s a lot of places like Honduras where it is so terrible, that no matter how bad that journey is, people still need to make it because what they`re facing at home is that terrible.
 And that`s why it was Honduras, it was sex trafficking.
 There was a lot of terrible stuff out there that members of Congress said hey, help these people get asylum.
 BALL: Yes, and the U.N. in their report on this crisis, when they were interviewing children, the children were not saying we came here because it would be easy.
 They said we are leaving because of violence.
 We are leaving because we`re afraid we`re going to be killed or raped.
 So that is really the driving force here.
 O`DONNELL: Krystal Ball, Ari Melber and Norma Garcia, thank you all very much.
 MELBER: Thank you, Lawrence.
 BALL: Thank, Lawrence.
 O`DONNELL: Coming up, Chris Christie vetoes a gun bill because apparently he still believes he can win the Republican Presidential nomination.
 And later, Harry Potter and the world cup.
 You`ll have to see what that is all about in the spotlight tonight.
 Harry Potter`s back.
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)O`DONNELL: OK. I`m going to confess what is probably the obvious.
 I don`t know much about Harry Potter.
 But I have a Harry Potter wizard who is going to join me and explain how Harry Potter has come back and kind of connected to the world cup.
 That`s coming up.
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)O`DONNELL: Yesterday, Chris Christie was forced to defend his decision to veto a ten-round limitation on ammunition magazines.
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV.
 CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY: Mike, I`ve heard the argument.
 And so, are we saying that the ten children on the clip that they advocate for, that their lives are less valuable?
 If you take the logical conclusion of their argument, you go to zero, because every life is valuable.
 And so why ten?
 Why not six?
 Why not two?
 Why not one?
 Why not zero?
 Why not just ban guns completely?
 (END VIDEO CLIP)O`DONNELL: Here`s how former Republican politician and admirer of Chris Christie Joe Scarborough reacted to that.
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST, MORNING JOE: The logic, the ten precious children logic, it`s so convoluted that I don`t think he can say that with a straight face.
 I think he would be embarrassed to say that to parents who lost their children.
 (END VIDEO CLIP)O`DONNELL: Which, of course, is a reasonable explanation of why Chris Christie refused to meet with two parents who lost their children in the massacre of first graders in Newtown, Connecticut.
 What Chris Christie is ignoring is the incontrovertible fact that the sooner a mass murderer has to reload, the sooner that mass murderer is likely to be stopped.
 That is exactly how the mass murder who shot Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and murdered six people was stopped.
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PATRICIA MAISON, DISARMED TUCSON SHOOTER: The gunman was now down partly on top of me, and I saw the colonel and -- I didn`t know who it was then, and Roger Salsberg had flattened him.
 He is on his right side.
 I immediately got to my knees and they were shouting, "grab the gun, grab the gun."
 And I couldn`t reach the gun because it was in his right hand and that was the distant one from me.
 As they were doing that, he pulled out a magazine from his left pocket and had it in his hand but he dropped it on the sidewalk.
 And I was able to recover it before he could get it.
 (END VIDEO CLIP)O`DONNELL: This morning on MSNBC, Joe Scarborough identified what he thinks is controlling Chris Christie`s position on this issue.
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SCARBOROUGH: I think it`s kind of chicken something, which I won`t say on the air.
 There is a second word.
 I mean, the two words, again, it`s chicken we`ll say salad for Chris Christie to not meet with these families at least for five, ten minutes.
 This proves that Chris Christie still thinks he can win the Republican nomination for President of the United States.
 (END VIDEO CLIP)O`DONNELL: Joining me now is David Corn, the Washington bureau chief for "Mother Jones" and `Washington Post" columnist Jonathan Capehart.
 Both are MSNBC political analysts.
 Jonathan, what Chris Christie was ignoring when he was rattling off, you know, about five, six, you know, or two or one or no bullets is the constitutional limitation.
 The Supreme Court has said clearly there is individual right to bear arms.
 And that Supreme Court does believe there is a reasonable limitation on ammunition devices like this.
 And you have to pick a number that is within their notion of reasonable and in the past they found nine was the federal law for a very long period of time.
 So when you`re at ten, you`re going to clearly survive a constitutional challenge.
 And if you went down to, you know, four or three or two, as Christie was suggesting, there would be absolutely no chance of surviving the constitutional challenge.
 JONATHAN CAPEHART, OPINION WRITER, THE WASHINGTON POST: Right.
 And I think the key word in your question is reasonable.
 There`s nothing reasonable about the Republican primary base.
 I mean, let`s just go under the assumption that the reason why Chris Christie is doing this is because he`s trying to curry favor with potential Republican primary voters for a potential 2016 Presidential run.
 There`s nothing reasonable about the pro-gun folks within the Republican Party who don`t want any kind of restrictions, reasonable or not.
 And so for Chris Christie to give that horribly convoluted answer.
 And I have to agree with Joe in his description of Governor Christie and his inability or unwillingness to meet with those two Newtown parents, I agree with him.
 Chris Christie is someone who has made a reputation as being someone who is not afraid of a challenge, unafraid to go and take on a challenge, take on a problem, you know, head first.
 And in this case, he couldn`t find the time, five minutes, ten minutes, to meet with these two -- with these two families to hear them out.
 Senator Cruz was able to do that, why not Governor Christie?
 I think we know the answer to that.
 O`DONNELL: David Corn, could you imagine there would be a day when Joe Scarborough and other Republican analysts would look at Chris Christie on some issue and say well, he`s just chicken, he`s just afraid of addressing it honestly?
 I mean, if Christie had a reputation a year ago, it was well, you know, he`s the straight talking tough guy.
 DAVID CORN, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes.
 Well, he is that`s certainly out the window now.
 And he can look at the Republican Presidential primary horizon and stretch things out pretty well.
 If he voted for any type of -- or if he approved any type of gun control bill, he would be even greater toast.
 I don`t know how you go beyond the toast that he is.
 O`DONNELL: Well, that`s the thing, you can`t.
 (CROSSTALK)CORN: It`s quite clear in his mind what he say about the bridgegate and everything else that he still thinks he has a shot.
 O`DONNELL: Yes, he does.
 CORN: So anyway, that`s what he`s operating on.
 But I have to say, you know, we talk -- Joe and others have taken on the absurdity of his argument, why ten, why not nine?
 Are those lives any more value or less value than the others?
 Or by that same exact reasoning, why not have clips of 50 or 100 or 200?
 Because the law is between 10 and 100 are just the same.
 I mean, it`s really quite bizarro (ph) and if he ever gets the Republican nomination, which he won`t, this will come back to haunt him.
 But he is a diluted fellow on a lot of friends and we will see how it goes on the next six months.
 O`DONNELL: Well, yes.
 Jonathan, that`s a great point, that the Christie logic pulled in both directions would allow people to have, you know, fighter planes.
 (CROSSTALK)O`DONNELL: Anything they want.
 CAPEHART: Yes.
 Here`s what is interesting about what Governor Christie is doing besides his arithmetic.
 So he is taking up this position, this very conservative position on guns to basically, I think mollified the far right and the Republican party base over what he`s done on the gay marriage angle.
 Now, hear me out.
 The courts, the chief judge in the Supreme Court in New Jersey is the one who legalized same-sex marriage in New Jersey.
 And Governor Christie stepped out there and criticized, blasted this guy.
 And I wrote a piece saying, here`s how Governor Christie is going to prove his republican bonafidies (ph), his conservative bonafidies (ph).
 He`s going to dump that Supreme Court chief judge because that guy`s tenure would be up and he can appoint someone new and show the far right that he`s not beholden to this guy.
 Well, you know what happened?
 That judge is still on the bench.
 That judge was reappointed.
 So this gives -- when conservatives start focusing in on Chris Christie and where he is on their issues, on that issue he`s going to fail miserably.
 But when it comes to guns, he`ll just be fine because he wouldn`t even meet with grieving parents who were killed by gun violence.
 CORN: Jonathan, I think you got something there.
 But I also have to say, it doesn`t matter what he`s done in gay marriage.
 You know, guns are the, you know, of the three top issues of a lot of people in the Republican party, it`s guns, guns, and more guns.
 And so, what regardless of -- CAPEHART: I would say guns, God and gays.
 But go on.
 CORN: But I would put guns, guns, guns before you get to God and gays.
 But so, regardless of what he`s done with a judge involved in gay marriage, there is just absolutely no way that he would be competitive at all if he approved any gun control law.
 No matter what he has done in any other front.
 O`DONNELL: He will be as competitive in the Republican nomination race as he would be in the New York marathon.
 (CROSSTALK)O`DONNELL: It`s been over since the time he will had his press conference saying, you know, I rely completely on my staff.
 You cannot run for high office saying I rely completely on my staff.
 And by the way, they all tricked me and betrayed me.
 We`re out of time for tonight.
 David Corn and Jonathan Capehart, thank you both for joining me tonight.
 CAPEHART: Thanks, Lawrence.
 Good to see you.
 CORN: Thank you.
 O`DONNELL: Thank you.
 Coming up, Harry Potter has world cup fever.
 Harry Potter is back.
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who are you?
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Rubius Hagret (ph), keeper of keys and graves at Hogwarts.
 Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sorry, no.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No?
 Didn`t you ever wonder where you mom and dad learned it?
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, no.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You`re a wizard, Harry.
 (END VIDEO CLIP)O`DONNELL: In the spotlight tonight, Harry Potter is back and he has world cup fever.
 J.K. Rowling shocked millions of fans across the world today when she published a new short story on her Web site about Harry Potter, the world`s most famous wizard.
 Rowling wrote the story as part of an online series about the 2014 world cup, the Quidditch (ph) world cup.
 Quidditch (ph) is, of course, the official sport of the wizarding world.
 In the story, which Rowling wrote, in the voice of a fictional gossip columnist, we learn more about the adult lives Harry and his friends.
 Joining me now is host of MSNBC`s "Ronan Farrow daily" and Harry Potter (INAUDIBLE).
 Thank you very much for joining me.
 RONAN FARROW, MSNBC HOST, RONAN FARROW DAILY: That is an honoring title.
 But I`m glad to be here.
 O`DONNELL: Everything I know about Harry Potter just passed us by in the teleprompter.
 OK, that is it.
 That`s the whole thing.
 And that`s the most of Harry Potter movies that I have scene is right there in that screen.
 FARROW: You got the important part.
 O`DONNELL: And I don`t say that proudly.
 I feel kind of out of it.
 My staff, who you know, is -- this was, I lost the vote, and we are doing a Harry Potter story.
 FARROW: This is not the Lawrence passion pick of the night.
 O`DONNELL: Right.
 No.
 But it was unanimous.
 The entire does and you got to do this harry Potter thing.
 What is the big deal about the author doing a little kind of updating today?
 The excitement on my staff, they couldn`t even speak English words about it they were so thrilled.
 FARROW: It is remarkable and everywhere I turn, everyone I talked to, adults are in that state of frenzy about it.
 And it is partly I think people at that particular age, where you grew up with the character and now you want to see them losing their hair the way you are.
 There`s a relatability there.
 And people are just t check in.
 And look, it is phenomenon.
 That said, there are people pushing back.
 A new republic call this is a scam.
 There are these super fans that read this and found it was 1500 words and were incensed about it.
 O`DONNELL: Because they needed another several million words?
 FARROW: They want more.
 They like the tones, they`re attached to the characters.
 O`DONNELL: Someone is mad because she only wrote 1500 words?
 Would they rather have zero on Harry today?
 FARROW: I think the majority of fans are happy.
 I mean, I read it.
 It`s cute.
 There`s not a lot to it.
 You do get that play that play of where these characters are.
 And it`s interesting, partly in that there`s a dark edge to it because it`s this satire of the gossip --.
 O`DONNELL: Yes.
 He does it in a gossip column voice.
 And this little hints in here.
 You know what?
 You should read this instead of me.
 Here is one of her excerpts today.
 FARROW: Time is coming from us all, even Harry.
 The quote is about to turn 34.
 There are couple threads of silver and the famous honor (ph) is black hair.
 But he continues to wear the distinctive round glasses that some might say are better suited to a style deficient 12-year-old.
 O`DONNELL: So we know he has some silver hair.
 We know that.
 FARROW: You really caught on.
 And how old is he now with his silver hair?
 FARROW: He`s 34.
 Look, I mean, we are all hold on for dear life here, Lawrence.
 O`DONNELL: You are going to get there someday.
 FARROW: You got to find me on you.
 But all are so lucky.
 And he`s orer, I don`t know if -- O`DONNELL: That`s right.
 I had you read that because I don`t know what that word means or how to say it.
 FARROW: So an orer is the Navy SEAL equivalent, defense against the darks curse.
 O`DONNELL: OK. FARROW: A very prestigious combative guy now.
 He slips in a little tantalizing tidbits to keep the fans strung along with you.
 He has got a cut on his face.
 We don`t know why.
 She is playing this on -- O`DONNELL: I have to believe that these books did a lot for literacy in America and around the world, because I saw kids carrying these things around who were never going to be carrying books around.
 Yes, they were going to be reading some books, but they had to work their way through massive novels, which is not something that every 12-year-old kid does.
 FARROW: Huge.
 And you know, as the books go on, they welcome more nuanced.
 Look.
 I left those books as an adult, excited fort what she was going to do under her own name or an outs (INAUDIBLE) in the world of adult literature.
 I mean, I think she`s got real skill and artfulness.
 And I say, in addition to helping literacy, she overhauled the way authors relate to their publishers.
 She took control in a way no one ever has before.
 (CROSSTALK)O`DONNELL: You get control.
 Ronan Farrow.
 The "Last Word`s`" senior Harry Potter -- FARROW: I will take it.
 O`DONNELL: Thank you very much.
 No.
 You know, this is great, because I wanted somebody who could explain this to me with enthusiasm, and the first call was Ronan.
 Thank you very much for doing this, Ronan.
 Really appreciate it.
 You can watch "Ronan Farrow Daily" as I do.
 I wake up to this weekdays at 1:00 p.m. eastern.
 I wake up about a minute before.
 FARROW: God bless you.
 O`DONNELL: Coming up, America`s longest running foreign policy mistake just got a little cheaper today.
 That`s on the rewrite.
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)O`DONNELL: Ronan, quickly, (INAUDIBLE) our producer of this Harry Potter segment insisted that we put her Harry Potter hat, whatever it is, what is that doing here?
 FARROW: The sorting hat tells you your existential fate, it tells you what kind of person you are and where you go in the houses of Harry Potter, which are modeled after the Oxford Colleges.
 Gryffindor is the one you want.
 You do not want to find out you`re a slithering.
 If you find out you are a slithering, it`s all over.
 O`DONNELL: So this determines your fate, this thing?
 FARROW: That`s it.
 O`DONNELL: OK. Glad we could clear that up.
 FARROW: I`m not putting it on.
 I don`t want to find out.
 O`DONNELL: It is the biggest prop we`ve had on this desk.
 FARROW: Good one.
 O`DONNELL: Ronan, thank you very much.
 We`ll be back with the rewrite in a minute.
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)O`DONNELL: What would you say if the government created a television network?
 Well, if you`re British, you would probably say the government did a pretty good job, the BBC having delivered some brilliant programming, the high points of which are of course Monty Python and David Brend`s (ph) office.
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The way that we would -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe I should play the hotel manager.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: See if you can phase me, OK?
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 Go ahead.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello, I wish to make a complaint.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not interested.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My room is a disgrace.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don`t care.
 What room are you?
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 362.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is no 362 in this hotel.
 Sometimes the complaints will be false.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.
 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good.
 (END VIDEO CLIP)O`DONNELL: But most government-run television programming around the world is quite dreadful.
 (VIDEO CLIP PLAYING)O`DONNELL: State-run television tends to be a relentlessly dreary deliverer of the current regime`s dreary message.
 And state-run television is about as un-American as you can get.
 And so what most of you Americans would say if the United States government tried to create a television network is, bad idea.
 What the tea party would say is, that`s proof that President Obama intends to stay in office for the rest of his life, and seizing control of television is his first step in suspending Presidential elections.
 And Republicans would say, that`s absolutely outrageous.
 The government has no right to invade the television business.
 But there is a magic word that can get pandering American politicians to support the craziest governing ideas, including the creation of a television network, and that magic word is -- Cuba.
 Twenty four years ago, a Republican President urged the creation of a government-run television network and Congress gave him what he wanted.
 The network called TV Marti, which was designated to broadcast programs to Cuba, which would presumably show Cubans how wonderful life is in the United States.
 And instead of putting them to sleep, it would provoke them to, after some number of hours of watching TV, overthrow the Castro regime.
 This didn`t seem like such a big step for Republicans at the time, because five years earlier, Republican President Ronald Reagan had created a radio Marti, a radio network with the same mission of undermining and hopefully overthrowing the Castro regime.
 Ask any member of Congress back then whether the American government should create a radio network or a television network and the answer would be no.
 Then ask them if the American government should create a radio or television network to broadcast in Cuba and a majority said yes.
 The successive Republican Presidents and members of Congress who wanted to do this were untroubled by the obvious fact at the time that Cuba could block these broadcast signals, because when it comes to the politics of Cuba policy, a majority of politicians have always been in favor of doing something, anything without the slightest regard to how effective that something might be.
 Our 54-year-old embargo of Cuba has been the least effective embargo in history.
 Instead of leading to the overthrow of the Castro regime, it`s always given the Castro brothers an excuse as to why economic development in Cuba is not as strong as it should be and it has done nothing to loosen the regime`s grip on power.
 During the original congressional debate over TV Marti, supporters like congressman (INAUDIBLE), Republican from Florida, herself a Cuban-American, argued that even if the broadcasts do not reach any viewers, Castro must spend valuable money to block the signal.
 But blocking that transmission signal is an awful lot cheaper than the creation of hours and hours of television programming and the transmission of that signal to Cuba.
 Our government`s best estimates of how many Cubans ever see TV Marti indicate it`s less than one percent of Cubans.
 An absolutely crazy idea was hatched during George W. Bush`s presidency to increase that viewership.
 It is one of those nutty ideas that would have been rejected instantly if the word Cuba was not attached to the idea.
 .The idea was, aero Marti, an airplane that would try to circumvent Havana`s jamming of TV Marti signals by flying around Cuba and dropping TV Marti signals from the sky meant to supplement the TV Marti signals already being beamed across a much wider area by direct TV satellites.
 The airplane signal cost ten times more than the direct TV signal.
 And according to the government`s very best estimates again, picked up exactly no more viewers.
 Radio Marti and TV Marti are complete and utter failures.
 But in Cuba policy, failing means never having to say you`re sorry, and never having to stop doing what is failing.
 But aero Marti has taken failure and turned it into disaster, since it increased broadcasting costs dramatically and did not pick up a single viewer.
 And so, a small note of sanity has been struck in our Cuba policy with the quiet collapse of aero Marti`s meaningless circling of the Caribbean skies.
 After $35 .6 million has been wasted on our airplane in the sky, aero Marti has been grounded without a whimper from its supporters who have been happily wasting this money all these years.
 The thing that eventually killed aero Marti was not some brave politician standing up against the lunacy of the American government owning and operating a television network and an airplane that was futilely trying to deliver the broadcast signal of that network.
 What killed our propaganda plane was sequestration.
 Those draconian spending cuts that have done so much damage in so many sectors of our government did at least one very good thing, sequestration made funding for the propaganda plane`s fuel and pilots disappear.
 But TV Marti and radio Marti have survived sequestration, and although radio Marti and TV Marti have spent more than $500 million to reach less than one percent to have Cuban population and as far as we can tell, change their minds about nothing.
 No politician who seriously aspires to the president who will dare to say a word about this wasted $500 million, because when it comes to Cuba policy, the American governor is still crazy after all these years.
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)O`DONNELL: It is almost 11:00 p.m. eastern.
 Do you know where your President is?
 He`s shooting pool and drinking beer with the governor of Colorado in Colorado.
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)O`DONNELL: Monday of next week is Malala day, a day that honors Malala Yousafzai as they did the honors the 17th birthday.
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a story of strength.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Once there was a girl who wanted to go to school.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But there were those who did not want her to learn.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They were afraid education would give her power.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But the girl did not let this stop her.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She dreamed of learning.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was not alone.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Weakness, fear and helplessness died, strength, power and courage was born.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was determined.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was stronger than violence.
 She was stronger than oppression.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was stronger than fear.
 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What are you stronger than?
 Show it to the world on this Malala day.
 (END VIDEO CLIP)O`DONNELL: Malala.org is adding spurs of Malala to share their photos and messages using #stronger than to raise awareness for girls and boys education.
 And nearly two dozen nonprofit groups will announce their own initiatives including the Malala fund.
 Joining me now is Shiza Shahid.
 She is the CEO and co-founder of the Malala fund, which helps empower women around the world.
 Shiza, what is this Malala fund doing?
 What are the main programs you are doing?
 SHIZA SHAHID, CEO, MALALA FUND: Well, the Malal fund is co-founded by myself, Malala and her father.
 And it was really out of our desire to say, yes, Malala was shot.
 Yes, she survived and that is a moment of hope.
 However, there are millions across the world are denied an education.
 And Malala`s attack and her survival should not just be a moment, but a movement that changes the faith of girls in the most difficult circumstances in the world.
 We are currently working in four countries, Pakistan, Jordan, Kenya and soon Nigeria.
 There we do grant making.
 And in addition, we do advocacy, using Malala`s voice and amplifying the voices of other girls to try and bring change globally on this issue.
 O`DONNELL: Talk about this extraordinary 17-year-old.
 This is the kind of person that the world sees once every 50 years, just truly extraordinary.
 It`s hard to think of an example of someone who has had this kind of worldwide impact by the age of 17.
 SHAHID: She is truly remarkable.
 She has the bravery of no one we have ever seen before, to go through what she did and wake up and say, you know what, I`m not done, and I`m going to be louder and stronger than ever before, is something that is truly magical and gives us hope that there is a better tomorrow for all of those girls suffering unspeakable things today.
 O`DONNELL: What kind of protection that she had not?
 Surely the people that tried to kill her before very much still want to kill her.
 SHAHID: Well, Malala is, and without exaggeration, the bravest girl and the world.
 And as she says, before that date, I was a little bit afraid.
 Now I know that even death does not want to stop my mission.
 And so, she is moving forward.
 She is in school.
 She is spending her time on the ground working for the projects of the Malala fund.
 She is raising her voice and traveling to the developing world, to some of the toughest places on Malala day.
 And we believe that death is on her side.
 O`DONNELL: How does her father feel about this?
 I mean, you know, her father almost lost his daughter.
 And one way to deal with this would to be to simply maybe move to England or the United States or somewhere safer and stay out of sight an just protect your life.
 And yet, that is not a choice she is making, and he is supporting her in this choice.
 SHAHID: Her father is a revolutionary.
 He has been one since he was very young and is very much the person who inspired Malala and continues to lift her up.
 He says, what I did to help empower Malala was that I did not cut her wings.
 And that is his approach with her.
 He knows she is very special.
 And they have made a choice that their mission is more important than their lives.
 O`DONNELL: And listen.
 Their feeling that if Malala did retreat and basically go into hiding for her own safety, that would be a form of victory for her opponents and for the people who want her dead?
 SHAHID: I just think that they have always seen their lives as meant for a purpose, and that purpose is so much bigger than the fear for their own safety.
 They are incredibly spiritual, they are incredibly cause and passion driven.
 And they just cannot imagine a life without themselves being dedicated to the greater good.
 O`DONNELL: And we talked a great deal on this program and Malala, obviously, about girls` education.
 But there is a boys` component to this too.
 We need to get the boys educated out of growing up into this attitude of being threatened by girls` education.
 SHAHID: Definitely.
 And if you, educated girls, and you have the man of the community against that, you are putting that girl at risk.
 So education interventions and girls` and women`s interventions must very much engage the community while also and empowering that women.
 Because ultimately, it`s those men who are their fathers, their brothers and their husbands.
 O`DONNELL: Shiza Shahid gets tonight`s "Last Word."
 And there is just no better good news story than we could do than Malala is striving and is 17 and facing a happy birthday coming up.
 Thank you, Shiza, very much.
 SHAHID: Thank you.
 O`DONNELL: Chris Hayes is up next.

 \u003cbr /\u003eToday, the White House submitted a $3.7 billion emergency supplemental \u003cbr /\u003erequest to Congress.
 $1.6 billion to support a deterrent and for \u003cbr /\u003eenforcement strategy which would include additional resources for border \u003cbr /\u003epatrol agents, expansion of air surveillance capability and expedition of \u003cbr /\u003eprocesses of returning individuals.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e$300 million to supplement existing public media campaigns in Central \u003cbr /\u003eAmerica.

 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSome Republicans are already coming up on opposition to that proposal.

 Many immigrants make the from counties \u003cbr /\u003elike Guatemala, where more than 50 percent of the country lives below the \u003cbr /\u003epoverty line and violent crime is widespread.

 I don`t know if they are (INAUDIBLE) or if they are drug \u003cbr /\u003elords, I don`t know.

 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(END VIDEOTAPE)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Joining me now, MSNBC`s Krystal Ball and Ari Melber and Norma \u003cbr /\u003eGarcia, anchor for Telemundo 39 in Dallas, Texas.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNorma, what do people expect to see of the President tomorrow in Texas?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNORMA GARCIA, ANCHOR, TELEMUNDO 39, DALLAS: We`ve been following the story \u003cbr /\u003eclosely.
 Before, there was no hand shake.
 The governor said there was not \u003cbr /\u003eenough.
 And now we know that there is a meeting.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat we can expect from the meeting is probably something very quick.
 The \u003cbr /\u003ePresident will only be here about four hours.
 I don`t believe that`s \u003cbr /\u003eenough time to get to the bottom of this matter.
 But I think meeting is \u003cbr /\u003ebetter than handshake and probably a trip to the border would have been \u003cbr /\u003ebetter than both.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Krystal, what about the trip to the border?
 Should the \u003cbr /\u003epresident be doing that?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eKRYSTAL BALL, MSNBC HOST, THE CYCLE: You know, Republicans had seized on \u003cbr /\u003ethis idea that the President should go to the border.
 Some Democrats have \u003cbr /\u003ealso been critical.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTo me, the issue of the optics, whether or not he goes to the border, is \u003cbr /\u003enot really the vital issue here.
 I think the vital issue is the policy.
 \u003cbr /\u003eAnd so far, the administration has moved essentially to beef up border \u003cbr /\u003esecurity in an attempt to appease Republicans and to process these children \u003cbr /\u003eas quickly as they can.
 And they have indicated they want to send the \u003cbr /\u003emajority of them back, when the U.N. is saying that actually a majority of \u003cbr /\u003ethese children may qualify for refugee status and be able to seek asylum in \u003cbr /\u003ethe U.S.
 So I`m more concerned about the policies and the optics of \u003cbr /\u003ewhether or not he happens to go to the border.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: But Ari, policy is always more important, and then the politics \u003cbr /\u003e-- or the optics, as we say, ends up determines more than it should.
 But \u003cbr /\u003ewith a democratic congressman in Texas saying this could be President \u003cbr /\u003eObama`s Katrina if he does not go and take a real look at what`s happening \u003cbr /\u003ethere in the same way that George W. Bush did not go and take a real look \u003cbr /\u003eat what was happening in New Orleans after Katrina.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST, THE CYCLE: Yes.
 And I think the politics and the \u003cbr /\u003eperception of that do matters.
 So that is a reality.
 I would second \u003cbr /\u003eKrystal`s point, which I think is a more optimistic or hopeful one, which \u003cbr /\u003eis let`s try to stay focused on the right things here.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAlso to this point, why don`t all the members of Congress who haven`t said \u003cbr /\u003ewhere they stand on a actual concrete proposal, why doesn`t even of them go \u003cbr /\u003eand visit and take a look at these children, these children who are stuck \u003cbr /\u003eand decide whether or not there`s any of that money that we should actually \u003cbr /\u003eput forward.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBecause if you look at the bill, and you, of course, explicated it here at \u003cbr /\u003ethe top of your show, a lot of what`s in there is very practical stuff, not \u003cbr /\u003eleft-right stuff, not solve the whole immigration asylum problem stuff, but \u003cbr /\u003edo we want more case officers to help process these children, many of whom \u003cbr /\u003eare here as minors, didn`t necessarily make this choice and now need help.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDo we want more, as you mentioned, Lawrence, public education campaigns in \u003cbr /\u003eCentral America where people are being preyed upon in the worse ways and \u003cbr /\u003etold to risk their families` lives to make a trip that will not end well \u003cbr /\u003efor them.
 I would say to these members of Congress, if they haven`t said \u003cbr /\u003ewhere they stood, go and look at the children, then come back and tell us \u003cbr /\u003ewhether we get an up or down vote.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Norma, we`ve all seen politicians make ceremonial visits to \u003cbr /\u003edifferent locations.
 And on a thing like this, of you were to go to a \u003cbr /\u003eborder station, I can`t imagine what anything of any real utility he would \u003cbr /\u003eactually learn by going there.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat would you suggest it is possible for the President to learn by -- and \u003cbr /\u003ewhere should he go to observe what`s really happening there?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGARCIA: Well, probably the Rio Grande Valley sector, which is the area \u003cbr /\u003ewhere most of the children from Central America are coming through.
 From \u003cbr /\u003ethe perspective of a reporter, I believe that it`s always better to see the \u003cbr /\u003eproblem firsthand.
 Of course, the President has the agenda.
 He will be \u003cbr /\u003ehere tomorrow.
 So just like being in Texas, I think he will get to \u003cbr /\u003eunderstand the magnitude of the problem.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut there is a crisis going on in our south Texas border.
 I don`t think \u003cbr /\u003eanybody can deny that.
 But seeing the problem firsthand would probably \u003cbr /\u003egive him a different perspective.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: But you know, the problem is not, Krystal, on the border at the \u003cbr /\u003eborder station.
 It`s the video we`re looking at right now.
 These people \u003cbr /\u003eare in Mexico at that point.
 They have not come to the crossing point.
 I \u003cbr /\u003ethink if there`s anything for the President to see, I think it is worth \u003cbr /\u003eseeing, is that trail, is that experience of what these people are going \u003cbr /\u003ethrough to get to our border.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd I think he could shine a light only that the way JFK shined a light on \u003cbr /\u003ethe poverty in Appalachia.
 That people kind of were aware that it was \u003cbr /\u003erough there, but no one had any idea how bad it was until that Presidential \u003cbr /\u003espotlight went down there.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBALL: I think that`s right.
 I mean, another thing that in terms of \u003cbr /\u003eNorma`s point about a reporter being able to see the situation firsthand in \u003cbr /\u003eterms of the policy that he could impact, also visiting one of the \u003cbr /\u003edetention centers where children and young families are right now and this \u003cbr /\u003ewould give him an opportunity to speak to them about their journey and \u003cbr /\u003eabout the reasons that they fled their country to come to this country.
 \u003cbr /\u003eAnd I think that`s actually the exactly some of the imagery that he is \u003cbr /\u003efearful of having out there, because the conditions in these detention \u003cbr /\u003ecenters, as you we`re seeing the images right now on the screen, they`re \u003cbr /\u003epretty grim.
 And for him to be associated with that visual I think is \u003cbr /\u003esomething that this administration has decided they don`t want to go there.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell Ari, he`s associated -- if you`re the President, this is happening on \u003cbr /\u003eyour watch, this is, in a certain sense, the executive branch creation down \u003cbr /\u003ethere.
 I mean, it seems to me that the only option he has in relation to \u003cbr /\u003ethe people in those places is to actually go there so that we can see what \u003cbr /\u003ehis enforcement procedures are actually creating.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMELBER: Right.
 He can do that and he can also say look, we`ve done a \u003cbr /\u003ebunch of other things behind the scenes.
 The foreign policy was there \u003cbr /\u003eweeks ago.
 Vice President Biden went down to Central America, did these \u003cbr /\u003emeetings with heads of state in person and on the phone in some cases and \u003cbr /\u003econtinued to press the case, the foreign policy case, that they`ve got to \u003cbr /\u003eget control and help carry this message in every way they can that these \u003cbr /\u003efamilies should not be recruited up here.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe problem with that, it is the problem you see in a lot of asylum cases, \u003cbr /\u003eand there`s a reason why this was original law that created this process \u003cbr /\u003ewas so bipartisan, because there`s a lot of places like Honduras where it \u003cbr /\u003eis so terrible, that no matter how bad that journey is, people still need \u003cbr /\u003eto make it because what they`re facing at home is that terrible.
 And \u003cbr /\u003ethat`s why it was Honduras, it was sex trafficking.
 There was a lot of \u003cbr /\u003eterrible stuff out there that members of Congress said hey, help these \u003cbr /\u003epeople get asylum.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBALL: Yes, and the U.N. in their report on this crisis, when they were \u003cbr /\u003einterviewing children, the children were not saying we came here because it \u003cbr /\u003ewould be easy.
 They said we are leaving because of violence.
 We are \u003cbr /\u003eleaving because we`re afraid we`re going to be killed or raped.
 So that is \u003cbr /\u003ereally the driving force here.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Krystal Ball, Ari Melber and Norma Garcia, thank you all very \u003cbr /\u003emuch.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMELBER: Thank you, Lawrence.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBALL: Thank, Lawrence.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Coming up, Chris Christie vetoes a gun bill because apparently \u003cbr /\u003ehe still believes he can win the Republican Presidential nomination.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd later, Harry Potter and the world cup.
 You`ll have to see what that is \u003cbr /\u003eall about in the spotlight tonight.
 Harry Potter`s back.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: OK. I`m going to confess what is probably the obvious.
 I \u003cbr /\u003edon`t know much about Harry Potter.
 But I have a Harry Potter wizard who \u003cbr /\u003eis going to join me and explain how Harry Potter has come back and kind of \u003cbr /\u003econnected to the world cup.
 That`s coming up.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Yesterday, Chris Christie was forced to defend his decision to \u003cbr /\u003eveto a ten-round limitation on ammunition magazines.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGOV.
 CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY: Mike, I`ve heard the argument.
 And \u003cbr /\u003eso, are we saying that the ten children on the clip that they advocate for, \u003cbr /\u003ethat their lives are less valuable?
 If you take the logical conclusion of \u003cbr /\u003etheir argument, you go to zero, because every life is valuable.
 And so why \u003cbr /\u003eten?
 Why not six?
 Why not two?
 Why not one?
 Why not zero?
 Why not just \u003cbr /\u003eban guns completely?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(END VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Here`s how former Republican politician and admirer of Chris \u003cbr /\u003eChristie Joe Scarborough reacted to that.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST, MORNING JOE: The logic, the ten precious \u003cbr /\u003echildren logic, it`s so convoluted that I don`t think he can say that with \u003cbr /\u003ea straight face.
 I think he would be embarrassed to say that to parents \u003cbr /\u003ewho lost their children.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(END VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Which, of course, is a reasonable explanation of why Chris \u003cbr /\u003eChristie refused to meet with two parents who lost their children in the \u003cbr /\u003emassacre of first graders in Newtown, Connecticut.
 What Chris Christie is \u003cbr /\u003eignoring is the incontrovertible fact that the sooner a mass murderer has \u003cbr /\u003eto reload, the sooner that mass murderer is likely to be stopped.
 That is \u003cbr /\u003eexactly how the mass murder who shot Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and \u003cbr /\u003emurdered six people was stopped.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePATRICIA MAISON, DISARMED TUCSON SHOOTER: The gunman was now down partly \u003cbr /\u003eon top of me, and I saw the colonel and -- I didn`t know who it was then, \u003cbr /\u003eand Roger Salsberg had flattened him.
 He is on his right side.
 I \u003cbr /\u003eimmediately got to my knees and they were shouting, \"grab the gun, grab the \u003cbr /\u003egun.\" And I couldn`t reach the gun because it was in his right hand and \u003cbr /\u003ethat was the distant one from me.
 As they were doing that, he pulled out a \u003cbr /\u003emagazine from his left pocket and had it in his hand but he dropped it on \u003cbr /\u003ethe sidewalk.
 And I was able to recover it before he could get it.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(END VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: This morning on MSNBC, Joe Scarborough identified what he \u003cbr /\u003ethinks is controlling Chris Christie`s position on this issue.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSCARBOROUGH: I think it`s kind of chicken something, which I won`t say on \u003cbr /\u003ethe air.
 There is a second word.
 I mean, the two words, again, it`s \u003cbr /\u003echicken we`ll say salad for Chris Christie to not meet with these families \u003cbr /\u003eat least for five, ten minutes.
 This proves that Chris Christie still \u003cbr /\u003ethinks he can win the Republican nomination for President of the United \u003cbr /\u003eStates.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(END VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Joining me now is David Corn, the Washington bureau chief for \u003cbr /\u003e\"Mother Jones\" and `Washington Post\" columnist Jonathan Capehart.
 Both are \u003cbr /\u003eMSNBC political analysts.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJonathan, what Chris Christie was ignoring when he was rattling off, you \u003cbr /\u003eknow, about five, six, you know, or two or one or no bullets is the \u003cbr /\u003econstitutional limitation.
 The Supreme Court has said clearly there is \u003cbr /\u003eindividual right to bear arms.
 And that Supreme Court does believe there \u003cbr /\u003eis a reasonable limitation on ammunition devices like this.
 And you have \u003cbr /\u003eto pick a number that is within their notion of reasonable and in the past \u003cbr /\u003ethey found nine was the federal law for a very long period of time.
 So \u003cbr /\u003ewhen you`re at ten, you`re going to clearly survive a constitutional \u003cbr /\u003echallenge.
 And if you went down to, you know, four or three or two, as \u003cbr /\u003eChristie was suggesting, there would be absolutely no chance of surviving \u003cbr /\u003ethe constitutional challenge.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJONATHAN CAPEHART, OPINION WRITER, THE WASHINGTON POST: Right.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd I think the key word in your question is reasonable.
 There`s nothing \u003cbr /\u003ereasonable about the Republican primary base.
 I mean, let`s just go under \u003cbr /\u003ethe assumption that the reason why Chris Christie is doing this is because \u003cbr /\u003ehe`s trying to curry favor with potential Republican primary voters for a \u003cbr /\u003epotential 2016 Presidential run.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere`s nothing reasonable about the pro-gun folks within the Republican \u003cbr /\u003eParty who don`t want any kind of restrictions, reasonable or not.
 And so \u003cbr /\u003efor Chris Christie to give that horribly convoluted answer.
 And I have to \u003cbr /\u003eagree with Joe in his description of Governor Christie and his inability or \u003cbr /\u003eunwillingness to meet with those two Newtown parents, I agree with him.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eChris Christie is someone who has made a reputation as being someone who is \u003cbr /\u003enot afraid of a challenge, unafraid to go and take on a challenge, take on \u003cbr /\u003ea problem, you know, head first.
 And in this case, he couldn`t find the \u003cbr /\u003etime, five minutes, ten minutes, to meet with these two -- with these two \u003cbr /\u003efamilies to hear them out.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSenator Cruz was able to do that, why not Governor Christie?
 I think we \u003cbr /\u003eknow the answer to that.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: David Corn, could you imagine there would be a day when Joe \u003cbr /\u003eScarborough and other Republican analysts would look at Chris Christie on \u003cbr /\u003esome issue and say well, he`s just chicken, he`s just afraid of addressing \u003cbr /\u003eit honestly?
 I mean, if Christie had a reputation a year ago, it was well, \u003cbr /\u003eyou know, he`s the straight talking tough guy.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDAVID CORN, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes.
 Well, he is that`s certainly \u003cbr /\u003eout the window now.
 And he can look at the Republican Presidential primary \u003cbr /\u003ehorizon and stretch things out pretty well.
 If he voted for any type of -- \u003cbr /\u003eor if he approved any type of gun control bill, he would be even greater \u003cbr /\u003etoast.
 I don`t know how you go beyond the toast that he is.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Well, that`s the thing, you can`t.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(CROSSTALK)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCORN: It`s quite clear in his mind what he say about the bridgegate and \u003cbr /\u003eeverything else that he still thinks he has a shot.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Yes, he does.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCORN: So anyway, that`s what he`s operating on.
 But I have to say, you \u003cbr /\u003eknow, we talk -- Joe and others have taken on the absurdity of his \u003cbr /\u003eargument, why ten, why not nine?
 Are those lives any more value or less \u003cbr /\u003evalue than the others?
 Or by that same exact reasoning, why not have clips \u003cbr /\u003eof 50 or 100 or 200?
 Because the law is between 10 and 100 are just the \u003cbr /\u003esame.
 I mean, it`s really quite bizarro (ph) and if he ever gets the \u003cbr /\u003eRepublican nomination, which he won`t, this will come back to haunt him.
 \u003cbr /\u003eBut he is a diluted fellow on a lot of friends and we will see how it goes \u003cbr /\u003eon the next six months.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Well, yes.
 Jonathan, that`s a great point, that the Christie \u003cbr /\u003elogic pulled in both directions would allow people to have, you know, \u003cbr /\u003efighter planes.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(CROSSTALK)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Anything they want.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCAPEHART: Yes.
 Here`s what is interesting about what Governor Christie is \u003cbr /\u003edoing besides his arithmetic.
 So he is taking up this position, this very \u003cbr /\u003econservative position on guns to basically, I think mollified the far right \u003cbr /\u003eand the Republican party base over what he`s done on the gay marriage \u003cbr /\u003eangle.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNow, hear me out.
 The courts, the chief judge in the Supreme Court in New \u003cbr /\u003eJersey is the one who legalized same-sex marriage in New Jersey.
 And \u003cbr /\u003eGovernor Christie stepped out there and criticized, blasted this guy.
 And \u003cbr /\u003eI wrote a piece saying, here`s how Governor Christie is going to prove his \u003cbr /\u003erepublican bonafidies (ph), his conservative bonafidies (ph).
 He`s going \u003cbr /\u003eto dump that Supreme Court chief judge because that guy`s tenure would be \u003cbr /\u003eup and he can appoint someone new and show the far right that he`s not \u003cbr /\u003ebeholden to this guy.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, you know what happened?
 That judge is still on the bench.
 That \u003cbr /\u003ejudge was reappointed.
 So this gives -- when conservatives start focusing \u003cbr /\u003ein on Chris Christie and where he is on their issues, on that issue he`s \u003cbr /\u003egoing to fail miserably.
 But when it comes to guns, he`ll just be fine \u003cbr /\u003ebecause he wouldn`t even meet with grieving parents who were killed by gun \u003cbr /\u003eviolence.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCORN: Jonathan, I think you got something there.
 But I also have to say, \u003cbr /\u003eit doesn`t matter what he`s done in gay marriage.
 You know, guns are the, \u003cbr /\u003eyou know, of the three top issues of a lot of people in the Republican \u003cbr /\u003eparty, it`s guns, guns, and more guns.
 And so, what regardless of -- \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCAPEHART: I would say guns, God and gays.
 But go on.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCORN: But I would put guns, guns, guns before you get to God and gays.
 \u003cbr /\u003eBut so, regardless of what he`s done with a judge involved in gay marriage, \u003cbr /\u003ethere is just absolutely no way that he would be competitive at all if he \u003cbr /\u003eapproved any gun control law.
 No matter what he has done in any other \u003cbr /\u003efront.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: He will be as competitive in the Republican nomination race as \u003cbr /\u003ehe would be in the New York marathon.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(CROSSTALK)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: It`s been over since the time he will had his press conference \u003cbr /\u003esaying, you know, I rely completely on my staff.
 You cannot run for high \u003cbr /\u003eoffice saying I rely completely on my staff.
 And by the way, they all \u003cbr /\u003etricked me and betrayed me.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe`re out of time for tonight.
 David Corn and Jonathan Capehart, thank you \u003cbr /\u003eboth for joining me tonight.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCAPEHART: Thanks, Lawrence.
 Good to see you.

 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(END VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: In the spotlight tonight, Harry Potter is back and he has world \u003cbr /\u003ecup fever.
 J.K. Rowling shocked millions of fans across the world today \u003cbr /\u003ewhen she published a new short story on her Web site about Harry Potter, \u003cbr /\u003ethe world`s most famous wizard.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRowling wrote the story as part of an online series about the 2014 world \u003cbr /\u003ecup, the Quidditch (ph) world cup.
 Quidditch (ph) is, of course, the \u003cbr /\u003eofficial sport of the wizarding world.
 In the story, which Rowling wrote, \u003cbr /\u003ein the voice of a fictional gossip columnist, we learn more about the adult \u003cbr /\u003elives Harry and his friends.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJoining me now is host of MSNBC`s \"Ronan Farrow daily\" and Harry Potter \u003cbr /\u003e(INAUDIBLE).
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThank you very much for joining me.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRONAN FARROW, MSNBC HOST, RONAN FARROW DAILY: That is an honoring title.
 \u003cbr /\u003eBut I`m glad to be here.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Everything I know about Harry Potter just passed us by in the \u003cbr /\u003eteleprompter.
 OK, that is it.
 That`s the whole thing.
 And that`s the \u003cbr /\u003emost of Harry Potter movies that I have scene is right there in that \u003cbr /\u003escreen.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: You got the important part.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: And I don`t say that proudly.
 I feel kind of out of it.
 My \u003cbr /\u003estaff, who you know, is -- this was, I lost the vote, and we are doing a \u003cbr /\u003eHarry Potter story.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: This is not the Lawrence passion pick of the night.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Right.
 No.
 But it was unanimous.
 The entire does and you got \u003cbr /\u003eto do this harry Potter thing.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat is the big deal about the author doing a little kind of updating \u003cbr /\u003etoday?
 The excitement on my staff, they couldn`t even speak English words \u003cbr /\u003eabout it they were so thrilled.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: It is remarkable and everywhere I turn, everyone I talked to, \u003cbr /\u003eadults are in that state of frenzy about it.
 And it is partly I think \u003cbr /\u003epeople at that particular age, where you grew up with the character and now \u003cbr /\u003eyou want to see them losing their hair the way you are.
 There`s a \u003cbr /\u003erelatability there.
 And people are just t check in.
 And look, it is \u003cbr /\u003ephenomenon.
 That said, there are people pushing back.
 A new republic call \u003cbr /\u003ethis is a scam.
 There are these super fans that read this and found it was \u003cbr /\u003e1500 words and were incensed about it.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Because they needed another several million words?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: They want more.
 They like the tones, they`re attached to the \u003cbr /\u003echaracters.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Someone is mad because she only wrote 1500 words?
 Would they \u003cbr /\u003erather have zero on Harry today?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: I think the majority of fans are happy.
 I mean, I read it.
 It`s \u003cbr /\u003ecute.
 There`s not a lot to it.
 You do get that play that play of where \u003cbr /\u003ethese characters are.
 And it`s interesting, partly in that there`s a dark \u003cbr /\u003eedge to it because it`s this satire of the gossip --.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Yes.
 He does it in a gossip column voice.
 And this little \u003cbr /\u003ehints in here.
 You know what?
 You should read this instead of me.
 Here \u003cbr /\u003eis one of her excerpts today.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: Time is coming from us all, even Harry.
 The quote is about to \u003cbr /\u003eturn 34.
 There are couple threads of silver and the famous honor (ph) is \u003cbr /\u003eblack hair.
 But he continues to wear the distinctive round glasses that \u003cbr /\u003esome might say are better suited to a style deficient 12-year-old.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: So we know he has some silver hair.
 We know that.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: You really caught on.
 And how old is he now with his silver hair?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: He`s 34.
 Look, I mean, we are all hold on for dear life here, \u003cbr /\u003eLawrence.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: You are going to get there someday.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: You got to find me on you.
 But all are so lucky.
 And he`s orer, \u003cbr /\u003eI don`t know if -- \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: That`s right.
 I had you read that because I don`t know what \u003cbr /\u003ethat word means or how to say it.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: So an orer is the Navy SEAL equivalent, defense against the darks \u003cbr /\u003ecurse.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: OK. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: A very prestigious combative guy now.
 He slips in a little \u003cbr /\u003etantalizing tidbits to keep the fans strung along with you.
 He has got a \u003cbr /\u003ecut on his face.
 We don`t know why.
 She is playing this on -- \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: I have to believe that these books did a lot for literacy in \u003cbr /\u003eAmerica and around the world, because I saw kids carrying these things \u003cbr /\u003earound who were never going to be carrying books around.
 Yes, they were \u003cbr /\u003egoing to be reading some books, but they had to work their way through \u003cbr /\u003emassive novels, which is not something that every 12-year-old kid does.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: Huge.
 And you know, as the books go on, they welcome more \u003cbr /\u003enuanced.
 Look.
 I left those books as an adult, excited fort what she was \u003cbr /\u003egoing to do under her own name or an outs (INAUDIBLE) in the world of adult \u003cbr /\u003eliterature.
 I mean, I think she`s got real skill and artfulness.
 And I \u003cbr /\u003esay, in addition to helping literacy, she overhauled the way authors relate \u003cbr /\u003eto their publishers.
 She took control in a way no one ever has before.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(CROSSTALK)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: You get control.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRonan Farrow.
 The \"Last Word`s`\" senior Harry Potter -- \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: I will take it.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Thank you very much.
 No.
 You know, this is great, because I \u003cbr /\u003ewanted somebody who could explain this to me with enthusiasm, and the first \u003cbr /\u003ecall was Ronan.
 Thank you very much for doing this, Ronan.
 Really \u003cbr /\u003eappreciate it.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYou can watch \"Ronan Farrow Daily\" as I do.
 I wake up to this weekdays at \u003cbr /\u003e1:00 p.m. eastern.
 I wake up about a minute before.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: God bless you.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Coming up, America`s longest running foreign policy mistake \u003cbr /\u003ejust got a little cheaper today.
 That`s on the rewrite.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Ronan, quickly, (INAUDIBLE) our producer of this Harry Potter \u003cbr /\u003esegment insisted that we put her Harry Potter hat, whatever it is, what is \u003cbr /\u003ethat doing here?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: The sorting hat tells you your existential fate, it tells you what \u003cbr /\u003ekind of person you are and where you go in the houses of Harry Potter, \u003cbr /\u003ewhich are modeled after the Oxford Colleges.
 Gryffindor is the one you \u003cbr /\u003ewant.
 You do not want to find out you`re a slithering.
 If you find out \u003cbr /\u003eyou are a slithering, it`s all over.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: So this determines your fate, this thing?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: That`s it.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: OK. Glad we could clear that up.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: I`m not putting it on.
 I don`t want to find out.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: It is the biggest prop we`ve had on this desk.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFARROW: Good one.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Ronan, thank you very much.
 We`ll be back with the rewrite in \u003cbr /\u003ea minute.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: What would you say if the government created a television \u003cbr /\u003enetwork?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, if you`re British, you would probably say the government did a pretty \u003cbr /\u003egood job, the BBC having delivered some brilliant programming, the high \u003cbr /\u003epoints of which are of course Monty Python and David Brend`s (ph) office.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The way that we would -- \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe I should play the hotel manager.

 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
 Go ahead.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello, I wish to make a complaint.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not interested.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED MALE: My room is a disgrace.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don`t care.
 What room are you?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED MALE: 362.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is no 362 in this hotel.
 Sometimes the \u003cbr /\u003ecomplaints will be false.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(END VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: But most government-run television programming around the world \u003cbr /\u003eis quite dreadful.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(VIDEO CLIP PLAYING)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: State-run television tends to be a relentlessly dreary \u003cbr /\u003edeliverer of the current regime`s dreary message.
 And state-run television \u003cbr /\u003eis about as un-American as you can get.
 And so what most of you Americans \u003cbr /\u003ewould say if the United States government tried to create a television \u003cbr /\u003enetwork is, bad idea.
 What the tea party would say is, that`s proof that \u003cbr /\u003ePresident Obama intends to stay in office for the rest of his life, and \u003cbr /\u003eseizing control of television is his first step in suspending Presidential \u003cbr /\u003eelections.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd Republicans would say, that`s absolutely outrageous.
 The government \u003cbr /\u003ehas no right to invade the television business.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut there is a magic word that can get pandering American politicians to \u003cbr /\u003esupport the craziest governing ideas, including the creation of a \u003cbr /\u003etelevision network, and that magic word is -- Cuba.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTwenty four years ago, a Republican President urged the creation of a \u003cbr /\u003egovernment-run television network and Congress gave him what he wanted.
 \u003cbr /\u003eThe network called TV Marti, which was designated to broadcast programs to \u003cbr /\u003eCuba, which would presumably show Cubans how wonderful life is in the \u003cbr /\u003eUnited States.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd instead of putting them to sleep, it would provoke them to, after some \u003cbr /\u003enumber of hours of watching TV, overthrow the Castro regime.
 This didn`t \u003cbr /\u003eseem like such a big step for Republicans at the time, because five years \u003cbr /\u003eearlier, Republican President Ronald Reagan had created a radio Marti, a \u003cbr /\u003eradio network with the same mission of undermining and hopefully \u003cbr /\u003eoverthrowing the Castro regime.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAsk any member of Congress back then whether the American government should \u003cbr /\u003ecreate a radio network or a television network and the answer would be no.
 \u003cbr /\u003eThen ask them if the American government should create a radio or \u003cbr /\u003etelevision network to broadcast in Cuba and a majority said yes.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe successive Republican Presidents and members of Congress who wanted to \u003cbr /\u003edo this were untroubled by the obvious fact at the time that Cuba could \u003cbr /\u003eblock these broadcast signals, because when it comes to the politics of \u003cbr /\u003eCuba policy, a majority of politicians have always been in favor of doing \u003cbr /\u003esomething, anything without the slightest regard to how effective that \u003cbr /\u003esomething might be.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOur 54-year-old embargo of Cuba has been the least effective embargo in \u003cbr /\u003ehistory.
 Instead of leading to the overthrow of the Castro regime, it`s \u003cbr /\u003ealways given the Castro brothers an excuse as to why economic development \u003cbr /\u003ein Cuba is not as strong as it should be and it has done nothing to loosen \u003cbr /\u003ethe regime`s grip on power.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDuring the original congressional debate over TV Marti, supporters like \u003cbr /\u003econgressman (INAUDIBLE), Republican from Florida, herself a Cuban-American, \u003cbr /\u003eargued that even if the broadcasts do not reach any viewers, Castro must \u003cbr /\u003espend valuable money to block the signal.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut blocking that transmission signal is an awful lot cheaper than the \u003cbr /\u003ecreation of hours and hours of television programming and the transmission \u003cbr /\u003eof that signal to Cuba.
 Our government`s best estimates of how many Cubans \u003cbr /\u003eever see TV Marti indicate it`s less than one percent of Cubans.
 An \u003cbr /\u003eabsolutely crazy idea was hatched during George W. Bush`s presidency to \u003cbr /\u003eincrease that viewership.
 It is one of those nutty ideas that would have \u003cbr /\u003ebeen rejected instantly if the word Cuba was not attached to the idea.
 .\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe idea was, aero Marti, an airplane that would try to circumvent Havana`s \u003cbr /\u003ejamming of TV Marti signals by flying around Cuba and dropping TV Marti \u003cbr /\u003esignals from the sky meant to supplement the TV Marti signals already being \u003cbr /\u003ebeamed across a much wider area by direct TV satellites.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe airplane signal cost ten times more than the direct TV signal.
 And \u003cbr /\u003eaccording to the government`s very best estimates again, picked up exactly \u003cbr /\u003eno more viewers.
 Radio Marti and TV Marti are complete and utter failures.
 \u003cbr /\u003eBut in Cuba policy, failing means never having to say you`re sorry, and \u003cbr /\u003enever having to stop doing what is failing.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut aero Marti has taken failure and turned it into disaster, since it \u003cbr /\u003eincreased broadcasting costs dramatically and did not pick up a single \u003cbr /\u003eviewer.
 And so, a small note of sanity has been struck in our Cuba policy \u003cbr /\u003ewith the quiet collapse of aero Marti`s meaningless circling of the \u003cbr /\u003eCaribbean skies.
 After $35 .6 million has been wasted on our airplane in \u003cbr /\u003ethe sky, aero Marti has been grounded without a whimper from its supporters \u003cbr /\u003ewho have been happily wasting this money all these years.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe thing that eventually killed aero Marti was not some brave politician \u003cbr /\u003estanding up against the lunacy of the American government owning and \u003cbr /\u003eoperating a television network and an airplane that was futilely trying to \u003cbr /\u003edeliver the broadcast signal of that network.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat killed our propaganda plane was sequestration.
 Those draconian \u003cbr /\u003espending cuts that have done so much damage in so many sectors of our \u003cbr /\u003egovernment did at least one very good thing, sequestration made funding for \u003cbr /\u003ethe propaganda plane`s fuel and pilots disappear.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut TV Marti and radio Marti have survived sequestration, and although \u003cbr /\u003eradio Marti and TV Marti have spent more than $500 million to reach less \u003cbr /\u003ethan one percent to have Cuban population and as far as we can tell, change \u003cbr /\u003etheir minds about nothing.
 No politician who seriously aspires to the \u003cbr /\u003epresident who will dare to say a word about this wasted $500 million, \u003cbr /\u003ebecause when it comes to Cuba policy, the American governor is still crazy \u003cbr /\u003eafter all these years.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: It is almost 11:00 p.m. eastern.
 Do you know where your \u003cbr /\u003ePresident is?
 He`s shooting pool and drinking beer with the governor of \u003cbr /\u003eColorado in Colorado.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Monday of next week is Malala day, a day that honors Malala \u003cbr /\u003eYousafzai as they did the honors the 17th birthday.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a story of strength.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Once there was a girl who wanted to go to school.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But there were those who did not want her to learn.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They were afraid education would give her power.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But the girl did not let this stop her.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She dreamed of learning.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was not alone.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Weakness, fear and helplessness died, strength, power \u003cbr /\u003eand courage was born.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was determined.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was stronger than violence.
 She was stronger \u003cbr /\u003ethan oppression.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was stronger than fear.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What are you stronger than?
 Show it to the world on \u003cbr /\u003ethis Malala day.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e(END VIDEO CLIP)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Malala.org is adding spurs of Malala to share their photos and \u003cbr /\u003emessages using #stronger than to raise awareness for girls and boys \u003cbr /\u003eeducation.
 And nearly two dozen nonprofit groups will announce their own \u003cbr /\u003einitiatives including the Malala fund.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJoining me now is Shiza Shahid.
 She is the CEO and co-founder of the \u003cbr /\u003eMalala fund, which helps empower women around the world.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eShiza, what is this Malala fund doing?
 What are the main programs you are \u003cbr /\u003edoing?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSHIZA SHAHID, CEO, MALALA FUND: Well, the Malal fund is co-founded by \u003cbr /\u003emyself, Malala and her father.
 And it was really out of our desire to say, \u003cbr /\u003eyes, Malala was shot.
 Yes, she survived and that is a moment of hope.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHowever, there are millions across the world are denied an education.
 And \u003cbr /\u003eMalala`s attack and her survival should not just be a moment, but a \u003cbr /\u003emovement that changes the faith of girls in the most difficult \u003cbr /\u003ecircumstances in the world.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe are currently working in four countries, Pakistan, Jordan, Kenya and \u003cbr /\u003esoon Nigeria.
 There we do grant making.
 And in addition, we do advocacy, \u003cbr /\u003eusing Malala`s voice and amplifying the voices of other girls to try and \u003cbr /\u003ebring change globally on this issue.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Talk about this extraordinary 17-year-old.
 This is the kind of \u003cbr /\u003eperson that the world sees once every 50 years, just truly extraordinary.
 \u003cbr /\u003eIt`s hard to think of an example of someone who has had this kind of \u003cbr /\u003eworldwide impact by the age of 17.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSHAHID: She is truly remarkable.
 She has the bravery of no one we have \u003cbr /\u003eever seen before, to go through what she did and wake up and say, you know \u003cbr /\u003ewhat, I`m not done, and I`m going to be louder and stronger than ever \u003cbr /\u003ebefore, is something that is truly magical and gives us hope that there is \u003cbr /\u003ea better tomorrow for all of those girls suffering unspeakable things \u003cbr /\u003etoday.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: What kind of protection that she had not?
 Surely the people \u003cbr /\u003ethat tried to kill her before very much still want to kill her.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSHAHID: Well, Malala is, and without exaggeration, the bravest girl and \u003cbr /\u003ethe world.
 And as she says, before that date, I was a little bit afraid.
 \u003cbr /\u003eNow I know that even death does not want to stop my mission.
 And so, she \u003cbr /\u003eis moving forward.
 She is in school.
 She is spending her time on the \u003cbr /\u003eground working for the projects of the Malala fund.
 She is raising her \u003cbr /\u003evoice and traveling to the developing world, to some of the toughest places \u003cbr /\u003eon Malala day.
 And we believe that death is on her side.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: How does her father feel about this?
 I mean, you know, her \u003cbr /\u003efather almost lost his daughter.
 And one way to deal with this would to be \u003cbr /\u003eto simply maybe move to England or the United States or somewhere safer and \u003cbr /\u003estay out of sight an just protect your life.
 And yet, that is not a choice \u003cbr /\u003eshe is making, and he is supporting her in this choice.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSHAHID: Her father is a revolutionary.
 He has been one since he was very \u003cbr /\u003eyoung and is very much the person who inspired Malala and continues to lift \u003cbr /\u003eher up.
 He says, what I did to help empower Malala was that I did not cut \u003cbr /\u003eher wings.
 And that is his approach with her.
 He knows she is very \u003cbr /\u003especial.
 And they have made a choice that their mission is more important \u003cbr /\u003ethan their lives.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: And listen.
 Their feeling that if Malala did retreat and \u003cbr /\u003ebasically go into hiding for her own safety, that would be a form of \u003cbr /\u003evictory for her opponents and for the people who want her dead?
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSHAHID: I just think that they have always seen their lives as meant for a \u003cbr /\u003epurpose, and that purpose is so much bigger than the fear for their own \u003cbr /\u003esafety.
 They are incredibly spiritual, they are incredibly cause and \u003cbr /\u003epassion driven.
 And they just cannot imagine a life without themselves \u003cbr /\u003ebeing dedicated to the greater good.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: And we talked a great deal on this program and Malala, \u003cbr /\u003eobviously, about girls` education.
 But there is a boys` component to this \u003cbr /\u003etoo.
 We need to get the boys educated out of growing up into this attitude \u003cbr /\u003eof being threatened by girls` education.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSHAHID: Definitely.
 And if you, educated girls, and you have the man of \u003cbr /\u003ethe community against that, you are putting that girl at risk.
 So \u003cbr /\u003eeducation interventions and girls` and women`s interventions must very much \u003cbr /\u003eengage the community while also and empowering that women.
 Because \u003cbr /\u003eultimately, it`s those men who are their fathers, their brothers and their \u003cbr /\u003ehusbands.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eO`DONNELL: Shiza Shahid gets tonight`s \"Last Word.\" And there is just no \u003cbr /\u003ebetter good news story than we could do than Malala is striving and is 17 \u003cbr /\u003eand facing a happy birthday coming up.
 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThank you, Shiza, very much.
