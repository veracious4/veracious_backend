It is important to note that national and internat
ional data can differ because international agencies 
standardize national data to allow comparability across countries and in some cases may not have access 
to the most recent national data.

Country coverage and the methodology of the 2019 Human Developme
nt Report
 
 
The 2019 Human Development Report presents the 2018 HDI (values and ranks) for 189 countries and 
UN
-
recognized territories, along with the IHDI for 150 countries, the GDI for 166 countries, the GII for 162 
countries, and the MPI for 101 
countries.
 
 
It is 
misleading
 
to compare values and rankings with those of previously published reports, because of 
revisions and updates of the underlying data and adjustments to goalposts. Readers are advised to assess 
progress in HDI values by referring 

Development Report. Table 2 is based on consistent indicators, methodology and time
-
series data and, 
thus, shows 
real changes
 
in values and ranks over time, reflecting the actual progress coun
tries have made. 
Small changes in values should be interpreted with caution as they may not be statistically significant due 
to sampling variation. Generally speaking, changes at the level of the third decimal place in any of the 
composite indices are cons
idered insignificant.
 
 
Unless otherwise specified in the source, tables use data available to the Human Development Report 
Office (HDRO) 
as of 15 July 2019. All indices and indicators, along with technical notes on the calculation 
of composite indices, and
 
additional source information are available online at 
http://hdr.undp.org/en/data

Human Development Index (HDI)
 
 
The HDI is a summary measure for assessing long
-
term progress in three basic dimensions of human 
development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living. A long and 
healthy life is measured by life expectancy. Knowledge le
vel is measured by mean years of schooling 
among the adult population, which is the average number of years of schooling received in a life
-
time by 
people aged 25 years and older; and access to learning and knowledge by expected years of schooling for 
chil
dren of school
-
entry age, which is the total number of years of schooling a child of school
-
entry age can 
expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age
-
specific enrolment rates stay the same throughout the child's 
life. Standard of living is measured by 
Gross National Income (GNI) per capita expressed in constant 2011 
international dollars converted using purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates. For more details see 
Technical Note 1
.
 
 
To ensure as much cross
-
country comparability as possible, the HDI is based primarily on international 
data from the United Nations Population Division (the life expectancy data), the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural 
Organization Institute for Statistics (the mean years of schooling and expected years 
of schooling data) and the World Bank (the GNI per capita data). As stated in the introduction, the HDI 

 
in past reports because of some revisions 
to the component indicators. To allow for assessment of progress in HDIs, the 2019 Human Development 
Report includes recalculated HDIs from 1990 to 2018 using consistent series of data.

Inequality
-
adjusted HDI (IHDI)
 
 
The HDI is an average measure of basic human development achievements in a country. Like all averages, 
the HDI masks inequality in the distribution of human development across the population at the country 
level. The 
2010 HDR introduced the IHDI, which takes into account inequality in all three dimensions of the 
HDI
 

 
The IHDI is 
basically the HDI discounted for inequalities.
 

 
in human development due to inequality is given by 
the difference between the HDI and the IHDI, and can be expressed as a percentage. As the inequality in 
a country increases, the loss in human development also increases. We also present the coefficient o
f 
human inequality as a direct measure of inequality which is an unweighted average of inequalities in three 
dimensions. The IHDI is calculated for 150 countries. 
For more details see 
Technical Note 2
.

. However, when the value is discounted for inequality, the HDI falls to 
0.264
, a loss of 
36.1
 
percent due to inequality in the distribution of the HDI dimension indices. 
Benin
 
and 
Lesotho
 
show losses due to inequality of 
37.1
 
percent and 
32.5
 
percent respectively. The average loss due 
to inequality for 
low
 
HDI countries is 
31.1
 
percent and for 
Sub

it is

Gender Development Index (GDI)
 
 
In the 2014 HDR, HDRO introduced a new measure, the GDI, based on the sex
-
disaggregated Human 
Development Index, defined as a ratio of the female to the male HDI. The GDI measures gender inequalities 
in achievement in three basic dimensions of human develo
pment: health (measured by female and male 
life expectancy at birth), education (measured by female and male expected years of schooling for children 
and mean years for adults aged 25 years and older) and command over economic resources (measured 
by female
 
and male estimated GNI per capita). For details on how the index is constructed refer to 
Technical 
Note 3
. Country groups are based on absolute deviation from gender parit
y in HDI. This means that the 
grouping takes into consideration inequality in favour of men or women equally.
 
The GDI is calculated for 166 countries. The 2018 female HDI value for 
South Sudan
 
is 
0.369
 
in contrast 
with 
0.440
 
for males, resulting in a GDI value of 
0.839
, placing it in
to Group 
5
. In comparison, GDI values 
for 
Benin
 
and 
Lesotho
 
are
 
0.883
 
and 
1.026
 
respectively
 
(see Table D).

Gender Inequality Index (GII)
 
 
The 2010 HDR introduced the GII, which reflects gender
-
based inequalities in three dimensions 

 
reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity. Reproductive health is measured by maternal 
mortality and adolescent birth rates; empowerment is measur
ed by the share of parliamentary seats held 
by women and attainment in secondary and higher education by each gender; and economic activity is 
measured by the labour market participation rate for women and men. The GII can be interpreted as the 
loss in hum
an development due to inequality between female and male achievements in the three GII 
dimensions. For more details on GII please see 
Technical Note 4
.
 
Due to a lack of rel
evant data, the GII 
has not been calculated for this country.

Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)
 
 
The 2010 HDR introduced the MPI, which 
identifies multiple overlapping deprivations suffered by individuals 
in 3 dimensions: health, education and standar
d of living. The health and education dimensions are based 
on two indicators each, while standard of living is based on six indicators. All the indicators needed to 
construct the MPI for a country are taken from the same household survey. The indicators ar
e weighted to 
create a deprivation score, and the deprivation scores are computed for each individual in the survey. 
A 
deprivation score of 33.3 percent (one
-
third of the weighted indicators) is used to distinguish between the 
poor and nonpoor. If 
the deprivation 
score is 33.3 percent or greater, the household (and everyone in it) is 
classified as multidimensionally poor. Individuals with a deprivation score greater than or equal to 20 
percent but less than 33.3 percent are classified as vulnerable 
to multidimensional poverty.
 
Finally, 
individuals with a deprivation score greater than or equal to 50 percent live in severe multidimensional 
poverty. The MPI is calculated for 101 developing countries in the 2019 HDR. Definitions of deprivations in 
each 
indicator, as well as methodology of the MPI are given in 
Technical Note 5
.
 
 
The most recent survey data that were publicly available for 
South Sudan

 
MPI estimation refer
 
to 
2010
. 
In 
South Sudan
,
 
91.9
 
percent of the population (
11,552
 
thousand people) are multidimensionally poor while 
an additional 
6.3
 
percent are classified as vulnerable to multidimensional poverty (
797
 
thousand people). 
The breadth of deprivation (intens
ity) in 
South Sudan
, which is the average deprivation score experienced 
by people in multidimensional poverty, is 
63.2
 
percent. The MPI, which is the share of the population that is 
multidimensionally poor, adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations, is 
0.580
. 
Benin
 
and 
Lesotho
 
have 
MPIs of 
0.368
 
and 
0.146
 
respectively
.
 
 
Table F compares multidimensional poverty with i
ncome poverty, measured by the percentage of the 
population living below PPP US$1.90 per day. It shows that income poverty only tells part of the story.  The 
multidimensional poverty headcount is 
49.2
 
percentage points 
higher
 
than income poverty. 
This impl
ies that 
individuals living 
above the income poverty line may still suffer deprivations in health, education and/or 
satandard 
of living.
 
Table F also shows the percentage of 
South Sudan

multidimensional poverty. 
The contri
butions of deprivations in each dimension to overall poverty complete 
a comprehensive picture of people living in multidimensional poverty in 
South Sudan

Countries are grouped partially by their performance in each indicator into three groups of approximately 
equal size (terciles), thus, there is the top third, the middle third and the bottom third. The 
intention is not to

colour coding visualizes a partial grouping of countries by indicator. 
It can be seen as a s

performance. A country that is in the top group performs better than at least two thirds of countries (i.e., it 
is among the top third performers); a country that is in the
 
middle group performs better than at least one 
third but worse than at least one third (i.e., it is among the medium third performers); and a country that is

Dashboard 1: Quality of human development
 
This dashboard contains a selection of 14 indicators associated with the quality of health, education and 
standard of living. The indicators on quality of health are lost health expectancy, number of physicians, and 
number of hospital beds. The indicators 
on quality of education are pupil
-
teacher ratio in primary schools, 
primary school teachers trained to teach, percentage of primary (secondary) schools with access to the 
internet, and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores in mat
hematics, reading 
and science. The indicators on quality of standard of living are the proportion of employed people engaged 
in vulnerable employment, the proportion of rural population with access to electricity, the proportion of 
population using improve
d drinking water sources, and proportion of population using improved sanitation 
facilities. 
 
A country that is in the top third group on all indicators can be considered a country with the highest quality 
of human development. The dashboard shows that not
 
all countries in the very high human development 
group have the highest quality of human development and that many countries in the low human 
development group are in the bottom third of all quality indicators in the table.
 
Table G provides the number of 
indicators in which 
South Sudan

This dashboard contains a selection of 12 key indicators that display gender gaps in choices and 
opportunities over the life course 

 
childhood and youth, adulthood and older age. The indicators refer to 
education, labour market and 
work, political representation, time use, and social protection. Three indicators 
are presented only for women and the rest are given in the form of female
-
to
-
male ratio. Countries are 
grouped partially by their performance in each indicator into three gro
ups of approximately equal size 
(terciles). Sex ratio at birth is an exception 
-
 
countries are grouped into two groups: the natural group 
(countries with a value of 1.04
-
1.07, inclusive) and the gender
-
biased group (countries with all other values). 
Deviat
ions from the natural sex ratio at birth have implications for population replacement levels, suggest 
possible future social and economic problems and may indicate gender bias.

Dashboard 4: Environmental sustainability 
 
This dashboard contains a selection of 11 indicators that cover environmental sustainability and 
environmental threats. The environmental sustainability indicators present levels of or changes in energy 
consumption, carbon
-
dioxide emissions, change in fore
st area, fresh water withdrawals, and natural 
resource depletion. The environmental threats indicators are mortality rates attributed to household and 
ambient air pollution, and to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene services, percentage of land that is 
d
egraded, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Index value, which measures 
change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species. The percentage of total land area under forest 
is not coloured because it is meant to provide
 
context for the indicator on change in forest area.

South Sudan
 
performs: better than at least two thirds of

Dashboard 5: 
Socioeconomic sustainability
 
This dashboard contains a selection of 11 indicators that cover economic and social sustainability. The 
economic sustainability indicators are adjusted net savings, total debt service, gross capital formation, 
skilled labour fo
rce, diversity of exports, and expenditure on research and development. The social 
sustainability indicators are old age dependency ratio projected to 2030, the ratio of the sum of education 
and health expenditure to military expenditure, changes in inequa
lity of HDI distribution, and changes in 
gender and income inequality. Military expenditure is not coloured because it is meant to provide context 
for the indicator on education and health expenditure and it is not directly considered as an indicator of 
so
cioeconomic sustainability.
