 Vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking.
 Here we report a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 (and SARS-CoV).
 This cross-neutralizing antibody targets a communal epitope on these viruses and offers potential for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.Footnotes↵** These authors are joint first authors.↵$ These authors are joint senior authors.
