Skip to content        THE DAILY ROUND Living From the Spirit Level           In the Time of¬†Pandemic   Kitty   Spirit Level   March 16, 2020May 13, 2020     And the people stayed home.
 And they listened, and read books, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still.
 And they listened more deeply.
 Some meditated, some prayed, some danced.
 Some met their shadows.
 And the people began to think differently.
 And the people healed.
 And, in the absence of people living in ignorant, dangerous, and heartless ways, the earth began to heal.
 And when the danger passed, and the people joined together again, they grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images, and created new ways to live and heal the earth fully, as they had been healed.

 Would love to include your post in full at the end.
 Not sure when it‚Äôs finished.
 Mom was just diagnosed with cancer amidst all this, soooo‚Ä¶.we are trying to ensure she gets care in a timely fashion before it metastasizes.
 Thank you for writing such a succinct vision and making it in the past tense, and clearly touching on the hopes of so many.
 We have so much work to do to get there‚Ä¶we have no choice, though, do we?
 Reply        Kitty says:     								March 18, 2020 at 7:34 AM							     Oh, Ethan; first, I am so sorry your family is dealing with this new terror in the midst of a healthcare crisis.
 I worked with the best in that field and I know how hard they are trying to spread their gifts.
 You mother‚Äôs care and healing are now carried in my heart, and please, if time allows, let me know how it‚Äôs going for you all.
 Your essay sounds intriguing and hopeful; I would so enjoy reading it when you have completed it.
 Yes, please use the quote, if you like.
 We still have many choices, dear one.
 Writing that essay is one of them, and being the loving son who is choosing to accompany his mother on this journey is another.
 But, yes, now is the acceptable time to face the world and love her back into health and sustainability.
 I hope we don‚Äôt squander it.
 Be well, gentle peace.

 It is magical and spot on.

 Reply          Lorna McNeur says:     								April 11, 2020 at 9:46 AM							     Dear Kitty,  Once Upon a Planet  In a Far Away Time This fairy tale came through me about Climate Change and Covid Crisis including the Hope that is already Shining for our Future I would Love to include your poem inside the fairy tale and I wonder if you might be able to have a read and let me know if I may include your poem ‚ÄúAnd the People Stayed Home‚Äù At the moment, the fairy tale is posted on our Cambridge Jungian Circle website https://www.cambridgejungiancircle.com/noticeboard-creativity I have mentioned your poem, your name, and website link in the fairy tale I would love to include all of this, and add your poem as well, with your permission I look forward to hearing from you Warmest Wishes to All and Stay Safe, Lorna McNeur  Reply        Kitty says:     								April 11, 2020 at 11:34 AM							     I‚Äôm not sure I understand clearly, Lorna; I didn‚Äôt see my poem or info on this page, but I did read your own creative fairy tale and think its messages are inspiring indeed, and don‚Äôt require my words‚Äô intrusion.
 Because the poem is copyrighted and under contract with a children‚Äôs book publisher, it‚Äôs best it not be merged with other writing, but I have certainly allowed people to share it, properly titled and credited, in newsletters , etc., where commercialization is not intended.
 I hope this helps; please let me know if I can help further.
 Stay safe and well, Lorna.
 Gentle peace.
 Reply        Lorna McNeur says:     								April 11, 2020 at 12:02 PM							     Many thanks for your swift response Kitty,  At the moment I only include your name, poem title, and website link in the fairy tale (see image of text below) But I would Love to include your whole poem too, properly titled and credited  I did not want to include your poem until you gave me permission but it flows so much more beautifully with your actual words in there too  Our website is not at all commercial We are a charity and we are all volunteers We simply share for Healing and Growing  Below is the last part of the fairy tale where your details are mentioned (highlighted in red now for you to see quickly, but not in the actual text)  The red text is where I want to include your poem and credits, if possible ?
 Stay Safe and Well Kitty,  Warm Wishes,  Lorna  A poem within a fairy tale is such a lovely thing  &gt;  Reply        Lorna McNeur says:     								April 11, 2020 at 12:49 PM							     Sorry Kitty,  It might be clearer if I show you how I would like to include your poem in the fairy tale  Below is how I would like to include it with your permission of course üôÇ  Warmest Wishes,  Lorna  &gt;  Reply        Kitty says:     								April 11, 2020 at 1:39 PM							     Hi, Lorna, I‚Äôd rather my poem not be included within your fairy tale, but if you want to post it separately, that‚Äôs fine, with the accurate title and credit.
 While it reads as a fable, I‚Äôd rather it not be confused with a ‚Äúfairy tale,‚Äù as I firmly believe change is not only possible but utterly necessary for our welfare and survival, and I think many people hear the words, ‚Äúfairy tale‚Äù and immediately use the words to disassociate from a reality connected to their own.
 I realize Jung understood the truth and value of myths, symbol, and fairy tales, but I‚Äôd rather not have my poem pulled into that context before people have a chance to hear the invitations and act on them.
 I hope this helps explain my thinking, and forgive me if I have not made myself clear.
 We are in the midst of our Triduum practices this weekend, and I‚Äôm unable to share more at this time.
 Bless your wonderful creativity and keep tending it.
 With love, Kitty         Lorna McNeur says:     								April 11, 2020 at 1:49 PM							     Lovely,  Many thanks Kitty.
 I understand your words And will post your poem separately from my fairy tale But it will be lovely To include it on our page  Crisis &amp; Creativity Climate Change &amp; Covid  Blessings and Love, Lorna  &gt;               Caroline O'meara says:     								April 25, 2020 at 10:49 AM							     kitty loved your poem i am from janesville wisconsin and my husbands uncle lived in madison wis. seeing there are not to many omeras around was wondering if walter was your dad.

 No, my father was Charles, and his family settled near Stevens Point Wisconsin, and then Minnesota.
 I suppose we‚Äôd be related if we went back far enough, though; Ireland isn‚Äôt that large.

 I‚Äôve been following the responses to Kitty‚Äôs Spirit led offering of hope, In the Time of Pandemic, that seems to be circling the globe.
 There has been much discussion about authenticity and historic confusion about writers with the same name.
 I think if you look back through the thread of responses you will find answers to any concerns about authorship.
 I don‚Äôt know Kitty, but her work and her comments to her readers show me the blessings of Spirit coming through loud and clear.
 Light and love to all in these challenging days.
 Reply        Kitty says:     								March 20, 2020 at 2:28 PM							     Thank you, Janet.
 And yes, light and love to all of us human beings being human.
 üôÇ  Reply          Kitty says:     								March 20, 2020 at 2:26 PM							     Lorraine, I have done this, many times and in many places this past week.
 I would encourage you, rather than visiting my site with further accusations, to actually source and read the other poem, and, if you are familiar with poetry, you‚Äôll see they are not at all alike.
 An important part of healing is to do the work for ourselves.
 This is my poem, and my site, and I won‚Äôt allow toxic energy to harm the sweet and kind people who visit with me here.
 All are invited, but kindness has to prevail.
 Why anyone would assume things about me without knowing me, or do that to anyone else, seems to speak to a need better directed and met inward before sharing it.
 I wish you peace, and that you be safe and well in this time of illness.
 Reply        Dhyan says:     								March 23, 2020 at 10:11 AM							     You, Loraine, should put forward the ‚Äúitalian quote‚Äù.. better yet, should have checked carefully and understand an eventual inspiration from a plagiarism.
 Reply        ethan says:     								April 10, 2020 at 1:22 AM							     Hi Kitty, My mother is recovering rapidly and has a pretty good prognosis!
 We have so much to feel grateful for‚Ä¶ I am working diligently on the piece I mentioned!
 it is rapidly turning into a book about evolutionary human ecology.
 I have been writing pieces of it (actually in the context of separate book projects) for about 5 years, and I just didn‚Äôt know it!
 I do have a draft outline finished if you‚Äôd like to see it, let me know.
 Steadily organizing the content I have written into the outline format‚Ä¶ Hope you are doing OK and getting good self-care and space amidst this piece blowing up!
 I saw that you had to file a DMCA claim.
 ‚ÄúBut, yes, now is the acceptable time to face the world and love her back into health and sustainability.
 I hope we don‚Äôt squander it.‚Äù Yes, this a thousand times this!
 Thank you!
 cheers ethan  Reply        Kitty says:     								April 10, 2020 at 8:44 AM							     Oh, Ethan, such wonderful news regarding your mother!
 Please know I hold her continued healing in my heart.
 And how glorious for your own work in the world that you‚Äôve made progress and perceived connections that are allowing you to cohere years of work!
 I can‚Äôt wait to see it, whenever you are ready to share.
 It sounds like a work we need (probably 30 years ago) rather desperately in these times.
 I hope you are finding joy in the important creating you‚Äôre doing.
 Hooray for you!!!
 Yes, there has also been a learning curve for me in all of this, not all of it joyful, but, in fairness, overwhelmingly so, and I am still/always most grateful for the many, many connections that have been made between my words and the loveliest people in our world‚Ä¶and there are millions.
 Please keep in touch when you are able, Ethan.
 Stay well and safe, and great gentle peace.

 I‚Äôve seen it shared over and over these past days on social media.
 Thankfully, so far always with your name attached.
 Being a writer and a former reporter, I just had to find the author!
 Do you have any other social media accounts?
 I‚Äôd love to be able to direct people to you in sharing it.
 Thank you again and be well!

 You‚Äôll probably laugh, but I have this blog for sharing my writing, and my Facebook account that I keep private.
 I still need someone to spend a few minutes with me and help me learn to navigate Twitter and Instagram, but to be honest, I like to keep most of my time for my husband and 4-leggeds, reading, and long walks.
 I don‚Äôt feel comfortable always being connected to ‚Äúmedia,‚Äù and losing connection with my spirit and thoughts.
 Bless you, and be well and safe.

 Reply        Kitty says:     								March 18, 2020 at 7:40 AM							     Wow, Teresa, you‚Äôre so right about all the sorrows heaped on your beautiful home over these many months.
 Such tragic losses.
 I so hope this time of relative stillness (for many of us) allows us to truly see what we‚Äôve done to the earth and to be aware that she‚Äôs in triage, too.
 This is such an opportunity for healing.
 You take care!
 Thank you for your kind words and be well, Teresa.

 Reply              Valerie Boatwright says:     								March 17, 2020 at 8:15 PM							     Your words have gone viral, literally overnight.
 The first time I read them, they made my heart pound!
 I thought I was the only one who felt, strangely, somewhat comforted and content staying home during this time of uncertainty.
 Thank you for your beautiful words.
 Reply        Kitty says:     								March 18, 2020 at 8:05 AM							     You know, Valerie, I saw the maps that showed such great reduction in the pollution over China, and then the clearing moved over Europe; I hope it‚Äôs happening here in my country, too‚Ä¶and I thought what good could come from a time of such suffering.
 Then, the Spirit knocked me upside the head and I cobbled out the poem and it kind of spun out of my control‚Ä¶another opportunity for self-awareness!
 I am so blessedly happy the small words have touched hearts and soothed.
 Gentle peace to you, and be well.

 My love for the earth is my passion, and if we can allow her to heal and change how we live with her, it would be the best gift we ever gave ourselves.

 I am an admirer of this beautiful verse that you wrote and posted on your blog today but did you know that it has been exploding all over Facebook today?
 People are wondering where the verse came from and who the author is.
 Just to let people know, you may want to release a statement about the source of the verse to give yourself credit.
 There are many misleading things going around on social media right now so knowing the true source of your words would be reassuring to many I‚Äôm sure.
 Thank you for such uplifting words!
 Reply        Kitty says:     								March 16, 2020 at 5:05 PM							     Yes, encountered some craziness on Deepak Chopra‚Äôs site, and I really just want to let it go.
 I wrote it and posted it on my little, personal Facebook page last Friday, and off it went: out of my control.
 I am so glad it touched your heart.
 Thank you for taking time to write me.
 Reply        Lydia says:     								March 17, 2020 at 1:43 PM							     Thank you so much for this!

 Is that you?
 If so, there was apparently another Kitty O‚ÄôMeara from the 1800‚Äôs that people are assuming wrote it  Reply        Kitty says:     								March 17, 2020 at 6:03 PM							     Yes, it is mine.
 I‚Äôm not from the 1800‚Äôs.
 I was struck by the way pollution was clearing over China, then Europe as quarantine set in, and I thought we could all both use this time for healing and heal the earth together.
 My work as a writer, spiritual director and chaplain influences my writing.

 It‚Äôs a beautiful piece and I, too, would like to see you credited.
 I have a young South African friend who was isolated in Haikou for about 2 months (Dec/Feb).
 When I asked her how she was coping, she said that she actually enjoyed having the time to be creative‚Ä¶she wrote poetry, did yoga, danced, learned how to play the drums, learned how to do the dragon dance (with ribbons), experimented with cooking vegan dishes.
 To her also, it was a gift.
 Thanks again.

 Your blog is lovely, I see you hadn‚Äôt written for sometime, I encourage you take it up again, you have a gift to share, you and your muse obviously have touched many people.
 This piece has the quality of a fable, a biblical story, and hopefully, if enough people read it, as an affirmation of possibilities.

 I was feeling so frustrated and blue that my friends in healthcare are struggling so desparately, and I‚Äôm now at home, seemingly doing nothing to help anyone.
 My husband told me to start writing.
 It‚Äôs funny, when you have a gift, even a small one, it comes naturally and you don‚Äôt often see that it‚Äôs truly a gift (and gifts are for giving away), so I wrote this and posted it on my small and personal facebook page, and one friend shared it‚Ä¶Lesson learned, again: Name and know and use your gifts.

 They echoed deeply in me, as with so many others.
 They give a voice to what we know is so urgently needed, but felt powerless to do, caught in the devouring relentless mechanic of our lives.
 Slow down, stop, become more conscious, heal‚Ä¶ We have know for some time that we have to do it but be believed it was impossible.
 And here we are.
 So a heartfelt gratitude for your words.
 I am discovering your blog but already I feel you have a beautiful heart.
 One thought came to my mind‚Ä¶ Perhaps could I translate this message into French?

 What‚Äôs an audience?‚Äù I‚Äôve written for years, and quit the blog a couple years ago, because I thought I was just writing notes to myself and close friends.
 Seeing my sadness with the pandemic‚Äôs horror upon us, my husband urged me to start writing again.
 The point is to write what I‚Äôm thinking and feeling and believe, and not to worry how it sails when I cast it off‚Ä¶Exactly what I would have said to everyone I‚Äôve ever taught, counseled, loved.
 And he was right.
 Using our gifts, however small, heals US, and that healing heals others.
 Or not.
 But be and do what you‚Äôre here to be and do, anyway.
 You sound exactly like someone I would welcome as a reader.
 Nope, I‚Äôm not a ghost, yet; I‚Äôm just an average person who tries and fails, gives up, and then is encouraged by another loving human to try again.

 Your words were suddenly all over my feed this morning and I was wondering if I might get in touch with you about the rapid spread of this quote of yours.

 I‚Äôm writing you because your work here has suddenly exploded in popularity and I‚Äôve seen it crop up in multiple places.
 I was wondering if I might be able to arrange a phone interview with you to discuss its rapid spread and also to get a picture of who you are.

 You didn‚Äôt see it before that.
 A friend asked to re-post it that night.
 It went viral over the weekend, and many interesting and some unpleasant things have since occurred.
 My darling husband urged me to start up the blog again because he ‚Äúloves my writing,‚Äù and we thought it might be a good way to do something positive while we‚Äôre quarantined at home, so I began with this piece.
 I‚Äôm so touched that it spoke to so many hearts.
 I hope it also inspires people to create using their gifts as well.
 We need to change how we‚Äôre being with each other and to the earth.

 Actually, right now I‚Äôm re-reading Camus‚Äô The Plague, but I think The Decameron would be a good follow-up.
 It‚Äôs helpful to recall times like the Black Death have been endured by humanity before, and to read their responses, and refresh our hope that life will go on, possibly in more loving, and wiser ways.

 I think you‚Äôre already aware that it‚Äôs going worldiwide viral with most of the people who are sharing it that don‚Äôt even know who‚Äôs the author.
 I‚Äôve read stuff like ‚ÄúCatheleen O‚ÄôMeara, written during the 1800 plague‚Äù üòÄ In my small way, I shared it on my facebook page an italian traslated version linking to the original version on your blog.
 Thaks again  Reply        Kitty says:     								March 19, 2020 at 9:18 AM							     Thank you for your kindness, Fulvio.
 I am so moved by the bravery and suffering in your country and send my prayers to all.
 It‚Äôs natural to seek out an artist who touches us, and when it travels to us virally, as it can these days, and is by an unknown artist, which most of us are, then there will be confusion.
 The focus should be on the feelings we‚Äôre feeling, and on our healing and transformation.
 Please take care of your precious life and of those you love.
 Now, you‚Äôre in my heart and prayers, too.
 Be well.
 Reply          Kitty says:     								March 19, 2020 at 9:10 AM							     I wrote it and posted it last week, on my Facebook page.

 I was so profoundly moved that I had to read it again and again, and felt the need to share it with most people I connected with since I first read it (I‚Äôm not quite used to do this kind of things‚Ä¶).
 Still trying to understand why it moved me so much.
 I feel this is exactly what‚Äôs going through my mind these days.
 Thank you!
 There was also an image I received at the same moment, which I quite liked.
 Was that also coming from you?
 If fine for you, I‚Äôd like to put your postt in my blog, with your credits obviously.
 This also was the opportunity to discover your blog and so profound thoughts, which I really identify with, that I need to come back again for a deeper review.
 Thanks again for sharing all this in your blog over the years.
 Thank you!
 Reply        Kitty says:     								March 19, 2020 at 12:56 PM							     HI, Laurent, I think we‚Äôre all trying to understand many things as we walk into this mystery place and, maybe, we have to set down those deeply human needs to organize, and label, and know what‚Äôs coming next, and just be with the people, 4-leggeds, tasks, and healthy methods of self-care right before us.
 It‚Äôs important to take moments of calm, peace, and rest when we ‚Äòre able.
 Please take care of yourself and be well, my friend.

 It‚Äôs been translated into Italian.
 It is going viral on Whatsapp, but it was spread as something written during a plague in the 19th century.
 This was posted today to rectify the matter and give you proper credit: https://www.bufale.net/la-bufala-della-poesia-scritta-durante-lepidemia-della-peste-nel-1800/ This is the Italian translation.
 I want you to know that your poem is bringing healing to my suffering, beautiful native country.
 This Italian in the US is very grateful to you.
 Thank you.
 ‚ÄúE la gente rimase a casa E lesse libri e ascolt√≤ E si ripos√≤ e fece esercizi E fece arte e gioc√≤ E impar√≤ nuovi modi di essere E si ferm√≤ E ascolt√≤ pi√π in profondit√† Qualcuno meditava Qualcuno pregava Qualcuno ballava Qualcuno incontr√≤ la propria ombra E la gente cominci√≤ a pensare in modo differente E la gente guar√¨.

 Your words exemplify loving kindness, and a beautiful attitude toward the world.
 Thank you.

 Now realised that you wrote it in those days, congratulations for those heart touching words.
 If you don‚Äôt mind, I translate your words to my language, catalan (just one doubt, I wrote Terra ‚Äì earth- in capitals, as our planet.
 Is that right?)
 and posted on Facebbok with a link to this page.
 Thank you!!!!

 It truly gives words to the perspective with which I observe these events.
 It does seem that you are being confused with a 19th century author by the name of Kathleen O‚ÄôMeara.
 Reply        Kitty says:     								March 28, 2020 at 1:12 PM							     Thank you for writing, Daniel.
 The confusion seems to have abated.
 I think this helps to clarify.
 (Well, this, and actual research): https://wordpress.com/post/the-daily-round.com/4963 I hope you are safe and well.
 Gentle peace, Kitty O‚ÄôMeara  Reply              LisaNordstrom says:     								March 20, 2020 at 2:27 PM							     The most wonderful poem ever~ I have shared and credited you for writing these words that mean so much during this time~ Thank you~  Reply        Kitty says:     								March 20, 2020 at 3:24 PM							     How kind, Lisa!
 I can assure you, though, that there are many, many wonderful poems to feed your spirit during this time.
 I‚Äôm sure glad mine was one that touched you; that means the world to me.
 Now, please take care of yourself and be safe, Lisa!
 Joy, and gentle peace.

 We love your poem and would like to include it in our service on 3/22.
 There are different copyright rules for broadcasting than for printed material.
 May we use it, making sure to give you proper credit, of course?
 joannafoley33@gmail.com  Reply        Synnax Cynet says:     								March 20, 2020 at 6:22 PM							     I‚Äôm was confused too.
 But I also done a little investigation.
 This words are spreading as words from Iza‚Äôs Story (1869), but they do not appear in Iza‚Äôs Story, as many claim.
 The book has been digitized by the British Library and is freely available, it does not seem to me that these words appear in it.
 In short, this poem is by kitty Thank you Kitty!

 You can respond to this request here or jennifer.stateofmind@gmail.com.
 Thank you for this wonderful contribution!
 Reply        Jennifer Young says:     								March 21, 2020 at 5:51 PM							     Hi Kitty, I forgot to ask if you have an audio file of this poem.
 It would be wonderful if you could give permission (and send an audio version, if you have one) as soon as possible, as we are working hard to pull the podcast together this weekend.
 .
 Thank you again for your artistry and vision.
 Reply          Kitty says:     								March 21, 2020 at 7:52 AM							     Welcome, Mel.
 I have some invitations for you.
 First, learn how to do scholarly research.
 It is not accomplished by tacking together a fabricated reality from googled sources.
 Next, take time daily to soften and examine the energy you offer yourself and the world.
 Jung called this shadow work and Ignatius called it an examination of conscience.
 It‚Äôs necessary that we all do this to deepen our healing and wholeness.
 It‚Äôs work and it‚Äôs a choice.
 We are each responsible for our own growth.
 It involves asking questions and sitting with the answers, and then going deeper, as we are able.
 If we have derived joy from passively-aggressively making hurtful comments to a complete stranger, or to anyone, we can explore what feelings moved us to do so, for surely that is not the work of the Spirit of love in or hearts.
 It‚Äôs not who we want to be.
 Healing involves great doses of forgiveness (of self and others), great honesty, gentleness, and love.
 We all deserve this.
 Follow the triggers and pokes others evoke from your shadow.
 Negative comments, for example, often indicate someone‚Äôs manner, speech, success, presence, etc., has poked a shadow feeling, something we feel about ourselves and do not want to meet.
 Take it deeper: Is there a hurt, loss, grief, anger, rejection, shame, (and so on) hiding inside that can only find safety by projecting out towards others?
 What is missing in your life and heart that would soothe this feeling?
 Can you meet this feeling, and name it, and assure it of your love?
 Our shadows are not our enemies.
 In some ways, they protect us from deeper hurts, so go only as far as you can while still feeling safe.
 Professional counselors are available and this is their passion and expertise.
 Do the work.
 Every day.
 Heal.
 Again.
 Finally, create, in the unique ways you came to create, works of art that speak of your healing and love to the world.
 These are all choices and some are scary.
 This is a scary time.
 Love is winning, everywhere I look.
 I send love to you, Mel, and please let me know, if you choose to welcome any of my invitations, how I can help support you further.
 Be well, gentle peace.

 So uplifting in this uncertain time!
 Thanks so much for sharing this to the world.

 From Cebu, Philippines  Reply        Kitty says:     								March 21, 2020 at 12:39 PM							     Blessings to you as well, Cat!
 I hope you are well and safe.
 I have friends in the Philippines, and try to keep updated on how you are managing during this troubling time.
 Thank you for your kindness in writing.
 Take care and gentle peace.
 Reply          Alessia says:     								March 21, 2020 at 12:17 PM							     Dear Kitty, I really enjoyed your poem, the feelings you express and the emotions you convey.
 I also liked your piece on ‚ÄúUnpacking virulence‚Äù.
 Several readers have questioned the originality of your poem, stating there is a very similar composition in ‚ÄúIza‚Äôs Story‚Äù by Kathleen O‚ÄôMeara alias Grace Ramsay.
 I have a request for those who doubt your authorship: I would like them to please produce evidence and/or a copy of Ramsay‚Äôs poem, like a photocopy from her book.
 Otherwise, I wish they will abstain from any sort of accusations.
 Others have referred to a poem by Italian journalist Irene Vella and you have already replied ‚Äì the two poems address similar concerns but are indeed different.
 In these exceptional times, I hope everybody will try to have kindness and positivity at heart.
 Reply        Kitty says:     								March 21, 2020 at 12:36 PM							     Hi, Alessia, Thank you for writing.
 I hope you are well and able to stay safe.
 Thank you so much for taking time to write.
 We can let go of worry about small things at this time and look for the comfort, inspiration, and peace we are offering each other.
 Please be well, and gentle peace.
 Reply        David F√†bregues i Rey says:     								March 22, 2020 at 8:56 AM							     Dear Alessia and those who search for information, there is an article from an italian website (bufale.net) that explains this case.
 For those who speak or understand italian this is the link: https://www.bufale.net/la-bufala-della-poesia-scritta-durante-lepidemia-della-peste-nel-1800/ Regarding the poem in ‚ÄúIza‚Äôs story‚Äù, you can find that there is no evidence of this poem visiting ‚Äúthe British Library virtually at this address https://www.bl.uk/.
 The British Library‚Äôs official website allows free consultation of online books, and the contents of each volume are indexed to allow bibliographic research.
 As you can certainly verify ‚Äì given that online consultation allows you to search through keywords within the volumes required ‚Äì there is no evidence of viral poetry.
 No poem in the books consulted, no writing inspired by the plague.‚Äù I hope this information would help on this matter.
 Kind regards to all.
 Reply        Kitty says:     								March 22, 2020 at 10:09 AM							     Thank you, David, how very kind of you to use your gifts so well!
 The internet is a great blessing, if we use it wisely, isn‚Äôt it?!
 Please take care of yourself, my friend, and be well.
 Love and gentle peace, Kitty  Reply            Elenabeth says:     								March 21, 2020 at 1:00 PM							     Dear Kitty, Is ‚ÄúIN THE TIME OF PANDEMIC‚Äù the title?
 Congrats for your words, love it!
 Reply        Kitty says:     								March 21, 2020 at 1:16 PM							     It‚Äôs the one I prefer!
 Love you; thanks.
 üôÇ  Reply        Kerry says:     								March 22, 2020 at 11:03 AM							     I pray this is a prophecy, not only the poem that defines the era.
 This is get-you-on-Oprah level writing.üòÅ I look forward to reading more!
 Reply        Kitty says:     								March 22, 2020 at 1:41 PM							     Hi, Kerry‚Ä¶I see the time as an opportunity to really examine our lives and cultures, the architecture of how we interact and design our societies Altruism, yes, but there are real possibilities.
 We will still be human, but we can make real and better choices for ourselves and the earth.
 Hard work, but possible.
 So many are suffering, enduring loss, dying; we cannot allow these things to happen in vain.
 So, I hope.
 Thank you for writing; be well and safe.
 Gentle peace.
 Reply          Scott says:     								March 22, 2020 at 12:03 PM							     Hi Kitty, I absolutely love this poem, would I be able to use the text in a motivational film, and bring it to life with images and animated text?
 Obviously I‚Äôd be crediting you!
 I wish you peace regardless x  Reply        Kitty says:     								March 22, 2020 at 1:43 PM							     Hi, Scott, thank you for writing and for asking; that is kind of you.
 I so not want these words used for commercial gain; that really goes against the spirit of the words.
 But if you are doing this as something to offer freely, then please use them, and in peace.
 I love that so many artists are using them for collaboration and extension of the themes.
 Be well and stay safe.
 Reply          Dana Myers says:     								March 22, 2020 at 1:24 PM							     Dear Kitity, I confess I‚Äôm one of the people who shared your spirit-filled, inspiring poem on Facebook and I ask your forgiveness for doing this without requesting permission.
 Even though I knew I should have asked, I was so moved by it that I wanted everyone I know to read it and I acted accordingly.
 Your biography resonated with me.
 I did a CPE internship in the late 1980‚Äôs and so wanted to become a hospital chaplain but it wasn‚Äôt possible.
 I am widowed and my children are all grown and live away so I have four-legged companions as you do.
 I have two Great Pyrenees dogs and three cats that make life beautiful .
 Most of all your spirituality resonates with me deeply; you live guided by the Spirit which is what I try to do.
 God bless you.
 Dana  Reply        Kitty says:     								March 22, 2020 at 1:53 PM							     Dear Dana, as I have told others, I am not at all upset that people have shared and have received comfort from this poem; it is a deep honor and blessing.
 Share away.
 I pray people do not use my words for commercial endeavors; that is antithetical to the spirit of these words.
 And they are the Spirit‚Äôs, as you know.
 I love how people are using the poem to make collaborative art.
 How beautiful!
 Your companions sound delightful!
 I hope you are safe and well, and remain that way, and that the same is true for your children and their families, Dana.
 Take great care, and gentle peace.
