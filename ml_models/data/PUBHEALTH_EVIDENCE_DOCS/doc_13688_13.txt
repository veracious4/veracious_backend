 The dramatics of Washington and Tallahassee often overshadow the work of local government, but City Hall is where the decisions are made that have the greatest impact on people’s daily lives.
 It’s my job to keep it interesting so more people stay engaged with their community.
 I’m also on the Tampa Bay Times’ hurricane team, and have been deployed to report on the aftermaths of three storms: Hermine in 2016, Irma in 2017 and Michael in 2018.
 I find serenity in following recipes, the more complicated the better.
 I’m a bourbon fan, an amatuer pizza critic and a Pinellas Trail bike rider.
 Otherwise I like watching YouTube and talking on the phone.
 I’m proudly from New Jersey, don’t @ me for it — or do, it won’t matter.
 I came to the Times in 2014 after graduating from Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism.

 As a Briton and a member of Parliament, Gale is barred by U.S. law from giving Trump money, much less voting for him.
 The solicitations prompted watchdog groups in Washington to file two separate complaints Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission alleging that the Trump campaign was violating federal law by soliciting funds from foreign nationals.
 His campaign said it raised $2 million in less than 12 hours after blasting out its first email.
 But the emails to foreign nationals have caused a distraction, at best, and some experts have raised questions about whether his initial appeals landed in supporters' spam folders at a higher rate than normal.
