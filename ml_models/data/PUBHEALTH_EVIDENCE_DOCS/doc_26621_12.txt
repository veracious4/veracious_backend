 The FDA could change its rules to speed things up, but hasn’t.

 Response to COVID-19       Update, March 17, 2020: On Sunday, March 15, the Food and Drug Administration revised its Emergency Use Authorization to no longer require public health laboratories to send their tests to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation.

 A federal directive that’s supposed to speed up the response to a pandemic is actually slowing down the government’s rollout of coronavirus tests.
 The directive, issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, requires that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a sister agency, retest every positive coronavirus test run by a public health lab to confirm its accuracy.
 The result, experts say, is wasting limited resources at a time when thousands of Americans are waiting in line to get tested for COVID-19.
 The duplicative effort is the latest obstacle that is slowing the federal response to COVID-19, which has infected more than 1,300 people and resulted in 38 deaths in the United States.
 Progress was already delayed because the CDC decided to make its own test rather than adopting the design endorsed by the World Health Organization.
 The test then didn’t work properly and had to be fixed.
 The problems were further compounded by delays in certifying tests by private laboratories as well as a shortage of supplies and raw materials used for testing.
