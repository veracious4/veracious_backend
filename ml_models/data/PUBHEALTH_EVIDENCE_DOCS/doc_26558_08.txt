 Under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act), the FDA Commissioner may allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by CBRN threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.
 Section 564 of the FD&amp;C Act was amended by the Project Bioshield Act of 2004 and was further amended by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA), the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016, and Public Law 115-92 of 2017.
 Please note: a determination under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act that a public health emergency exists, such as the one issued on January 31, 2020, does not enable FDA to issue EUAs.
 A separate determination and declaration are needed under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to enable FDA to issue EUAs, provided other statutory criteria are met.
 Information on terminated and revoked EUAs can be found in archived information.
 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act)  Information on the PREP Act can be found here.
 The PREP Act amended the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) to add section 319F-3 (42 U.S.C.
 247d-6d).
 The HHS Secretary has issued several Declarations pursuant to section 319F-3 of the PHS Act to provide liability immunity for activities related to medical countermeasures against COVID-19.
 PREP Act - COVID-19 Related Information Notice of Declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID-19 (February 4, 2020) Amended April 10, 2020 to add countermeasures pursuant to the CARES Act COVID-19 - Medical Countermeasures (effective February 4, 2020) Amended April 10, 2020 to add countermeasures pursuant to the CARES Act OGC Advisory Opinion on PREP Act Declaration Advisory Opinion 02-02 on the PREP Act and the Secretary's Declaration under the Act  Second Amendment to Declaration under the PREP Act for Medical Countermeasures against COVID-19 Third Amendment to Declaration under the PREP Act for Medical Countermeasures Against COVID–19      Guidance In January 2017, FDA finalized the guidance: Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related Authorities.
 For more information, please see the January 13, 2017 Federal Register notice.
 Printable PDF (288 KB) In addition, in January 2014, FDA issued a question and answer document (PDF, 762K) to respond to questions raised by public health stakeholders about PAHPRA’s amendments to the EUA authority and establishment of new authorities related to the emergency use of MCMs during CBRN emergencies.
 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) EUA Information Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) updates from FDA Overviews:  FDA Combating COVID-19 With Medical Devices (PDF, 708 KB) FDA Combating COVID-19 With Therapeutics (PDF, 610 KB) EUA Authorized Serology Test Performance  Detailed Information for all COVID-19 EUAs, including authorizations and fact sheets In Vitro Diagnostic Products Personal Protective Equipment and Related Devices Ventilators and Other Medical Devices Drug and Biological Products   In Vitro Diagnostic Products On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves the virus that causes COVID-19.
 On the basis of this determination, the Secretary then declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of the virus that causes COVID-19.
 The EUAs subsequently issued by FDA are listed in the table below this blue box.
 In continuing response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 24, 2020, and based on the February 4, 2020 HHS EUA determination, the HHS Secretary declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of medical devices, including alternative products used as medical devices, due to shortages during the COVID-19 outbreak.
 EUAs for home collection kits reference this declaration.
 On February 29, 2020, the FDA issued an immediately in effect guidance with policy specific to development of in vitro diagnostic tests during this public health emergency.
 This guidance was updated on March 16, 2020, May 4, 2020, and May 11, 2020.
 CDC has granted a right of reference to the performance data contained in CDC's EUA (FDA submission number EUA200001) to any entity seeking an FDA EUA for a COVID-19 diagnostic device.
 Templates for these EUA submissions are available to help facilitate the preparation, submission, and authorization of an EUA.

 Specifically, FDA has determined that CQ and HCQ are unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA.
 Additionally, in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of CQ and HCQ no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use.
 This warrants revocation of the EUA for HCQ and CQ for the treatment of COVID-19.

 On October 22, 2020, FDA approved Veklury (remdesivir) for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
 Veklury should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care.
 This approval does not include the entire population that had been authorized to use Veklury under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) originally issued on May 1, 2020.
 In order to ensure continued access to the pediatric population previously covered under the EUA, the EUA for Veklury continues to authorize Veklury for emergency use by licensed healthcare providers for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg to less than 40 kg or hospitalized pediatric patients less than 12 years of age weighing at least 3.5 kg.

 As a result, there is a shortage of adequate, FDA-approved  drugs used for their treatment, such as propofol for sedation of mechanically ventilated patients.
 2 In the circumstances of this public health emergency, it would not be feasible to require healthcare providers to seek to limit Fresenius Propoven 2% Emulsion only to be used for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; therefore, this authorization does not limit use to such patients.
 3 The multiBic/multiPlus Solutions include multiBic dialysate and replacement fluid and multiPlus dialysate.
 The multiBic replacement fluid is regulated as a drug by CDER.
 The multiFiltrate PRO System, multiBic dialysate and the multiPlus dialysate solutions are regulated as devices by CDRH.

 back to top of page       Anthrax EUAs     The 2016 FDA Doxycycline Emergency Dispensing Order and CDC Doxycycline Emergency Use Instructions (EUI) together replace the need for the doxycycline mass dispensing EUA (issued on July 21, 2011).
 Therefore, the doxycycline emergency dispensing order and EUI should be used by stakeholders for anthrax preparedness and response instead of the mass dispensing EUA.
 The July 21, 2011, doxycycline mass dispensing EUA, and the October 14, 2011, National Postal Model anthrax EUA will be terminated by FDA, and notice of such termination will be published in the Federal Register.

 Ebola Diagnostic Tests with De Novo, 510(k) or PMA OraQuickEbola Rapid Antigen Test - On October 10, 2019, FDA allowed marketing (PDF, 255 KB) of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect Ebola virus antigens (proteins) in human blood from certain living individuals and samples from certain recently deceased individuals suspected to have died from Ebola (cadaveric oral fluid).
 The OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test is the first rapid diagnostic test the FDA has allowed to be marketed in the U.S. for Ebola virus disease (EVD).
 The test provides a rapid, presumptive diagnosis that must be confirmed.
 Also see the FDA news release: FDA allows marketing of first rapid diagnostic test for detecting Ebola virus antigens 	The OraQuick Ebola Test was reviewed under the De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for low-to-moderate-risk devices of a new type.
 Along with this marketing authorization, the FDA is establishing criteria, called special controls, that determine the requirements for demonstrating accuracy, reliability and effectiveness of tests intended to identify Ebola virus antigens.
 These special controls, when met along with general controls, provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for tests of this type.
 This action also creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA’s 510(k) pathway, whereby devices can obtain clearance by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device.
