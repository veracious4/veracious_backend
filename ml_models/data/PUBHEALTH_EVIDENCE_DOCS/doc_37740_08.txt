 Miller himself tweeted a screenshot of the tweet, as well as a “nice try, hackers” comment:Nice try, hackers.
 Twitter needs to work on their security issues.
 https://t.co/rtRB968vkZ— KW Miller For Congress (FL-18) (@KwCongressional) July 16, 2020In that context, it looked as if Miller might be claiming that the tweet was fabricated rather than the result of a compromised account, but it was not entirely clear if he was claiming that someone gained access to his account, or if someone created a fake tweet to disparage him and his views.TheRoot.com reported on Miller’s racist purported tweet, adding that they had “no idea what the ‘K’ or ‘W’ stands for and [] don’t care to look it up” and referring to Miller as “Karen’s widower.” In his response, Miller clarified that he was alleging that his account had been compromised — presumably for that tweet and that tweet alone:I’ve just been informed that @TheRoot, a Black Supremacist blog, is attacking me for tweets posted while my account was hacked by Twitter in a hack that targeted the most prominent users of the site.— KW Miller For Congress (FL-18) (@KwCongressional) July 16, 2020In any event, the tweet itself is real.
 It was archived twice on July 15 2020, and read:Most white women join Black Lives Matter to fornicate with black men.As such, KW Miller’s account tweeted and deleted a remark about white women only joining Black Lives Matter for the purpose of having sex with black men.
 Miller later claimed that his account’s security had been breached, but he offered no evidence.Comments eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'truthorfiction_com-medrectangle-1','ezslot_6',127,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'truthorfiction_com-medrectangle-1','ezslot_7',127,'0','1']));eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'truthorfiction_com-medrectangle-1','ezslot_8',127,'0','2']));Article Sources +Florida, Man: House Candidate K.W.
