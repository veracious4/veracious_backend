Each health center employs a unique mix of health professionals to expand 
access to comprehensive, coordinated, continuous, and accountable 
primary and preventive care. The health center care team model includes 
clinical and non-clinical, as well as traditional and non-traditional, 
health and wellness professionals to meet patients™ complex medical, 
behavioral, oral, and other health care needs. For example, health centers 
are hiring new nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and certi˜ed 
nurse midwives at faster rates than they are hiring new physicians, and 
they are twice as likely to hire these non-physician providers than other 
practice settings.
5 Most health center care teams make extensive use 
of medical assistants and community health workers/promotoras.
6 In addition, more than 10% of health centers™ total workforce include sta˚ 
whose daily jobs enable patients to obtain health and social services, from 
community health workers/promotoras, care managers, health educa
-tors, transportation sta˚, and interpreters.
7 Health centers will continue to make greater use of diverse care teams as 
they progress to meet rising demand for care, further improve communi
-ty health, and make greater gains in system e˛ciency goals. Innovations 
in care team design are based on each health center community™s speci˜c 
needs, preferences, and resources. Increasingly, these innovations are 
strengthened by health centers™ engagement in interprofessional health 
professions training opportunities. As the health center workforce con
-tinues to expand and evolve, this brief o˚ers a snapshot of their current 
sta˛ng priorities.
CARE TEAMS AT HEALTH CENTERS
Clinical vacancies are important indicators of 
capacity challenges because they represent 
existing and funded positions for which a 
health center is actively recruiting but cannot 

positions or natural turnover, others may be 
symptomatic of overall national workforce 
challenges. Health centers, however, are at a 
particular disadvantage because they serve 
isolated or otherwise underserved commu-nities that face challenges in recruiting and 
Almost all health centers (95%) are experi-encing at least one clinical vacancy today. 
The most common clinical position health 
centers report to be currently vacant is fami-ly physician (Figure 1).8  More than two-thirds 
(69%) of health centers indicate that they are 
currently recruiting for at least one family 
physician, while about half are recruiting for 
a nurse practitioner or medical assistant 
(Figure 1). Additionally, 56% of health centers 
report experiencing at least one opening for 

licensed clinical social worker, psychologist, 
or other mental health/substance abuse 
Health centers on average have 13% of their 

vacant. This average vacancy rate is higher 
for family physicians (25%) and licensed 
clinical social workers (17%) (Figure 2). Health 
centers also have higher average vacancy 
rates for physicians than those experienced 
by hospitals (21% vs. 18%).9 HEALTH CENTERS™

areas experiencing provider shortages. Most NHSC clinicians continue to practice in underserved communities after completing their service obligations, with more than half (55%) continuing to practice in these ar-eas 10 years later.10  Health centers™ broad reach into underserved areas makes them ideal settings for NHSC members.As Figure 9 shows, an analysis of NHSC 
data reveals that more than half of all 
NHSC participants are providing care at a 
health center. More than three-quarters 
of NHSC dentists and dental hygienists, 

nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, and 
physicians are working at a health center. 
While health center providers make up 
53% of current NHSC participants, 61% 
of current NHSC vacancies are at health 
centers, further highlighting how important 

11  as federal funding can support. National centers have given up on utilizing the NHSC because of limits in the clinician placement program™s capacity. Among health centers that indicate they do not currently list posi-tions with the NHSC, 16% report that they did not think their qualifying score was high enough to receive NHSC clinicians.While the NHSC loan repayment and scholarship program is the largest federal program routing clinicians to underserved areas, some health centers also rely on other federal placement programs, such as the NURSE Corps and J-1 Visa Waivers, and workforce gaps. Without these important programs, health center vacancy rates would be much higher.

Health centers are active participants in the 
education and training of the next generation 
of primary care providers. Nearly all health cen
-ters are participating in some kind of education 
or trainingŠfor students, residents, or both. 
They also play a large role in employing pro-viders who have trained in the unique health 
center setting. Family physician and nurse 
practitioner are the provider types most com-monly trained at health centers today. Despite 
this, a number of key barriers prevent more 
health centers from participating in residency 
training programs. Lack of formal relationships 
with area medical schools and/or teaching hos-pitals, lack of space, and budgetary constraints 
or inadequate funding are the most commonly 
cited reasons for not participating in such 
programs (Figure 10).While local hospitals and/or medical schools 
are by far the most likely entities to hold the 
accreditation for the residency programs in 
which health centers are participating, more 
than 1 in 5 (22%) health centers report that 
they now hold the accreditation for their own 
residency programs (Figure 11).HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN HEALTH CENTERSFIGURE 10PERCENT OF HEALTH CENTERS REPORTING KEY BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATING IN RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMSLACK OF FORMAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH AREA MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND/OR TEACHING HOSPITALSLACK OF SPACEBUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS OR INADEQUATE FUNDINGLACK OF KNOWLEDGE IN HOW TO SET UP A HEALTH PROFESSIONS TRAINING PROGRAMCOMPLEXITY OF SETTING UP RESIDENCY PROGRAMCONCERN ABOUT LOST PRODUCTIVITY OF HEALTH CENTER™S STAFF DUE TO TEACHINGDISTRACTION FROM HEALTH CENTER™S SERVICE MISSION (E.G.

NACHC.ORGOver the past 50 years, health centers have grown from two small demonstration grantees to become the largest primary care net-work in the United States, thanks to strong support from Congress and both Democratic and Republican Presidents. That growth has led to a remarkable expansion of access to primary care. Yet the full potential of health centers™ historic growth continues to 
go unrealized, due primarily to the challenges they face in training, 
-en, and dynamic clinical workforce. Vacancies on a health center™s

patient growth. Indeed, with 95% of health centers reporting at least 
one clinical vacancy, they themselves collectively report that 2 million

despite these challenges, health centers have proven themselves as 
innovators in addressing costly chronic illness and addressing the root 
causes of poor health. Health centers are reaching beyond the walls 
of traditional medicine and partnering with other organizations to ap-ply bold community-based solutions to treat population health. They 
are starting food banks and community gardens, providing housing 
and job training, and integrating behavioral or oral health with primary

care system, and particularly those faced by health centers, there is no

move our system toward one that emphasizes access to high-quality 
primary care for all Americans, and especially for the underserved:Recruitment and retention incentives like the National Health 
Service Corps and other programs must be grown, strength-ened, and made to work for all Community Health Centers.Training and education of all primary care team members 
must continue to move towards the community settings where they will be providing care upon completion of their program. And, health centers should have a prominent place in any reform of our current health professions education and training system.Innovative care models must be embraced and incentivized 
with a focus on team-based approaches and greater use of technology to bridge gaps in care.Solving America™s primary care workforce challenges will not

NACHC ˜elded an online survey to all federally-funded health centers between November 2015 and January 2016 to 
assess their current clinical vacancies, sta˛ng priorities, perceptions of recruitment and retention challenges, and 
participation in programs that place or train clinicians in underserved areas. Some questions had been previously used 
in or adopted from a prior validated instrument, and the full survey instrument was reviewed by a national expert panel 
made up of academics, health center leaders, and other subject matter experts. Most surveys were completed by the health 
center CEO or Director of Human Resources. The ˜nal survey sample (N=499, 39% response rate) is representative of 
health centers nationally along key characteristics such as size (total patients), patient mix (percent with Medicaid 
and percent uninsured), geography (urban/rural location), and costs of care. Findings re˝ect a given point in time and 
therefore health centers™ priorities could change given capacity-building funding opportunities. Some vacancies re˝ect 
existing positions rather than new positions; therefore, NACHC extrapolated ˜ndings to estimate the number of new 
patients that could be reached nationally if all new positions were ˜lled. This was done by applying the proportions of 
health centers with any clinical vacancies and any new positions (95% and 66%, respectively) to the total number of 
federally-funded health center organizations nationally (nearly 1,300), and multiplying that by the average number of 
patients reached, as reported by survey respondents.
