REVIEW 1211 (2009)   Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they 
are in almost every kingdom in Europe. 
ŠNoah Webster, 1787
4  One of the ordinary modes, by which tyrants accomplish their purposes 
without resistance, is, by disarming the people, and making it an 
offence to keep arms . . . . 
ŠJoseph Story, 1840
5 INTRODUCTION
 Surprisingly in light of its enormous profusion since then,
6 little on the 
Second Amendment was written before 1980.  As I was one of the first of 
these late twentieth century writers, I sh
all provide an analysis of the modern 
etiology of what is called the ﬁStandard Modelﬂ of the Second Amendment 
by its adherents and opponents alike.
7  The Standard Model is, of course, the 
view accepted by the court in 
District of Columbia v. Heller
.8 This Essay provides my personal appraisal of the scholarly literature that 
led to the outcome in 
Heller
.  After first describing the Standard Model view 
adopted in 
Heller
, I proceed to discuss its acceptance by the legal academy, 
and what I view as major contributions 
to that acceptance.  I then move to 
discussing anti-Standard Model theories. 
In discussing these matters I begin with my own experience.  As a civil 
rights worker in the Sout
h in the early 1960s, I always had a gun close at 
hand.  But I had never thought seriously about the Second Amendment, 
                                                                                                                             4. N

 Second Amendment Historiography 
1213   much less researched it.  I took every civil liberties or constitutional law 
course Yale Law School then offered, but in those days none addressed the 
Second Amendment.  My only info
rmation on the subject was word-of-
mouth absorption of the then co
mmon wisdom in academia that the 
Second Amendment protected the states™ right to a militia but not any right 
of individuals. 
As a result, my first gun control ar
ticle said nary a thing about the 
Second Amendment, though its discussion did focus on the need of minorities 
and dissenters to be able to arm them
selves against night riders whom the 
government could not be trusted to control.
9  Shortly after its publication I 
received a sheaf of materials on the Se
cond Amendment, including a draft law 
review article from David Caplan,
10 who was then a member of the National 
Rifle Association (NRA) Board. 
Thus encouraged, I began my own Second Amendment research, which 
eventually led to the first modern public
ation on the subject in a leading law 
review.
11  It had a discussion of what I deemed as constitutionally permissible 
gun controls, many of which are bitterly opposed by the gun lobby.  This 
prompted the NRA magazine to dismiss my article as ﬁOrwellian Newspeak.ﬂ

 My first law review article was largely derivative of the NRA expert 
Professor Stephen Halbrook™s own early work,
13 along with that of David 
Caplan, Joyce Lee Malcolm,
14 and Robert Shalhope.
15  Though we all 
concluded that the Second Amendment 
guaranteed a meaningful individual 
right, our approaches often differed significantly. 
The work of Steve Halbrook, a philosophy professor turned lawyer, 
traced the ideology of popular possession 
of arms back to ancient Greek and 
Roman thought.
16  Professor Malcolm, a historian of England, focused on the 
                                                                                                                             9. Don B. Kates, Jr.,

REVIEW 1211 (2009)   common law tradition of the armed subject in a series of articles which culmi-
nated in her book, 
To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American 
Right.17  Professor Shalhope, an intellectua
l historian, emphasized the philoso-
phical background harking back to M
achiavelli and the English followers of 
the Florentine-Atlantic school™s ex
altation of the armed people.   
My own approach to the philosophy on which the Second Amendment 
rests stressed the right of personal self-defense,
18 which others mentioned but 
gave secondary attention.  Except for so
me Quakers, late eighteenth century 
Americans universally believed self-d
efense both a right and a duty.
19  Indeed, 
like Hobbes and Locke, they conceived self
-defense to be the paradigm of an 
inalienable right: ﬁthe great natural law of self preservation, which, as we have 
seen, cannot be repealed, or superseded, or suspended by any human institution
.ﬂ20 A related point is crucial for understanding why the Second 
Amendment exists: Late eighteenth centu
ry Americans believed the right to 
be armed for self-defense to be both integral to, and indistinguishable 
from, the right to self-defense.
21  Insofar as modern philosophers address such 
issues, they generally also find that the right of self-defense necessarily 
implies a right to have a gun.
22 While the late twentieth century exponents of the Second Amendment 
mentioned above differed somewhat from
 each other in approach, all paid 
homage to a point Randy Barnett has made explicit: While innumerable 
comments can be cited in which late eighteenth century Americans supported 
                                                                                                                             17.

 Second Amendment Historiography 
1215   the desirability of being armed and/or a right to arms,
23 not a single comment 
can be found describing the Second Amendment as a collective right or a 
right of states.
24  Or, as Stephen Halbrook put it: 
In recent years it has been suggested that the Second Amendment 
protects the ﬁcollectiveﬂ right of states to maintain militias, while it 
does not protect the right of ﬁthe peopleﬂ to keep and bear arms.  If 
anyone entertained this notion in the period during which the 
Constitution and Bill of Rights were debated and ratified, it remains 

one of the most closely gu
arded secrets of the ei
ghteenth century, for 
no known writing surviving from the period between 1787 and 1791 
states such a thesis.
25 This point is reinforced by Dave Kopel™s massive analysis of nineteenth 
century discourse on the Second Amendment finding many references 
interpreting it as an individual right and no apparent consciousness that it 
could be anything else.
26 In sum, the evidence consistently sh
owed the collective right and states™ 
right theories of the Amendment to be inventions of the twentieth century 
gun control debate that had no provenance in the thoughts of the Founding 
Fathers or of pre-twentieth century Amer
icans.  Modern legal writing on the 
Second Amendment right to arms overwhelmingly recognizes that it guarantees 
a right of law-abiding, responsible adults to possess arms for self-defense. 
                                                                                                                             23. Since so many quotations were given on the first two pages of this Essay, I limit myself to 
a few others: The author of the Second Amendment, James Madison, assured Americans that they 
need not fear government because of ﬁthe advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess 
over the people of almost every other nation.ﬂ  T

REVIEW 1211 (2009)   II. THE 
SECOND 
AMENDMENT AND THE 
(LEGAL
) ACADEMY
 In his early and seminal article, 
The Embarrassing Second Amendment
, Sanford Levinson asserted that writin
g on the subject had been mostly by 
nonmembers of the academy; he speculate
d that this might be because many 
members of the academy support banning guns and were reluctant to take on 

the topic lest they find themselves endor
sing as legal scholars a constitutional 
position at odds with their political preferences.
27 In truth, many early (pre-2000) scholarly publications came from 
practicing lawyers,
28 some of them gun lobby officers or employees.
29  By 
the same token, most of the few pre-2000 scholarly publications rejecting the 
individual right view came from office
rs or paid employees of the antigun 
lobby.30  But more frequent than the early
 articles from nonacademy authors 
                                                                                                                             27. Sanford Levinson,

e individual right view that Glenn 
Reynolds coined the term Standard Model to describe that position.
33 It bears emphasis that the law prof
essors who accept the Standard Model 
include many who are antigun; that is, not only have they never owned a gun 
or had any connection to the gun l
obby, but their policy preferences are 
stringent gun control or outright prohibition.  Sanford Levinson™s

O. Douglas, rigorously applies standards from his primary scholarship in the 
First Amendment to the Second Amendment.  Though he is not sympathetic 
to gun ownership, he writes that ﬁlike all other constitutional law scholars

 Second Amendment Historiography 
1219   Foolish liberals who are trying to r
ead the Second Amendment out of 
the Constitution by claiming it™s not an individual right or that it™s too 

much of a public safety hazard don™t see the danger in the big picture.  
They™re courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means 
to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don™t like.
36 The overwhelming acceptance for the Standard Model in the legal 
academy is made especially notable by its opponents™ attempts to counterbalance 
it.  These have included the antigun lobby™s generous financing of lesser law 

reviews to publish symposia on the Second Amendment in which only pieces 
opposing the Standard Model were allowed.

 MILESTONES IN THE 
AMENDMENT
™S MODERN
 HISTORIOGRAPHY
 Having addressed the Second Amendment literature in general, I 
proceed to spotlight in chronological order what I deem to be the most 
important writings which led to the result in 
Heller
.38 • Levinson™s 
Embarrassing Second Amendment
 article
.39  It forcibly 
directed the legal academy™s attention to the Second Amendment. 
• My Michigan Law Review
 article
.40  It provided an early road 
map of the Second Amendment for those interested in further 

research.  Today, it remains the single most influential and 
comprehensive law review article on this subject and routinely 
is briefly mentioned as such by Standard Model opponents.
41 • Stephen Halbrook™s research.
  For almost three decades Steve 
Halbrook has tirelessly researched the original sources on 
virtually every aspect of the Second Amendment and published 
                                                                                                                             36. Telephone Interview by Dan Gifford with Alan Dershowitz, Professor, Harvard Law

 37. Two of these symposia contained only
 papers opposing the Standard Model while a third 
had a single token Standard Model paper.  Carl T. Bogus, an antigun lobby official, has 

acknowledged that he sought to counterbalance the legal academy literature™s overwhelming 

acceptance of the Standard Model: ﬁWe felt that, for a variety of reasons, the collective rights model 

was under represented in the debate, and wanted to give scholars an opportunity to enhance or 

further illuminate the collective rights position.  Sometimes a more balanced debate is best served 

by an unbalanced symposium.ﬂ  Posting of Carl T. Bogus, to conlawprof@listserv.ucla.edu (June 11,

REVIEW 1211 (2009)   his findings in dozens of law review articles.
42  These articles™ 
findings have been encompassed in a series of books by 
Halbrook.
43  Indicative of the importance of various of his 
works is the recent opinion in 
which the Ninth Circuit held 
the Second Amendment to be applicable against state and 
local government because it is incorporated by the 
Fourteenth Amendment.
44  • Historian Joyce Lee Malcolm™s 1994 Harvard University Press 
book.45  It comprehensively covers the history of the right to 
arms at English common law and has material on seventeenth 
and eighteenth century America.
  The book demolishes attempts 
to dismiss the Second Amendment as a ﬁstates™ rightﬂ since, of 
course, England had no states to whom a right to arms could be 
misattributed.
46  Another desperate canard of Standard Model 
opponents is that seventeenth century English complaints 

about ﬁdisarmamentﬂ did not refer to any actual confisca-
tions of arms but rather only to replacement of Protestant 
army officers with Catholics.
47  This book shows that actual gun 
bans and disarmament were the issues involved.
48 • Discovery of prefatory clauses in the eighteenth century state bills of 
rights.
  Many readers of the Second Amendment took its prefatory 
reference to the militia as somehow modifying its sweeping 
right to arms clause.  This error was exposed by Eugene Volokh™s 
discovery that all kinds of late eighteenth century state constitu-
                                                                                                                             42. Halbrook™s research on the topic begins with Halbrook,

50 • My Constitutional Commentary article
.51  Both supporters and 
oppo-nents of the Standard Model, especially among the general 
populace, have assumed without examination that the 
purpose of the right to arms is to facilitate revolt against 
tyranny.  This article clarifies that the actual purpose of the 

right to arms is self-defense; as Blackstone described it, the right 
to arms is auxiliary to the right to self-defense that the 
Founders saw as the primary human right.  It bears emphasis, 
however, that the Founders did not view self-defense narrowly 
as just resisting apolitical violence; they saw it as including 
defense against political violence, for example, genocide.

Law & Contemporary Problems
,57 of which I 
was the guest editor.  My 
Michigan Law Review
 article
58 had 
wrongly asserted that in colonial times the phrase ﬁbear armsﬂ 
had an exclusively military meaning. 
 Given this error, I concluded 
that the Second Amendment was 
a guarantee for citizens to 
keep arms at home but had no implications as to civilians 
carrying arms outside the home.
59  Halbrook™s article demolished 
that by citing numerous late eighteenth century examples 
(including one of Madison) using the phrase ﬁbear armsﬂ in 
reference to hunting and other nonmilitary pursuits.
60 More important, our articles agreed that: (a) convicted 
felons have no right to arms and are properly subject to laws 
against their possessing guns; and 
(b) the right to arms extends 
only to ordinary small arms and not to the indiscriminate, 
ultradestructive military arms like cannons or missiles.

acceptance of the Standard Model

Levy, William Van Alstyne, and Eugene Volokh.
62 • Clayton Cramer, James Lindgren, and the Bellesiles Scandal.  
Michael Bellesiles was an Emory University history professor.  

He published a book and multiple articles full of preposterous 
lies such as: few colonial Americans owned or wanted to 

own firearmsŠthey relied on swords
 and axes instead; insofar as 
firearms were available they were owned by colonial 
governments not by individuals; and women and all non-land 
owning men were prohibit
ed from having guns.

 Second Amendment Historiography 
1223   Bellesiles was a masterful fabricator of footnotes.  But his 
fraudulence was easily apparent to anyone who compared the 
cited source to what he claimed it said.
64  Yet his claims 
supported the animus of ﬁprogressiveﬂ historians and law 
professors against the Standard Model.  Disregarding all evidence 
to the contrary, they acclaimed the book,
65 which was accorded 
Columbia University™s Bancroft 
Prize, generally considered the 
highest honor for a work of American history.
66 Bellesiles™ frauds were exposed through the criticisms of 
Clayton Cramer, an unaffiliate
d historian and gun owner, 
and James Lindgren, a Northwestern University Law Professor 
and expert on social science research.  Among other things, 
they uncovered the fact that probate records Bellesiles had 
purported to rely on said more or less the opposite from what 
he had alleged and that Bellesiles had not even reviewed them, 
though he claimed to have done so.
67  As a result of Cramer™s and 
Lindgren™s work, Emory University asked Bellesiles to resign.
68  Columbia University revoked his Bancroft Prize and demanded 
return of the prize money.
69  Bellesiles™ disgrace was widely 
                                                                                                                             64. For instance, Bellesiles claimed his ﬁexamination of eighty travel accounts written in 
America from 1750 to 1860 indicates that the travelers did not notice that they were surrounded by guns 

and violence,ﬂ or that many Americans hunted with guns.  B

REVIEW 1211 (2009)   reported.
70  This reflected negatively on the credibility of his 
gullible academic supporters and th
eir ahistorical attacks on the 
Standard Model. • The racist roots of gun control.
  As documented in a number of 
articles, racial and ethnic oppression and stereotypes have 
historically formed the basis for many antigun laws.
71 • Criminological research on self-defense.
  Eighteenth century 
liberals, both British and American, reposed great confidence in 
the efficacy of self-defense.  For instance, the English radical 
Francis Place attributed the diminut
ion of English antisemitism 
to Jews learning to defend themselves.
72  In contrast, the habit 
of twentieth century gun control 
advocates has been to deride 
the efficacy of self-defense, particularly with guns.
73  This 
derision has fared poorly as crim
inological evidence has become 
available.  For instance, Handgun Control chairman Pete Shields 
wrote that because burglars strike when no one is at home to 

shoot them and robbers confront too rapidly for householders 
to gain access to their guns, ﬁ[t]he handgun owner seldom even 
gets the 
chance

the streets, until they learned boxing: 
Dogs could not be used in the streets in the manner many Jews were treated.  One 
circumstance among others put an end to the ill-usage of the Jews . . . . [sic] About the year 

1787 Daniel Mendoza, a Jew, became a celebrated boxer and set up a school to teach the art 

of boxing as a science, the art soon spread among the young the Jews and they became 

generally expert at it.  The consequence was in a very few years seen and felt too.  It was no 

longer safe to insult a Jew unless he was an old man and alone . . . . [sic] But even if the Jews 

were unable to defend themselves, the few who would now be disposed to insult them 

merely because they are Jews, would be in danger of chastisement from the passers-by and of 

punishment from the police.

Americans scare away home invaders with firearms.
75  More 
generally, three to six times as many victims use handguns to 
defend against criminals each 
year as criminals use handguns 
to commit crimes
76Šso guns do up to six times more good than 
harm.  In addition Handgun Control™s advice to victims of rape 
or robbery is never to resist in
 any way: The best way to ﬁkeep 
you[rself] aliveﬂ is to ﬁput up no defenseŠgive them what they 
want, or run.ﬂ
77  But empirical studies 
conclude: ﬁThe use of a 
gun by the victim significantly 
reduces her likelihood of being 
injured;ﬂ
78 ﬁ[r]esistance with a gun appears to be the most 
effective in preventing serious inju
ry [to the victim, and] . . . the 
data strongly indicate that armed resistance is the most effective 
tactic for preventing property loss . . . .ﬂ
79 Though theoretically irrelevant to the legal issues, these 
results severely impacted legal academy resistance to the 

Standard Model. • Criminological studies on gun control.  
In the 1960s, crime became 
a national issue and right-thinking progressive members of the 
academy accepted the crucial assumptions of the firearms 
prohibition movement.  But these assumptions were based on 
nothing more than unsubstantiated speculation; as the premier 
legal academy proponent of gun control later admitted, ﬁIn the 
1960s, there was literally no scho
larship on the relationship 
between guns and violence and th
e incidence or consequences 
of interpersonal violence, and no work in progress.ﬂ
80  When 
actual evidence became available it was uniformly negative to 
the unsubstantiated antigun speculations, and social scientists 
                                                                                                                             75.

81  Confirming 
all of this are two recent general 
studies of gun control.  In 2004, 
the U.S. National Academy of Sciences released its evaluation 
based on review of 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 govern-
ment publications, and some empirical research of its own.
82  It 
could not identify any gun control measures that had reduced 
violent crime, suicide, or gun accidents.
83  The same conclusion 
was reached in a 2003 evaluation by the Centers for Disease 
Control™s then-extant studies.
84 This vast corpus of negative criminol
ogical evaluations of gun control 
has been widely reported in sources available to the legal academy.
85  Again, 
though legally irrelevant, this research corroded legal academy opposition to 
the Standard Model. 
A last point critically important in establishing the Standard Model is 
that the Second Amen
dment has to mean 
something

meanings which have been so desperately invented by its opponents are 

either historically false or patently nonsensical.

the School of Criminology at the State University of New York (Albany) wrote that actual research 

has proven:  
[W]hen used for protection, firearms can seriously inhibit aggression and can provide a 

psychological buffer against the fear of crime.  Furthermore, the fact that national patterns 

show little violent crime where guns are most dense implies that guns do not elicit aggression 

in any meaningful way. . . . Quite the contrary, these findings suggest that high saturations of 

guns in places, or something correlated with that condition, inhibit illegal aggression.

 Second Amendment Historiography 
1227   IV. COLLECTIVE 
RIGHT 
THEORIES
: NONSENSE AND 
NONSENSE 
ON STILTS
 The collective right view sees th
e Second Amendment as creating a 
right that belongs to everyone collectively, so that no one individual 
possesses or can assert it.  As one propon
ent pithily describes it, the right to 
arms the Amendment guarantees applies 
not to individual people, but ﬁto the 
whole people as body politic.ﬂ
86 A right that everyone has so no on
e can exercise it?  This is not a 
theory.  It is gibberish falsely garbed as 
a legal claim.  It bears emphasis that 
none of its purported advocates has ever bothered to detail the meaning of 
this collective right gibberish, what effect it has, or why Congress would write 
a meaningless right into th
e Bill of Rights.  Its proponents have no interest, 
and understandably see no point, in trying to explain this claim; their purpose 
in inventing it is to provide an expl
anation of the Amendment alternative to 
the Standard Model. 
Contrast this ﬁcollective rightﬂ gibberish
 to the ﬁcollectiveﬂ rights that our 
Constitution actually does create: Th
e First Amendment creates a right for 
people to associate and for groups to a
ssemble and petition government.  Any 
member of a group denied those collect
ive rights may vindicate them by 
litigating for himself and the group.  Li
kewise, the Fifteenth and Nineteenth 
Amendments prohibit discrimination against voters singled out because of 
their race, color, or sex.  Any person denied the right to vote because of mem-
bership in a group defined by race, color,
 or sex may sue to vindicate his own 
right and those of the other group members. 
Can any honest personŠmuch less a scrupulous legal scholarŠseriously 
propose that a right can belong to ever
yone in such a manner that no one 
can assert it?  This is an oxymoron; a pa
radigm of pseudointellectual gibberish. 
If the collective rights theory is nonsense, the so-called sophisticated 
collective right theory is nonsense on stilts.
87  It posits that there is a right to 
                                                                                                                             86. Prince,

theory.
  Emerson v. United States

collective right but analyzes it separately from the collective right theory.  
United States v. Parker

circuit decisions that also did so.  But 
Parker v. District of Columbia

in the context of militia or military 
service.  Again, meaningless gibbe
rish.  Its proponents have notŠbecause 
they cannotŠadduced even one example of
 what a right to arms means that 
can only be exercised in the context of militia or military service.  In abeyance 
of their making such inquiries, let me raise a few: 
1) Under current U.S. Army practice, soldiers are not allowed to 
possess either their own arms or military arms without special 
permission.  The normal practice is
 that they are unarmed.  When 
committed to a combat zone they are still not permitted to have their 
personal arms.  They are issued particular weapons which the Army 
deems suitable to the duties it has assigned them.
88 It would be interesting to query whether these practices are 
something a soldier can sue to ha
ve a court invalidate according to 
the supposed Second Amendment right that can only be exercised in 
the context of militia or military service? 
2) Under the sophisticated collect
ive right theory of the Second 
Amendment, can a soldier or militia member who has been issued the 
                                                                                                                             88. My interview with Lt. Col. Dana K. Drenkowski, career military officer (JAG) (July 21, 
2008), elaborates on this: 
[On] every military base in the US, soldiers have to get the commander™s permission 
to bring their own personally owned weapons on base.  If they live in dorms or quarters for 

single soldiers, they have to store the weapons in the military police armory on base and 

check them out for use. 
. . . 
If soldiers live in a house on base (usually family men or women), they can store the 
weapons at the house, but all have to be registered with the military police/commander™s 

office.  This is universal throughout bases in the US, in all military forces . . . . 
Overseas, they are usually not allowed to keep weapons on base, but again that is 
subject to local regulations (where the host country doesn™t allow weapons, the soldiers 

cannot bring any to that assignment). 
As far as weapons to use in combat, they indeed are issued what is believed [by the 
military] to be necessary, but are traditionally forbidden from bringing their own personal 

weapons to the party.  This regulation is normally done by the theatre commanderŠit is 

his or her decision whether to allow personal weapons (normally just handguns), and the 

usual answer is NO . . . . 
This is true for all services, as far as I know.  It is usually not a service-wide 
requirement/ban, but done at a local level or, in combat, at the ﬁtheatre levelﬂ or combat 

command level.  Theatre would be defined as the overall commander of combat forces in a 

theatre of combat.  The combat command level for Iraq is the troop commander in Iraq 

itself.  For example, Iraq is part of the Central Command theatre . . . . 
My published orders sending me to Iraq had about 14 or 18 ﬁspecial amendmentsﬂ or 
additions on the back; one of them was that ﬁpersonal firearms are forbidden.ﬂ  I am aware 
that sometimes one can have that paragraph omitted, or even have a paragraph amended to 
say that personal firearms are permitted, but that would depend upon having someone high 

up who approves and who will provide permission to change that particular paragraphŠmost 

of the time the commanders responsible for the orders would not change that paragraph, 

knowing as they did the MNF-I CO™s feelings.

3) Does the sophisticated collective right theory mean that a 
soldier or militia member trained and assigned (without a firearm) to a 
kitchen as a cook has a right to reassign himself to the front lines with 
a rifle? 
If it does not mean any of these things, what does it mean to call 
the Second Amendment a right to arms 
that can (only) be exercised in the 
context of militia or military service?  And why do these queries have to 
be raised by an opponent of the coll

V. THE 
STATES
™ RIGHT
 THEORY
 The alternative states™ right theory that the Amendment was intended 
to exalt and to restore state control over the militias is not gibberish.
89  It is an 
intelligible theory.  But it is entirely ahistorical, being beset by problems 
which states™ right theo
ry proponents have dealt with only by never 
mentioning them.  Let me briefly describe some of the major problems: 
1) The Second Amendment guarantees a ﬁright of the people,ﬂ 
phraseology which everywhere else in the Constitution denotes individ-
ual rights; nor does the Amendment use terms such as ﬁpowersﬂ or 
ﬁauthority,ﬂ which is how government powers are described throughout 
the Constitution.
90 2) The Second Amendment was not the product of some devotee 
of states™ rights and powers vis-a-vis the federal government.  It was 
authored by James Madison who was so extreme an advocate of 
federal power vis-a-vis the states th
at he deemed the Constitutional 
Convention a failure becau
se it: a) rejected his proposal for a federal 
veto power over all state legislation; and b) provided for a Senate 
consisting of representatives of the states whereas Madison wanted 
representation to be apportioned according to population with no 
concession to the states as states.
91                                                                                                                              89. Articles espousing the states™ right theory are epitomized by Ehrman and Henigan™s 
writings.

REVIEW 1211 (2009)   3) Madison and his mentor Jefferson did not see the federal powers in 
the original Constitution as excessive vis-à-vis the states; if anything 

needed correction, they believed, it 
was the lack of a set of guarantees 
for personal rights, not a lack of guarantees for states™ rights.
92  4) In discussing his proposals in Congress, Madison differentiated the 
criticism some politicians had levelled at the Constitution for diminishing 
state power from the concern of the great majority of the people, which 
was the lack of a bill of rights protecting individual liberties.
93 5) Far from thinking the Second Amendment would meet their 
desire to guarantee state powers ove
r the militia, Anti-Federalists in 
the First Congress sought to accomplish this by separate proposed 

constitutional amendmentsŠwhich were defeated by the Federalist-
majority Senate.
94 6) Neither in Congress nor the state legislatures was there either 
any objection to an indi
vidual right clause or 
any suggestion that it 
would restore state power over the militia; the only objections made 
were to the militia clause on the ground that it did not do anything.
95 7) The Amendment follows early state constitutional rights 
provisions in having a 
prefatory clause (the 
militia clause) preceding 
the rights declaration; the principle of construction, then as now, was 
that the prefatory clause cannot na
rrow or nullify the declared right.
96 8) Notwithstanding the Second Amendment, from the earliest 
time the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held federal authority 
over the militia to be plenary with state authority limited to matters as 
to which the federal government has not spoken.

 Second Amendment Historiography 
1231   CONCLUSION
 From the enactment of the Second Amendment until the outset of the 
early twentieth century gun control debate, it was understood that this 
Amendment guaranteed all responsibl
e, law-abiding Americans a right to 
possess firearms for personal defense.  Fictions such as the states™ right theory 

or collective right theories were enti
rely unknown to the Founding Fathers 
and for a century after their time. 
One aspect of the twentieth century gun control debate was the inven-
tion and acceptance of these fictions in
 order to facilitate proposals to ban 
and to confiscate all firearms.  But in
 the late twentieth century these inven-
tions led to a very substantial debate among legal scholars.  From that schol-
arship, and often contrary to the scholars™ personal preferences, the 
overwhelming conclusion of legal and historical writers is that the Second 
Amendment preserves the right of all responsible, law-abiding adults to be 

armed for the defense of themselves, their homes, and their families. 
Recognizing these facts does not doom 
rational, moderate controls.  The 
National Rifle Association should accept th
at many possible controls are just 
plain common sense.  For example, the NRA itself pioneered laws prohibiting 
handgun possession for persons who had been convicted of violent 
crimes.  These laws have now sensibly been extended to prohibiting possession 
of any kind of firearms by the deranged and by children.
98  Likewise, there is 
no legitimate (that is, ordinary sporting or self-defense) reason for civilians 
to possess indiscriminate, superdestructive military weaponry (for example, 

bazookas, grenades, or missiles). 
The Second Amendment does not preclude such sensible lawsŠnor 
many foolishly non-cost-effective ones such as gun registration.
99  This 
Amendment protects only responsible, la

hunting and other proper purposes.  
See, e.g.
, Pierce v. Soc™y of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 519 (1925) 
(noting a parental right to have children attend parochial schools); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 

(1923) (holding that a statute forbidding teaching children languages other than English infringes 

parental right of control under due process).

 opinion 
for ahistorically endorsing laws against gun possession by felons, the insane, and children.

Heller
 does neglect to 
furnish it, there is ample historical support for excluding such people from the right to arms: Nations 

which accepted the right to arms invariably extended that right only to virtuous citizens; and at

REVIEW 1211 (2009)   The states™ right and collective right views are not just intellectually 
frivolous.  They have had a severely n
egative effect on rational gun controls 
by producing blind irredentist opposition to
 regulation in the belief that the 
gun control movement™s goal is prohibition and confiscation of all arms kept 
for defense of one™s family, home, and self.
101  Now that 
Heller 
has recognized 
the unconstitutionality of such legislation, it is to be hoped that the gun 
control struggle can turn into a rational effort to agree on moderate, sensible 

firearms regulations. 
                                                                                                                            common law felons were ﬁcivilly dead,ﬂ having lost all rights including the right to possess property of 
any kind.  
See Kates & Cramer,

note 61.

seek.  See Barnett & Kates, 
supra note 18, at 1254Œ59 (providing supporting quotations and examples).
