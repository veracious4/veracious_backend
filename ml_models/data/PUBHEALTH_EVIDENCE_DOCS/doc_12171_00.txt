 Plano West is one of the best schools in nation due to its outstanding student performance and test scores.
 The school is also conveniently located in a mid-size metropolitan area, Plano, TX, which is also located to many shops and restaurant.
 As a result, student life is over the top!
 The only thing I would change is the performance of sports.
 Plano west’s sports teams aren’t the best but improvement is always possible in the near future.

 My child struggles significantly with Dyslexia and ADHD.
 They have worked with him tremendously, remained in contact with me, and adjusted his schedule to tackle his hardest classes at times when he is able to focus most.
 This school is absolutely amazing!
 They're also very strict on bullying.
 No tolerance.
 \nThe 504 coordinator is especially helpful and kind, which is very important to my situation.
 So sad we will be leaving this district.

 I was able to grow from a timid 6th grader into the mature and intelligent 8th I am today.
 I credit my success in academics towards the excellent teachers I had in my middle school.
 In my opinion, if anything could be changed, it would be the flight-time periods, as most students do not use their time wisely and not much productivity is occurring.
 Most importantly, thank you, Fowler, for the great 3 years you have given me that laid the foundation for my high school years.

 The teachers over-extend themselves everyday to ensure every student has equal opportunity to succeed, and will never deny a request for tutoring.
 The rigor of the academics can be taxing, but it ultimately pays off come higher institutions.
 In addition to the academic side, it's a comfortable social environment full of kind, humorous, and dedicated people who value and cherish friendships.
 In terms of a private school, they are about all one can ask for in terms of extracurriculars, as recent success in sports ranging from basketball, football, and even dance illustrates such.

 Because I’m an international student, I was really afraid of not being accepted\u002Ftreated badly.
 For my luck, this did not happen.
 Everybody treats me well and I can count on my friends\u002Fschool staff when I need help.\nSome things that might be considered bad but weren’t a problem to me: there is no space for sports, most of the learning is through the computer (of course there’s always a teacher to help you in case you need it) and the school is really small (\u003C200)\nI think that Yorktown prepares the students really well for college, since the school is really small the teachers can give more time and attention for those who need it.\nIn my opinion one of the most interesting things about this school is how involved the staff is with personalized teaching.
 It’s a great school for those who have trouble learning.

 After just a few months of switching to Einstein, she went from feeling sick every day to actually wanting to go to school every day.
 She felt a lot of respect from her teachers and respected them greatly.

 I was promoted within a year of working in a retail store to out in the field as an on-call technician.
 Great management, flexibility, tution assistance and benefits were great!
 They really teach you how to be great at customer service.
 They also groom you for management if they see potential.
 Free movies and popcorn!
 And you get half off of all the food when you’re on the clock.
 They offer raised based off you job performance every 6 months as well.
 It’s an overall great workplace, you just have to watch out for the managers that play favorites and the employees that don’t have your back.
 I believe no job you are going to love everything about, not even your dream job.
 I’ve worked for the company since I was 16 years old, now I’m 21 so about 5 years and when I’m not in school I continue to go back on breaks.
 Great first job and part-time.
 Honestly nothing really bad to say about the company, although I do wish the company had scholarships for fellow college students.
 Would be an awesome plus!
