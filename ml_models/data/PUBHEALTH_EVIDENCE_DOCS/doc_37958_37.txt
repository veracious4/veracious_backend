So to sign-off my recent blogs on ice cream, I just thought I would share this most unusual ice cream flavour with readers.
 No, I didn't get around to trying it myself (I promise you), but this is what it looks like if you are ever in the wonderful cosmopolitan Dutch city of Amsterdam.
 The Stoner's Cookbook at: http://www.thestonerscookbook.com/recipe/marijuana-ice-creamÂ  gives you an easy to make recipe for Cannabis Ice Cream, if you want to try it at home.
 Your writing would sell it fast.
 You have a lot of writing talent.
