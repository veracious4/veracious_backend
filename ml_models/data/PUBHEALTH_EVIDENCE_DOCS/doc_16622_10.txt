 But \"the Florida Legislature moved a modest bill that is addressing some of our concerns.\"In particular, the bill lawmakers passed states that if a utility cannot demonstrate that it plans to complete the construction of the nuclear plant, it will no longer be allowed to collect money.

 But the city's only option is to hope a developer invests in renovating it.
 If the owner applied for permission to demolish it based on the fact that it can't be developed at a reasonable cost, the city would rule to allow or disallow it.
 Tong markets himself on the Internet as a spiritual healer who \"has the ability to travel in the past or future to observe occurrences\" that aid in making predictions.
 A previous owner has replaced the plumbing and wiring and updated some of the 66 rooms.

 If the governor signs it as expected, it could draw a lawsuit and be thrown out.
 It passed on a 68-48 vote, 12 votes short of two-thirds in the 120-member chamber.

 The governor would not comment but his staff, as well as several local government officials, told the Times/Herald that they don't anticipate a legal challenge.
