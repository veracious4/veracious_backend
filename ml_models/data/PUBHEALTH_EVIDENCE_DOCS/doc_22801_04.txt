The number of adults 18Œ64 years old 
without health insurance is high and 
continues to rise. 
1. More adults 18Œ64 years old went 
without health insurance than ever 
before.
 About 1 in 4 adults this age (about 50 mil-lion) reported not having health insurance 
for at least part of the past 12 months. About 1 in 6 adults this age (about 30 mil-lion) went without health insurance for 
the past 12 months or longer. During each of the past few years, the number 
of adults this age who went without health 
insurance for at least part of the past 12 
months increased by an average of 1.1 million.
 More than half of adults this age without 
health insurance for more than the past 12 months had no usual source of medical care.2. Adults 18Œ64 years old  who have a chronic illness and who do not have 
health insurance are more likely to skip 
or delay medical care because of cost.  40% of the entire US population has one or 
more chronic illnesses. Currently insured adults this age with a 
chronic illness who recently had even a short 
gap in health insurance coverage were 3 times 
as likely to skip medical care because of cost 
compared to those continuously insured. More than 40% of adults this age without health insurance in the past 12 months who had high blood pressure, asthma, or diabetes 
reported in 2009 that they had skipped care 
because of cost. Delays in health care can lead to poorer 
health and higher medical costs over time.3.
 Adults 18Œ64 years old with a disability 
skipped or delayed some medical care 
in the past 12 months because of cost.
 Almost 1 in 4 (46 million) adults this age in 
the US have a disability. About 30% of adults this age with a disability 
reported in 2009 that they had no health insurance in the past 12 months. Overall, disabled persons were about twice 
as likely as those with no disability to skip 
or delay medical care.  About 60% of adults 
this age with a disability who had recent 
gaps in the past 12 months in their insurance 
skipped or delayed medical care, compared 
with only 16% for those with continuous 
insurance coverage. 3ALAZARCACOCTFLGAILINIAKSKYLAMEMIMNMSMONENHNYNCNDOHOKORPASCSDTNTXUTVTVAD.C.WAWVWIIDMTNVNMWYHIAKRIMANJDEMD6.2%Œ13.8%13.9%Œ21.4%21.5Œ29.1%Percentage of adults 18Œ64 years old who skipped or

94% of people below 65 years old (an additional 
32 million people) by 2019. 
 Can reduce skipped or delayed care because 
people are less likely to have gaps in insurance. Requires insurance plans to cover and not 

charge co-payments for effective preventive 
services. Greater use of these services could 
save 100,000 lives each year. 
Everyone can Get healthy. Eat less sugar, salt and saturated 
fats and more fruits and vegetables. Walk 30 minutes a day. Quit smoking, or don™t start. Stay healthy. Take any medicines your doctor

Go see your main health care provider. Your primary care doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant can make sure that you

as immunizations, as well as cholesterol, mental 
health, and cancer screenings. Also, they can

employees that include physical activity and 
other wellness measures. Provide options that make health insurance 
and health care easier to afford for employees.  

These options should include basic primary 
care and prevention.Health care providers can
 Include at least some preventive care at each patient visit.  Support the use of retail sites, schools, churches, 
and community centers to make it more conve-nient for people to get basic primary care and 

prevention, including vaccinations.
Health insurance plans can Promote healthy diet and physical activity for 
their enrollees. Adults who are overweight or 
have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or 
diabetes are more likely to have higher health 

care costs. Provide basic primary care and prevention services in more convenient locations such as 
retail sites, schools, churches, and community 

centers.    www
