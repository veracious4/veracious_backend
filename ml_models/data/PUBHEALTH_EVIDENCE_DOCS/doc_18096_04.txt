The Department’s EEO Staff and DOJ Pride have been working together to plan a terrific LGBT Pride Month observance, which is scheduled for June 18 at 11:00 a.m.  To complement this effort, DOJ Pride has developed a new resource for managers.
 The attached brochure – “LGBT Inclusion at Work:  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Managers” – was drafted with input from key Department stakeholders.
 We hope you will find it a useful tool as you work to create an office environment that is welcoming to, and supportive of, all employees, including LGBT employees.
 While the brochure can be viewed online, the format lends itself to double-sided printing on legal size (8 ½ x 14) paper and folding into thirds.
 If anyone wishes to print the brochure, DOJ Pride has attached a “for printing” version that rotates the second page to allow for double-sided printing.Click here to view the LGBT tips for managers brochure.Click here to view the printable version of LGBT tips for managers brochure.
