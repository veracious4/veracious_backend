 They also limited visits to their clinics to help prevent the spread of the virus.They now have more confidence that their intensive care units will be not be overwhelmed by an onslaught of coronavirus patients, though maintaining adequate supplies of personal protective gear, such as gloves and masks, remains a concern.Despite that growing confidence, the resumption of elective procedures and other services will take place gradually, they say.
 Share Your Story: We want to talk to doctors, nurses and others affected by coronavirus“It’s very fluid because we need to look at all the indicators and make sure we are balancing the needs of our kids, the safety of our employees, the safety of the kids and their families,” said Peggy Troy, the president and CEO of Children’s Wisconsin.Children's Wisconsin has begun to schedule a backlog of 1,500 surgeries that were postponed.Children’s Wisconsin also estimates that 20,000 primary care visits have been canceled since the COVID-19 pandemic began affecting nearly every facet of daily life.It now is rescheduling those visits, giving priority to 14,000 children who need immunizations or urgent care.The emergency department at its hospital in Wauwatosa has seen as few as 50 to 60 patients a day, down from about 200 a day typically.
 “This activation is going to be a slow turning of the dial.”ProHealth Care plans to resume elective procedures on Wednesday but said that its plan will depend on the infection rate as well as its ability to test for COVID-19 and obtain sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves.Froedtert Health has slowly begun doing elective procedures, giving priority to patients who need immediate care, said Cathy Jacobson, president and CEO of the health system.It also has begun seeing patients in its clinics who need care, such as diagnostic tests, and who cannot be seen through virtual, or video, visits.Ascension Wisconsin said it plans to begin a phased and measured resumption of services for certain non-urgent and medically necessary procedures as well as primary and specialty care clinic appointments next week.
 The timing will proceed in stages.“Although COVID-19 is still in our communities, we understand individuals in our local communities have emergency and health care needs outside of COVID-19, many of which cannot be delayed or deferred without serious health risks,” Bernie Sherry, the ministry market executive for Ascension Wisconsin, said in a statement.Every health system said this is a concern.“People cannot defer their health care,” Jacobson said.Visits to Froedtert Health's emergency departments, for example, are down 50%.Tests and virtual check-insThe health systems are putting in place an array of precautions to protect patients and staff.
 Patients will be tested for COVID-19 before surgery.
 And they will be screened and must wear a mask for clinic visits.At Aurora, appointments will be staggered and patients will be asked to check in virtually when they are 30 minutes away and when they arrive.
 They also will be asked to remain in their cars until they receive a text asking them to come in.The health systems will continue to provide virtual, or video, visits.Advocate Aurora has provided almost 100,000 virtual visits in Illinois and Wisconsin since the start of the COVID-19 crisis.
 And Children’s Wisconsin provided 15,000 virtual visits, including 3,000 for behavioral health, from mid-March to the end of April.“What we have found is patients love it,” said Jacobson of Froedtert Health.All of the health systems have continued to perform surgeries and provide other care that could not be delayed.
 For example, Children’s Wisconsin has been doing about 20 surgeries a day system-wide, down from about 80 a day before the decision to postpone elective procedures.Troy was confident that Children’s Wisconsin will work its way through the backlog of postponed surgeries.“If we have to go to seven days a week, we are all about that,” she said.
 “We will do that.”Every child will be tested for COVID-19 before surgery.Children’s Wisconsin can process 300 to 400 tests a day, though obtaining the needed supplies remains a challenge.
 Advocate Aurora and Froedtert Health also said that they have significantly increased the number of tests that they can process.Troy also stressed that Children’s Wisconsin will move forward cautiously.“Our whole philosophy around opening up is a measured and gradual approach,” she said.Advocate Aurora and other health systems are doing the same.“It is not returning to business as usual,” said Gary Stuck, chief medical officer of Advocate Aurora.
