 The Brady Law imposed as an interim measure a waiting period of 5 days before a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer may sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to an unlicensed individual.
 The waiting period applies only in states without an acceptable alternate system of conducting background checks on handgun purchasers.
 The interim provisions of the Brady Law became effective on February 28, 1994, and ceased to apply on November 30, 1998.
 While the interim provisions of the Brady Law apply only to handguns, the permanent provisions of the Brady Law apply to all firearms.
