 An ABC15 analysis of state campaign finance data -- since Oct. 1 -- shows more than $2.2 million has been spent against Proposition 205, which would legalize recreational marijuana if passed in November.
 On the other side, only $24,000 has been spent in support of Prop.
 205 so far this month.Discount Tire is the largest anti-pot contributor, with a $1 million contribution on Oct. 12.
 Take a look at who else has donated both for and against Prop.
