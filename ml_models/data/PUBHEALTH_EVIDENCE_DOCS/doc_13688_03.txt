 "How do you lie to people who lost their kids in the face?"
 he asked, referring to the response of the Obama administration after four Americans died when a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked in 2012.
 "That alone disqualifies her to be (president) to me," Beruff told a crowd of about 40 at a West Pasco Republicans Club banquet at the Heritage Springs Country Club.

 The dramatics of Washington and Tallahassee often overshadow the work of local government, but City Hall is where the decisions are made that have the greatest impact on people’s daily lives.
 It’s my job to keep it interesting so more people stay engaged with their community.
 I’m also on the Tampa Bay Times’ hurricane team, and have been deployed to report on the aftermaths of three storms: Hermine in 2016, Irma in 2017 and Michael in 2018.
 I find serenity in following recipes, the more complicated the better.
 I’m a bourbon fan, an amatuer pizza critic and a Pinellas Trail bike rider.
 Otherwise I like watching YouTube and talking on the phone.
 I’m proudly from New Jersey, don’t @ me for it — or do, it won’t matter.
 I came to the Times in 2014 after graduating from Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism.

 Overall, the effort was defeated 89-50, according to a final Tuesday tally.
 In Flores' and Harrison's districts, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans.
 A Public Policy Polling survey released last week found that 83 percent of Floridians support such a ban.
 While he couldn't be reached for comment, one of his Democratic opponents, Rena Frazier, criticized his vote against the session.
 Reps. Katie Edwards, D-Plantation, and Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, D-Tallahassee, voted against a special session, too.
 Amanda Murphy, D-New Port Richey, didn't vote, according to Department of State records, though she said she sent in her vote Tuesday.
 She intended to vote against a special session.
 Twenty other lawmakers skipped the vote.
 Among them was Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, who has blocked legislation pushed by pro-gun groups like the National Rifle Association in the past.

 Facing a tough re-election battle, Harrison was one of only three Republican lawmakers to vote in favor of a special session that would have considered legislation that would ban people on terrorist watch lists from buying guns.
 Gray also filed a complaint with the state.
 A yearlong state investigation of the complaint found Gray's most serious allegations to be unsubstantiated.
 The development corporation did repay the state $846.09 in improperly spent money — $810 to buy Walmart gift cards for 27 graduates of a program for at-risk girls and $36.09 for a staff lunch with a new hire.
 The race is on the Aug. 30 primary ballot, and a runoff will be held Nov. 8 if no candidate receives more than half the votes cast.
 He said the discrimination lawsuit is \"in suspense\" and he could revive it.
 Court dockets show two closed lawsuits, both labeled discrimination complaints — one voluntarily dismissed by Gray and the other dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can't be refiled.
 He said he couldn't recall details of the encounters without going back through his records.
 He said he was let go when he raised concerns to his boss about misspent grant money.
 He said he left that job to take care of his aging parents.
 He said the real estate crash also hurt his business renting houses.
 It says he worked for seven companies in 12 years after leaving the Marine Corps in 1988 and before moving to Tampa in 2001, where he began a private human resources practice and a real estate investment firm.
 Clendenin wouldn't comment, but said voters should know about all candidates' business and employment histories.
 Clendenin's total includes a $20,000 loan from himself.
 That’s hard to say.
