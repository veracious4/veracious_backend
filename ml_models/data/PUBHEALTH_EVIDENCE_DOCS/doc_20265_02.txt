 Subscribe to OregonLive.PoliticsDwight Holton leads in fundraising against Ellen Rosenblum in Oregon Attorney General race -- with a little help from East Coast friendsUpdated Jan 10, 2019; Posted Apr 11, 2012 Facebook ShareTwitter ShareBy       Jeff Manning | The Oregonian/OregonLive      View full sizeDwight Holton's race against Ellen Rosenblum for Oregon Attorney General shows his strong financial support from old East-Coast friends.On March 13, Oregon Attorney General candidate Dwight Holton was engaged in a painful preoccupation of anyone running for office -- he was raising money.But Holton's fundraiser was not at a West Hills manse or Portland hotel ballroom.
 It was at the home of his long-time friend, Virginia hedge fund managerNicholas Perrins.
 The event raised $25,000, continuing what has been a steady influx of East-Coast money into Holton's campaign coffers.Holton has raised $419,066, as of March 10, more than 60 percent from out-of-state.
 Many of his contributors are high-level beltway Democrats, likePaul BegalaandJohn Podesta, whom Holton befriended working for theMichael Dukakiscampaign and for the Clinton administration.The out-of-state money has enabled Holton to stretch his fundraising lead over his opponent, former Oregon Appeals Court Judge Ellen Rosenblum.
 She's raised $289,595, 72 percent from Oregon.
 "Dwight has access to these deep political pockets that Ellen doesn't," said Rosenblum spokeswoman Cynara Lilly.Until midnight Tuesday, candidates could take up to 30 days to report contributions.
 But from now until the May 15 primary, they have just seven days to reveal each financial transaction.
 The switch launched a flurry of reporting this week, providing a wealth of data on statewide and local races.Rosenblum argues that the candidates' divergent donor bases are relevant to the race.
 Sounding a recurring theme of hers, Rosenblum claims that Holton's reliance on his East-Coast connections reflect his status as a relatively new arrival to Oregon and a virtual stranger to its state court system.
 "When you've joined the Oregon State Bar in 2009 and you've never set foot in an Oregon courtroom, I'm not sure that qualifies you to be Attorney General," Rosenblum said of Holton.The numbers "demonstrate I'm the Oregon candidate," said Rosenblum, who has worked her entire career here as a lawyer and judge.Dave FrohnmayerandHardy Myers, both former Oregon attorneys general, have endorsed Rosenblum, as has former OregonGov.
 Barbara Roberts.Holton is not the stranger Rosenblum paints him.
 He has lived in Oregon since 2002 and worked as a federal prosecutor in Portland most of the ensuing years.
 Holton handled hundreds of cases in Oregon.
 But virtually all were in federal court.Holton doesn't apologize for his East-Coast fundraising.
 "The fact is, it costs a lot of money to run a campaign," he said.
 "I wish that wasn't the case.
 But because you do, I'm reaching out to people from all facets of my life.
 "Holton grew up in politics.
 His father, Linwood Holton Jr., was governor of Virginia in the early 1970s.
 Though his father was a Republican, Holton jumped into Democratic politics, working for Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign and later for ClintonPeople he met then remember Holton fondly enough to donate to his campaign.Dee Dee Myers, best known as Clinton's former spokeswoman, said she met Holton during the Dukakis campaign "and we've been friends ever since," she said.
 "I think he has a great heart and keen mind -- and is truly committed to public service.
 "Myers contributed $1,000.
 Podesta, Clinton's former chief of staff and now head of left-leaning Washington, D.C., think tankCenter for American Progress, donated $500.
 Begala, now a political consultant and commentator, ponied up $5,000.
 "These are friendships forged in the fire of really hard political fights," Holton said.
 "And those friendships last a long time.Holton points out he's got plenty of local support, including from most Oregon District Attorneys and county sheriffs who have taken a position.
 The Multnomah County Prosecuting Attorneys Association on Tuesday endorsed Holton and contributed a fresh $20,000 to his campaign.In another statewide race, Republican Knute Buehler continues to lead Secretary of State Kate Brown, a Democrat, in fundraising in the race for her seat, although Brown now has nearly as much cash on hand.
 Buehler has raised nearly $460,000 and has almost $200,000 in cash.
 Brown has raised $265,000 and has $170,000 in the bank.-- Jeff ManningNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
