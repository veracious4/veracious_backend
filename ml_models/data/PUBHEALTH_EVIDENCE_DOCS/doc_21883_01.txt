http://www.treasurydirect.gov
. The debt 
limit is codified as 31 U.S.C. 
ยง
3101.

Although there are hundreds of trust funds, the overwhelming majority are very small. The 12 largest
 
trust funds hold 
98.8% of the federal debt held in government accounts. See 
CRS Report R41815, 
Overview of the Federal Debt
, by D. 
Andrew Austin
.

Other means of financing

including cash balance changes, 
seignior
age, and capitalization of financing accounts used 
to fund federal credit programs

have relatively little effect on the changes in debt held by the public.
 
4
 
In future years, when some trust 
funds are projected to pay out more than they take in, funds that the Treasury would 
use to redeem those intergovernmental debts must be obtained via higher taxes or lower government spending.
 
5
 
Trust fund surpluses by law must be invested in special feder
al government securities.
 
6
 
See Office of Management and Budget, 
FY2016 Budget, Historical Tables
, Table 7.1.

The ability to run fiscal deficits gives the federal government useful flexibility in managing its finances, although 
large deficits may 
eventua
lly 
harm economic performance. See 
CRS Report RL33657,

Pitfalls

.
 
As more of the baby boom generation retires, Social Security benefits have come closer to levels of 
Social Security pay
roll taxes, which has slowed the accumulation of intragovernmental debt.

government debt of allied (i.e., Entente) countries, which would have complicated limits on
 
the final redemption of 
federal bonds issued to fund their purchase. Some federal bonds issued in the wake of the Panic of 1893 did not have 
maturity limits.

Middleton Beaman, a former Law Librarian of the Library of Congress, Columbia Law School professor, and 
advocate for the professionalization of drafting legislation, returned to Washington in 1916 to assist the House Ways 
and Means Committee, which origin
ated the Liberty Bond acts and other borrowing and revenue measures. This 
arrangement was formalized in 1918, when the Legislative Drafting Service, the predecessor office of the modern 
Office of Legislative Counsel, was established. Donald R. Kennon and R

In
creases in the debt limited potentially enabled by the Budget Control Act of 2011 are counted as one alteration.
 
It is 
difficult to classify all of those modifications unambiguously as increases. For example, some debt limit measures 
extended temporary deb
t limit increases that would have lapsed. 
 
47
 
Until 2001, Treasury publications did not divide debt subject to limit by that held by the public and that held by 
government accounts 
Table 
1
 
uses CRS calculations that approximate levels of debt subject to limit held in these two 
categories for fiscal years prior to 2001.
 
48
 
The data show components of debt compared to the size of the economy. This avoids possi
ble distortions resulting 
from changing price levels over time and includes changes in per capita incomes. This percentage increases when debt 
grows faster than GDP and falls when it grows more slowly than GDP.

Notes:
 
Amounts held by government accounts and held by the public for FY1996
-
FY2000 are approximated. In 
2001, the Treasury publications began distinguishing holders of debt subject to limit. The numbers in the table 
s
howing this breakdown for FY1996 through FY2000 were calculated by subtracting debts of the Federal 
Financing Bank, an arm of the Treasury whose debt is subject to a separate limit, from intragovernmental debt. 
This calculation overestimates debt by billio
ns of dollars because estimates of unamortized discount are 
unavailable. This adjusted amount was then subtracted from total debt subject to limit for an approximate 
measure of debt held by the public subject to limit. Because intragovernmental debt is ove
restimated, debt held 
by the public is underestimated. Totals may not sum due to rounding
. 
Debt at the end of FY2015 was held $25 
million below its limit.

reduced the amount of debt held by selected federal accounts while it sold an equal (or smaller) amount 
of debt to the public. This raised cash needed to pay for ongoing obligations and kept the debt below the limit.

Sequestration is a mechanism that directs the President to cancel budget authority or other forms of budgetary 
resources in order to reach specified budget reduction targets. Balanced Bud
get and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 
1985 (
P.L. 99
-
177
), often known as Gramm
-
Rudman
-
Hollings (GRH), introduced sequestration procedures into the 
federal budget process. T
hose sequestration procedures were modified in subsequent years to address separation of 
powers issues and other concerns. For details, see

limit. The U.S. Treasury pays interest to Social Security and certain other trust funds in the form of Treasury securities 
at the end of June and December, whi
ch increases debt subject to limit.

That measure passed the Senate on an 81
-
18 vote. The House then passed the measure on a 285
-
144 vote. The 
President signed the bill (
P.L. 113
-
46
) on October 17, 2013. The measure suspended the debt limit until February 8, 
2014, once the President certified that the U.S. Treasury would be unable to meet existing commitments without 
issuing debt. The Presidential 
certification was subject to a disapproval resolution. The debt limit provisions are 
included as Sec. 1002 of P.L. 113
