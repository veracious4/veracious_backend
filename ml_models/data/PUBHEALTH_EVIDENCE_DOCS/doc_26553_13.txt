 Professor Emeritus Rutgers UniversityEOHSI – Clinical Research and Occupational Medicine  Work EOHSI Room 206 170 Frelinghuysen Rd Piscataway NJ 08854 work  Work Phone: 848-445-6083work   Work Email: gochfeld@eohsi.rutgers.eduINTERNET      Biographical Info Research Areas My main area of research has focused on heavy metals exposure and effect.
 The current emphasis is on the relationship between mercury and selenium exposure and balancing the risks against benefits of fish consumption.
 Much of this work involves Native American and Alaskan Native communities.
 A second area focuses on the environmental consequences of energy options, examining nuclear options in the light of the spent nuclear fuel impasse and the Fukushima disaster vs unintended consequences of renewable energy.
 This has been developed as an outgrowth of our CRESP work on hazardous waste, risk management, and land use decisions with the U.S. Department of Energy.
 A third area focuses on incorporating workplace health and safety equity into the EPA’s “Environmental Justice” paradigm.
 Research Highlights  Participation in an EPA Environmental Justice Symposium resulted in exploration of the importance of outliers in risk management and the importance of occupational exposures as part of a comprehensive Environmental Justice paradigm.
 The role of selenium in protecting against mercury toxicity has been known for 40 years, but the mechanism(s) of the interaction remain unclear.
 This study examines whether the Se:Hg molar ratio predicts mercury toxicity from fish consumption.
