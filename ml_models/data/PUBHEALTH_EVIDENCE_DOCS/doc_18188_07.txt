Introduction
 
The Florida 
Legislature commissioned Spectrum Gaming Group to undertake a three
-
party 
study of legalized gambling, focusing on its economic effects (including the social costs). This 
report, the first in the series, is divided into two primary parts:
 

 
The first provide
s overviews of many aspects of gambling generally, both nationally 
and as they pertain to Florida (as relevant). Because this part consists of summaries of 
existing data and research, we have not summarized the content in this Executive 
Summary.
 

 
The second
 

stands now 

 
including the Florida Lottery, the pari
-
mutuel industry including slot 
machines and cardrooms, and Indian casinos. We provide the key performance data by 
sector and, 
working in concert with project partner Regional Economic Models Inc. 

key findings are provided below in this Executive Summary.
 
This report is the product of a far
-
reachin
g scope of research and analysis. In many respects, 
it is a collection of several reports. We have provided a detailed Table of Contents that allows 
readers to easily find the topics of greatest interest to them.
 
While reading this report, it is important 

instructions:
 

 
Spectrum will 
not 
make recommendations
 
in any of its reports. The Legislature 
commissioned Spectrum to undertake an economic and academic study for the purpose 

d other stakeholders so that they may make 
enlightened decisions regarding the future of gambling in their state.
 

 
This is the first of three reports
 
due to the Legislature. The two additional reports will 
be delivered by Spectrum on or before October 1, 20
13, are as follows: Part 1, Section 
B: 
Assessment of potential changes and economic effects
; and Part 2: 
Statistical 
relationships between gaming and economic variables for communities.
 

 
Spectrum was tasked with 
analyz
ing the social costs associated with ga
mbling in the 
second report
. While this initial report provides a discussion of the many social costs 
of gambling, in Part 1B, as part of our next report, we will determine the costs as they 
relate to expanded gambling in Florida.

sectors 

 
pari
-
mutuel (including the subsectors of slots, cardrooms and pari
-
mutuel wagering) 
lottery, and Indian casinos.
 
Pari
-
Mutuel
 
Three distinct types of gambli

-
mutuel 
industry, only one of which actually involves pari
-
mutuel wagering. Because state
-
regulated slot 
machines and cardrooms must be coupled with a pari
-
mutuel license, these activities are offered 
only 
at racetracks and jai alai frontons. All three types of gambling are regulated by the Division 
of Pari
-
Mutuel Wagering, a unit of the Department of Business & Professional Regulation.
 
Racetrack Slots
 

 
The racetrack slot industry
 
(i.e., racinos)
, which is le
gally restricted to Broward and 
Miami
-
Dade counties, has steadily grown since inception in 2006. The six racinos in 
2012 reported gross slot revenue of $489.2 million and are set for continued growth 
with the opening of slots at Hialeah Park in summer 2013
. 
 

 
The racinos in 2012 had 3,319 employees and generated $149.8 million in taxes directly 
from slot revenue. Gross slot revenue is taxed at 35 percent.
 
Cardrooms
 

 
Twenty
-
four pari
-
mutuel facilities operate cardrooms, which are restricted to poker and 
domino
es (which is rarely offered or played).
 
Cardrooms last year generated $131 
million gross receipts and paid a tax of $13.1 million.
 

 
Cardrooms pay a state tax of 10 percent on gross receipts. Additionally, at jai alai and 
greyhound facilities 4 percent of ca
rdroom gross receipts are used to fund purses and 
player awards; the figure is 50 percent at horse race facilities. 
 
Pari
-
Mutuel Wagering
 
Most pari
-
mutuel facilities lose money on their pari
-
mutuel operations and need 
cardroom and/or casino revenue to 
subsidize those losses.
 
It is important to note that the total handle numbers cited below are understated because 
the Division of Pari
-
Mutuel Wagering does not collect data on out
-
of
-
state generated 
handle, which is the single largest component of handle.
 

 
Greyhound racing: 
Total handle for the 13 facilities that ran greyhound racing fell from 
$933.8 million in FY 1990 to $265.4 million in FY 2012, a decline of 67 percent 

 
mirroring the decline nationally.
 
The number of Florida greyhound performances (a 
rac
ing card of at least eight races) fell from 3,853 to 3,636, a decline of only 6 percent. 
One of the reasons for the relatively small decline is because of the 90 percent rule: 
  
 
Florida Gaming Study, Part 1
-
A 
                                                              
xi
 
 
Operators with cardrooms are required to conduct at least 90 percent of the live
 
performances that were held the year before their cardrooms opened, which for many 
of them was 1996. Although attendance has declined precipitously since 1990, reliable 
figures are unavailable because most tracks no longer charge for admission.
 

 
Thoroughbred racing:
 
Thoroughbred racing is the dominant pari
-
mutuel sector in 
Florida, with the three tracks accounting for 61 percent of total Florida handle in FY 
2012. A Florida thoroughbred operator must run a minimum of 40 performances a year. 
From F
Y 1990 to FY 2012, Florida thoroughbred performances fell from 348 to 327, a 
decline of 6 percent; paid attendance fell from 653,206 to 97,738, a decline of 85 
percent. Total handle in FY 2012 was $530.7 million and live handle was $78.6 million; 
both figu
res are in decline, although they have somewhat stabilized since slots were 
introduced at two of the tracks. Purses increased from $78.1 million to $81.1 million, 
a rise of 16 percent. The three tracks generated a combined operating profit of $13 
million f
or FY 2012. Much of the profit, $10.6 million, came from pari
-
mutuel 
operations, with the rest from slots and/or cardrooms.
 

 
Harness racing:
 

accounted for 5 percent of total Florida handle in 
FY 2012. The Pompano track must 
run at least 140 performances a year but it can seek a one
-
time, 10 percent reduction 
from the 140
-
performance minimum. Attendance has declined such that Isle Pompano 
no longer charges admission and attendance figures are no
t kept. Total handle in FY 
2012 was $49.5 million and live handle was $4.4 million; both figures are about the 
same as the year earlier.
 

 
Quarter horse racing:
 
Quarter horse racing returned to Florida in November 2009 at 
Hialeah Park after an 18
-
year absenc
e. Quarter horse racing (inclusive of barrel racing) 
accounted for less than 1 percent of total Florida handle in FY 2012. Quarter horse 
racing had 76 performances in FY 2012. It generated 
a live handle of $1.7 million, total 
handle of $2.1 million and pur
ses of $3.8 million. Almost all of the traditional quarter 
horse activity was at Hialeah, where the operator subsidized purses as part of its 
contract with horsemen. 
 

 
Jai alai:
 
Of all the pari
-
mutuel sectors, jai alai has sustained the steepest cuts in 
att
endance and popularity. Since 1990, total handle has fallen 91 percent, live handle 
96 percent, player awards 63 percent and performances, 63 percent. In 1990, 3.9 million 
people paid to watch the sport. In 2012, total paid attendance was 9,068. From pari
-
mutuel operations, the jai alai sector sustained an operating loss of $14 million. Their 
cardrooms were able to generate an operating profit of $1 million. Miami Jai Alai had 
the highest handle at $6.6 million in FY 2012.

Lottery
 
The Florida Lottery repo
rted FY 2012 sales of a record $4.45 billion, up 11 percent over 
the previous year, ranking 
third in the nation
 
in total sales revenue 
(FY 2011), behind New York 
(including its video gaming machine revenue) 
and Massachusetts.
 
On a per
-
capita basis, Lottery
 
sales were $233, also a state record.
 
Since its inception in 1988, the Lottery has provided a total of $24 billion to the Educational 

for construction bonds, prov
ided $271 million for public school funding, $130 million for state 
colleges, and $254 million for state universities. Since 1997 the
 
Florida Lottery
 
has also provided 
scholarships to more than 600,000 students through the Bright Futures Scholarship Progra
m, 
funded primarily through Lottery financial transfers. Lottery tickets are sold at 13,300 retail 
locations throughout the state.
 
Indian Casinos
 
The Seminole Tribe of Florida operates seven casinos
,
 
and the Miccosukee Tribe operates 
one casino. The Semino
le Tribe advised Spectrum that in 2012 its gaming facilities employed 
9,562 total employees, or 7,725 full
-
time
-
equivalent employees
 
(

FTEs

)
. Another 4,000 are 
employed by Seminole casino facility tenants, such as retailers who operate on
-
site outlets. The 
Miccosukee Tribe declined to cooperate with this study, 
al
though a Miccosukee Gaming & Resort 
employee advised Spectrum that its gaming pro

 
The Seminole Gaming enterprise generated $1.96 billion in GGR in 2012 at its properties, 
and we estimate statewide GGR at Indian casinos to be $2.2 billion.
 
At least two other Indian tribes/nations are trying to operate casinos in
 
Florida:
 

 
The Poarch Band of Creek Indians, based in Atmore, AL, has land in Escambia County, 
which is held in trust by the US government, and also owns, or has options to own, or 
agreements to control 10 pari
-
mutuel permits along the Interstate 10 corrido
r between 
Pensacola and Jacksonville. The Poarch Band said it is seeking to negotiate an 
agreement, which could include revenue
-
sharing, with the State to operate Class II 
gaming.
 

 
For the past decade the Muscogee Nation of Florida has been pursuing federal
 
recognition by act of Congress in order to initiate gaming operations as a means of 
economic development. Tribal landholdings are well positioned to offer casino gaming 
in the Florida panhandle.

The study of gambling

 
economic and
 
social
 
impacts is 
a never
-
end
ing process that will 
only grow
 
more
 
critical 
over time
: Some form of gambling is legal in 48 states
,
 
and
 
debates over 
gambling expansion 
seem to be
 
an annual event 
at 
statehouses
 
across the country
. Moreover,
 
the 
effective legalization of Internet gambling at the state level has magnified 
such
 
debates
. 
At the 
same time
, illegal and/or unregulated gambling is 
proliferating through such channels as so
-
called 
Internet cafes, gray
-
market electronic gaming devices, skill games, 
amusement games, and online 
games.
 
A majority of American adults are gamblers
. 
Some 53 percent played the lottery last year 
and 32 percent 
gambl
ed
 
in a casino.
1
 
As gambling historian David G. Schwartz notes, the activity 
is
 
nearly
 
as old as civilization itself. 
In America, colonial legislatures authorized 157 lotteries from 
the 1740s through 1776 to assist governments and other institutions.
2
 
Legalized gambling as we know it today is relatively young. The first legal casinos
 
of 
the 
modern era
 

1964. Betting on horse rac
es
 
has a 
longer history, dating to 
colonial d
ays
 
in 
America
 
but grew 
rapidly 
after the Civil War
.
3
 
Although
 
popular in one form or another
, gambling remains controversial. On the one 
hand, regulated gambling can provide substantial revenues to governments and, in many markets, 
a substantial number of
 
direct, indirect and induced jobs; on the other hand, it can lead to 
compulsions that result in financial, familial and mental
-
health costs
,
 
as well as governmental costs 
ranging from gambling
-
addi
c
tion treatment centers to
 
additional
 
law enforcement
. The
 
arguments 
on both sides are strong 

 
and 
usually
 
impassioned.
 
This report will not resolve 
the debate over the merits of legalized gambling
, nor is it
 
the 
assignment
 
of Spectrum Gaming Group
 
to attempt to do so
 
(
n
or has the Florida Legislature
 
tasked 
Spec
trum with
 
recommend
ing
 
any course of action
)
.
 
Rather, the Legislature commissioned an 
economic and academic study 
for the purpose of educating
 

may make enlightened decisions regarding the future of gambling in their st
ate.
 
This analysis relies on the experience of Spectrum professionals in various disciplines, 
many of whom have studied this issue for decades, and is supported by additional research and 
interviews with numerous stakeholders in Florida who care deeply abo
ut this issue, and about the

future of their state. Our experience is tempered and governed by certain observations and 
principles:
 

 
The gaming industry is uniquely intertwined with government, 
arguably as much as
 
any 
other industry, particularly any indust
ry that is dependent on discretionary spending.
 
Government can legislate gaming into 

 
or out of 

 
existence, which underscores this 
relationship.
 

 
Gaming is a privilege granted to those who meet affirmative obligations for 
demonstrating their good 
character, honesty and integrity. That principle is largely 
universal, and is shared by federal, state and tribal governments.
 

 
Governments not only authorize legalized gambling, but often grant regional 
monopolies for operators. The corollary to that is th
at operators have a responsibility to 
operate in 
the public interest.
 

 
With proper planning and coordination, the public and private sectors are more likely to 
identify common goals, and to achieve those goals.

In each section of the report, we provide the relevant 
ITN
 
language (
highlighted in gray
) 
to provide an understanding of the scope of research with which Spectrum was tasked for this first 
report.
 
Our task was to study
 
the impacts of legalized gambling. Like many other states, Florida 
had (and perhaps still has) illegal and/or unregulated gaming in the form of Internet cafes and slot
-
like arcade games. While we discuss the nature and issues involving such gambling, it i
s beyond 
the scope of this study to examine its performance and impacts.
 
Many of the topics covered herein are worthy of 
their own reports
, but the broad, multi
-
subject scope 
of 
this report 

 



 
limits the extent 
to which we could reasonably treat 
such topics
. 
It is important to
 
note, however, 
that 
in

depth analysis of several topics will be provided in the second and third reports
 
of

We relied on publicly available data, 
as well as 
data requested from gambling operators
 
and government sources
, interviews with various Florida 
stakeholders (both in person

A general description of gambling in terms of popularity, profi
tability, regulatory considerations, and cost 
mitigation, including not only industries currently operating in Florida but also other gambling activities 
such as table games, 
Internet
 
poker, destination resort casinos, and sports betting.
 
A.
 
Growth and Evolut
ion of Gambling in United States
 
Florida is not an emerging gam
bl
ing state. In terms of revenue, employment, number of 
gaming locations and other important measures, 
it
 
already
 
is
 
a major gam
bl
ing state, with a wide 
array of options.
 
Florida is arguably a 
microcosm of US gaming, with all of the forces that are 
shaping the industry in other states at play here. Absent a plan for growth, these forces will 
continue unabated in shaping the industry in both Florida and elsewhere. Moreover, the presence 
of such f
orces will also constrict the ability of lawmakers to chart the future of gaming. These 
forces can be segmented into the following broad areas:
 

 
Legal
: 
Within the bounds of the state Constitution and federal law, the Florida 
Legislature has significant ability to craft its own laws and policies. The boundaries that 
limit legislative authority, however, are significant. 
Florida is bound by
 
a
 
compact with 
t
he Seminole 
T
ribe
 
of Florida
, and th
at
 
compact
 
is
, in turn, bound by federal laws and 
regulations, most notably by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act
 

. Other states, 
such as Connecticut, have found themselves in a similar position, having learned tha
t 
compacts can represent missed opportunities that are difficult to revise after the fact
.
 

 
Market
: As with any gaming jurisdiction, the future size of the gaming industry will be 
partly dependent on the size of the resident population, as well as on the 
size of the 
existing and future tourism markets. Those markets will, in turn, be dependent on the 
number of gaming and other entertainment options, both inside and outside Florida. As 
gaming expands within the home markets of Florida visitors, as well as w
ithin markets 
that compete for those visits, it will impact the growth of gaming in Florida, as well as 
the ability of lawmakers to guide that growth.
 

 
Historic
: The two federally recognized tribes in Florida lay claim to a longstanding 
history of gaming in
 
Florida, as well as other rights and privileges granted to sovereign 
governments. Historic claims to sovereignty are at the root of IGRA and various court 
decisions that have supported and bolstered the concept of
 
sovereignty and gaming 
rights.
 
At the sam
e time, the pari
-
mutuel industry 

 
in particular, horse racing 

 
has a 
long history within the state as well, and extends into various geographic regions and 
economic interests, from breeding and training to racing. This factor is arguably more 
acute in Fl
orida, but is not unprecedented.
 
  
 
Florida Gaming Study, Part 1

A 
                                                              
6
 
 

 
Political
: Among various private industries, gaming is uniquely dependent on the 
p
olitical process for its success
 
and
,
 
in many instances, for its very existence. In Florida, 
as in other states, this essential connection wi
th government and the political process 
means that gaming operators and their allied interests have devoted 

 
and will continue 
to devote 

 
considerable resources toward influencing that process. At the same time, 
other interests that oppose the expansion 
of gaming, for reasons ranging from moral to 
economic, will play a role in that process.
 

 
Technological
: Gaming is hardly immune to changes in technology that are whipsawing 
many industries and changing business models around the world. The development of 
t
he Internet, and offshoots of that, including the expanded use of mobile technologies, 
have created new gaming opportunities, while presenting new challenges for lawmakers 
and regulators. In turn, as other states 

 
and the federal government 

 
adapt their 
own 
gaming laws, it will inevitably have an impact on the future of gaming in Florida.
 

 
Competitive
: 
While s
tates compete against other states
,
 
i
n
-
state competition is
 
also
 
common. 
L
otteries and casinos can view each other as threats (even though arguably 
t
he experience is quite different, as is the demographics of the player base). Similarly, 
within the casino sub
-
sector itself, in
-
state competition can occur, and that can include 
competition for legislative and regulatory attention and resources. In Indian
a, for 

5
 
operate under different rules than the riverboats
. 
For 
example, riverboats are allowed live table games, which are barred from racinos, while 
the tax rates also differ.
 
Additionally, casinos compete against many oth
er industries for 
a share of overall discretionary spending.
 
As these macro trends combine
,
 
a number of smaller yet still significant trends have 
emerged. For example, states that first legalized gaming with slots or video
 
lottery terminals are 
evolving in
to full
-
service casinos, with both slots and table games. In part, this has been facilitated 
by political pressures for more gaming revenue and to create additional employment opportunities, 
but it has also been advanced through technology as well. Various
 
companies, most notably 
Shuffle Master and International Game Technology, have developed popular electronic table 
games that mimic live table games, sometimes with virtual dealers, but can 
be governed like slot 
machines. 
 
That is an example of how politic
al and technological trends can combine to effect changes. 
The technology that created electronic table games was largely unanticipated when slots were 
initially authorized in many states, and as the technology developed, new questions arose, such as: 
Are 
the electronic games tables or slots? 
 
With that in mind, t
his interim step 
of electronic table games 
has made it easier from both 
a management and a government standpoint to take the next step of live table games. Moreover,

a 
widely used 
portmanteau 
formed by the combination of two words, rac
etrack 
and casino.

7
 
 
in such instances, states are o
ften responding to what other states are doing. This has clearly been 
the case with West Virginia first adding 
live 
tables to its slots
-
only mix, followed by Delaware and 
then by Pennsylvania. 
 
Simil
arly, within the private 
sector,
 
various
 
operators are taking advantage of expansion 

markets with a higher gaming tax can feed business to hub properties in destination markets where 
the tax rates a
re generally lower. This trend is explained in more detail later in the report.
 
With these factors combined, Florida is also emblematic of national trends. In
-
state 
competition is intense, not just on a geographic basis, but in terms of fighting for parity
 
on issues 
ranging from the type of offerings allowed to the effective tax rate. Florida is arguably more 
heightened on the competitive front than other states.
 
As 
more than 
one 
stakeholder
 
told us during the course of our research for this study, the 
pari
-
mutuel industry
 

common with their dog
-
racing counterparts, and both have little in common with jai alai. Even 
within horse racing, there are warring camps between those who favor r
acing as the principal line 
of business and those who favor the casino offerings.
 
The various parties that comprise the pari
-
mutuel industry have different agendas as well, 
with some favoring the addition of table games to pari
-
mutuels as the principal goa
l
,
 
with others 
favoring a lower effective tax rate, for example. Pari
-
mutuels will generally find some common 
ground among themselves 


gaming operations, as well as in opposition to Interne
t cafes. Going further, the pari
-
mutuels will 
also find common cause with the tribal operations in their shared opposition to proposals to 
authorize additional destination gaming resorts under a competitive bidding process.
 
On that latter issue, they all f
ind common ground with business interests in the Orlando 
region and others, such as No Casinos, in their uniform opposition to the introduction of new 
destination resorts.
 
Such shifting al
liances and differing agendas are
 
not uncommon within gaming, and 
hi
ghlight
 
two other truisms:
 

 
The status quo always has its adherents, and can make for some unusual political 
bedfellows.
 

 
Gaming will continue to evolve, with or without guidance or planning from public 
officials.
 
The former point is best exemplified by how 
gaming has evolved in different states. For 
example, Nevada 

 
the state that is most dependent on gaming revenues for government operations 

 
has no state lottery
. 
At the same time, 
Internet gambling
 
is just beginning to emerge in the United 
States while i
t is a mature industry in Europe. In both instances, the same explanation applies: 
Those whose interests are tied to the status quo are more likely to resist
 
change
.

8
 
 
That does not mean that the industry will stop changing and evolving. Change will 
continue
, whether public officials play a lead role or not. The factors leading to change, as outlined 
in this section, will not render any effort to develop a gaming policy as moot.
 
In fact, t
he presence 
of these critical factors heightens the need for a comprehe
nsive policy. Based on our research and 
experience in Florida and elsewhere, gaming will evolve in Florida whether or not the Florida 
Legislature develops a plan and puts that plan into action. Absent any plan, however, that evolution 
would be haphazard an
d would be far less likely to address or advance any public
-
policy goals.

How Governments Respond to Gambling Expansion
 
Gaming has been expanding for decades and continues to do so. Even when limits are 
enshrined in the state Constitution, it does not prec
lude serious expansion efforts. Constitutional 
limitations, as well as tribal compacts, can be viewed as obstacles to expansion, but in a real
-
world 
sense, do not serve as permanent barriers
. 
The best example of this can be found in
 
New York, 
where the sta
te constitution prohibits 
commercial gambling, yet it has a highly successful lottery, 
nine racinos and five Indian casinos 

 
all operating through a variety of exemptions, rulings and 
legal interpretations. Today, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is pushi
ng
 
to outright amend 
the state C
onstitution to allow full
-
blown commercial casinos; i.e., those with true slot machines 
(as opposed to video lottery terminals) and live table games.
 

 
report, have 
allowed an expansion of gambling to occur that the Legislature may never have intended. Rulings 

-


f current gaming laws.
 
As Kent Stirling, executive director of the Florida Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective 
Association, told the 
Tampa Bay Times


6
 
At is
sue, for example, is the simple definition of a 
pari
-
mutuel event
. Can it involve just 
two horses or two jai alai players? Does a horse race have to run on a traditional oval? Can a race 
begin with a simple drop of a flag? Can an operator comply with the l
ive racing requirement by 

-
type racing? Can an operator shut down, transfer its live racing dates 
to another facility and then establish an off
-
site simulcasting operation with a cardroom? Can a 
dormant jai alai permit be conve
rted into a greyhound racing permit, with the result similar to the 
one just described
?
 
PMW, through rulings or inaction, has, in effect, answered all of these

The result has clearly been an expansion of gaming that has led to conte
ntious litigation. 
There are currently 21 lawsuits challenging PMW policies.
7
 
States place all sorts of limits on their gaming industry, from geographic locations (as with 
New Jersey
, which restricts casinos to Atlantic City
)
,
 
to limits on the number of li
censes 
(Pennsylvania, Illinois, Massachusetts and others)
,
 
to limiting gaming to pari
-
mutuel facilities (as 
with many states, such as Delaware and New York)
,
 
to limits on the number of gaming positions 
per p
roperty (Illinois, for example), to requirements that casinos be on riverboats (several Midwest 
states). 
 
The following macro factors are driving the expansion of gaming:
 

 
As states need more revenue, particularly in periods of economic recession, gaming bi
lls 
and referenda are more likely to be introduced, and to be viewed favorably
. 
This trend 
hails back to 1931, when Nevada introduced gambling in the midst of the Great 
Depression. In 1976, New Jersey voters approved casinos in large measure to assist 
econ
omically depressed Atlantic City. Economic downturns in the 1990s prompted a 
number of Midwestern states, from Illinois down to Mississippi
,
 
to create riverboat 
casino industries.
 

 
As related industries such as pari
-
mutuels see their own revenues and profitability 
decline, this prompts calls for subsidies, usually in the form of adding slot machines 
(often followed by table games) to pari
-
mutuel operations. Consequently, as 
race
track
s 
use some of this additional funding to increase purses, that trend is further fueled as 
tracks that compete for horses and export signals are pressured to increase their purses 
in response.
 

 
States respond to what occurs in other states. One political arg
ument that often gains 

are spending their dollars in neighboring states rather than at home. This argument has 
been used in a variety of states
 
in the last decade
 
in
cluding
 
Kentucky, Massachusetts, 
Ohio 
and
 
Pennsylvania. 
 

 
In the battles between pro
-
gaming and anti
-
gaming political campaigns, the playing 
field
 

succeed, but in many instances 
they have to continue doing battle in subsequent years. 
They have to win every time. Those who favor the expansion of gaming need to win 
only once.

10
 
 
That latter point can be illustrated in various states. For example, Ohio voters turned down 
four referenda 
between 1990 and 2008 that would have legalized casinos in various locations
.
8
 
In 
only one of those votes 

 
a 2006 measure to approve two casinos in Cuyahoga County, plus slot 
machines at seven racetracks 

 
did the measure gain support from more than 40 pe
rcent of the 
voters
. 
Yet, a fifth ballot measure in 2009 to authorize one casino in each of four Ohio cities 

 
Cleveland, Cincinnati, Columbus and Toledo 

 
was supported by 53 percent of Ohio voters.
9
 
Consequently, despite four successful efforts to defeat
 
casinos, Ohio is now a gaming state.
 
The most notable example of this phenomenon can be found in Florida itself, starting with 
a failed measure in 1978. The following account summarizes that effort: 
 
On November 4, 1978, Florida voters overwhelmingly reje
cted a proposal to legalize 
casinos along the Gold Coast 

 
and in Miami Beach in particular. By a lopsided 73 to 27 
margin, opponents of the casino legalization measure, led by two
-
term governor Reubin 
Askew, carried every county in Florida and beat back a
 
referendum similar in style and 
substance to the successful 1976 New Jersey initiative.
 
There were many obvious differences between the two states, which might account for the 
disparity in the vote. Of these, two are particularly notable: Florida has a la
rge Baptist 


the casino opposition had concluded that, while the November gambl
ing contest would be 
close, the momentum of the election appeared to be with the gambling proponents. In the 
few months between those polls and the November election, a spirited campaign against 
casinos led by influential south Florida commercial interests
 
appeared and turned a once 
close contest into a one
-
sided race.
10
 
That unsuccessful campaign 

 
which relied on the same campaign manager who conducted 
the successful 1976 campaign in New Jersey
11
 

 
did not end such efforts in Florida.
 
Spectrum professionals
, in previous careers, have been close observers of various gaming 
efforts in Florida. Indeed, working as a journalist for 
The Press of Atlantic City
 
in 1986, Spectrum 
Managing Director Michael Pollock witnessed the first in
-
person meeting between the poli
tical 
directors of two referenda on the ballot that year: an effort to legalize land
-
based casinos in hotels

impromptu meeting at Tampa International Airpor

While another proposed 
constit

by a 
vote of 
62
 
percent to 
38 percent, gaming proponents 
eventually seized a narrow 
victory in 2004 when a constitutional amendment was approved with 
less than 51 percent of the vote to allow racinos to open in Miami
-
Dade and Broward counties.
16
 
As noted in the previous section, these trends do not evolve in isolation, and the factors 
that
 
are driving expansion can feed off each other. For example, as states respond to actions taken 
in neighboring states, gaming is more likely to expand. This has the impact of making states more 
dependent on gaming revenue for growing portions of their budg
ets. At the same time, political 
forces that are pushing for expansion are learning from previous efforts in their own and in other 
states as to how campaigns could be shaped more effectively with messages that resonate.
 
Consequently, as more states author
ize and expand gaming, bringing it closer to more 
population centers,
 
participation and familiarity with gaming will inevitably increase. 
As an 
industry, gaming is uniquely dependent on 

 
and uniquely intertwined with 

 
the political process, 
and this rela


solution to having too much of it is to have more of it.

17
 
Indeed, that obs
ervation can be supported through various examples throughout the 
country. From New England to the Mid
-
Atlantic region and to the Midwest and beyond, states 
respond to the expansion of gaming in other states by expanding gaming within their states. As 
expl
ained in more detail later in the report, the catalysts for such expansion include:
 

 

home.
 

 
The pari
-
mutuel industry is hurting, and needs expanded gaming in order to surv
ive and 
to compete against larger purses available at competing tracks in other states.
 

 
Gaming is viewed as a fiscal solution when states feel the pinch of an economic 
recession.
 

ve a distinct 

but do not have to fund services such as problem
-
gambling treatment, which is usually funded by 
the state where the problem gambler lives. Fo
r example, Spectrum learned from studies we 
conducted in Massachusetts and Connecticut that problem gamblers who lived in Massachusetts 
might have been gambling at Connecticut casinos, but Connecticut and its tribal operators did not

As noted

limits 
that 
are enshrined in the state Constitution
 
do not necessarily 
preclude serious expansion effo
rts
. 
Florida offers another telling example of that, in the 2004 
constitutional amendment that led to the approval of racinos in Miami
-
Dade and Broward counties
. 
That amendment
 
initially limited that privilege to operating pari
-
mutuels, which would have 
e
xcluded Hialeah. That was changed through 2010 legislation, which survived subsequent legal 
challenges, but created some new consequences. 
Veteran gaming reporter Nick Sortal identified 
those consequences in a report for the 
Sun
-
Sentinel

States Endeavor to Realize Value from Gaming
 
via License Fees
 
One important theme that resonates throughout this report is that no other private industry 

 
and certainly none in the entertainment or 
hospitality field
s 

 
is as dependent as remaining in the 
good graces of public officials
 
for its ability to earn a profit, or even for its very existence
. 
The flip 
side of that is that no other private industry has the ability to secure 
such 
local or regio
nal 
monopolies. Sometimes, these local monopolies are granted to private interests simply because 
those interests own a particular piece of land, such as a racetrack.
 
 
In Florida, the holder of a slot machine license must pay an annual license fee of $2 mi
llion, 
which is due when the application is filed or with the renewal date. There is no fee to obtain an 
annual pari
-
mutuel operating license. But in conjunction with its monthly tax payment, each 
permitholder pays a daily license fee. For jai alai, it is 
$40 per game. For greyhound permitholders, 
it is $80 per race that may be offset w
ith eligible tax credits under s

In recent years, a number of states have endeavored to realize value from the issuance of 
such license
s
 
by requiring license fees or some equivalent in exchange for the rights and privileges 
of oper
ating a gaming facility. 
 
The core rationale in requiring such
 
one

time
 
fees is that licenses have value, and states 
should not give away something that could command significant dollars in the open market. 
Veteran investment banker Jeff Hooke, managing di
rector of Focus Investment Bank, has been a 
longstanding advocate for the principle of states realizing the full value of such licenses. More 
than a decade ago, he noted the following regarding states that had authorized gaming in preceding 

Illinoi
s, Indiana and Michigan awarded the gaming licenses for free to politically 
connected groups, under the guise of aiding economically depressed areas or failing racetracks. 
Even after the impact of betting taxes were included, the awardees turned around and
 
made vast 
profits.

While Hooke is correct in that states can realize value in something that many states had 
given away, the more immediate incentive is that states can realize significant revenue quickly. 
That prospect 
has driven
 
more states in recent years to seek license 
fees.
 
However, license fees do have a cost. From the standpoint of a potential developer, a 
license fee is part of the necessary investment in a potential project. It is the equivalent of the 
capital investment that would be made in various areas, ranging 
from site acquisition and 
improvement to architecture fees and construction costs
. 
But, unlike the costs that are incurred to 
build a physical facility, the license fee does not add to the value of that facility. When calculating 
a return on investment (

ROI

), a license fee is part of the 
investment, which is the 
denominat
or 
in that ratio
. But 
a license fee
 
does nothing to increase the numerator, the profit. Consequently, the 
license fee is effectively a sunk cost that does not generate revenue, which wou
ld in turn fuel 
various public benefits from gaming taxes to employment.
 
An operator that does not have to carry that cost can invest more in the property to increase 
revenue and ROI. That is particularly important in a competitive bidding process. In 2008
, 
Spectrum prepared a report for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in advance of gaming 
legislation that included a provision for a $200 million initial licensing fee. That report noted the 
following:
 
Initial license fees required of successful developmen
t bidders are generally viewed as part 
of their capital investments and therefore:
 

 
Have a detractive effect on capital development spend, as the licensing expense 
competes internally for capital with construction spending.
 

 
Pose a dampening effect on develo
pment interest among potential candidates, as the 
fees raise the cost of entry with no direct return on that expense, and thereby 
simultaneously reduce projected ROIC rates.
 
This is not to say government entities should not impose substantial operator lice
nse fees, 
to both winnow out under
-

-
up and 
other infrastructure costs, but rather to make clear the underlying considerations.
 
At a $200 million minimum bid, the Massachusetts casino licensing fee, com
bined with 
the minimum development requirements, will ensure that only financially strong 
companies will apply. On the other hand, this is potentially $200 million less in capital 
invested into each of the destination casinos. This fee could be viewed by b
oth the state 
and license applicants as the price of operating in a closed, geographically protected 
environment.

Projecting and Preparing for Potential Impact of 
Expanded Gaming on Commonwealth of Massachusetts

17
 
 
Three years later, the Expanded Gaming Act became law in Massachusetts, and included a 
minimum $85 million licensing fee, significantly lower
 
than what had been contemplated in the 
2008 proposed legislation
.
33
 
Between 2008 and 2011, a severe national recession struck, which certainly played a role 
in convincing lawmakers in Massachusetts to reduce the required minimum capital investment. At 
the 
same time, however, we suggest that lawmakers also recognized that a large license fee could 
also detract from capital investment and its subsequent economic benefits.
 
Based on the language within its statute
34
 
that governs the competitive bidding process, 
Massachusetts is a pioneer in the planning of gaming. The law requires bidders to put forth 
comprehensive proposals that address many areas that are often not addressed, or paid little heed, 
in other gaming statutes. Such areas range from impact on employm
ent to impact on local arts, as 
well as on small businesses.

Racetrack Casinos Evolve
, Table Games Arrive
 
In 1990, the concept of a racino was introduced to the 
U
nited 
S
tates
 
with the 
opening
 
of 

35
 
at Mountaineer Park Rac
etrack in West Virginia. With the 
success of the West Virginia experiment, racinos soon spread to Rhode Island, Iowa and Delaware. 
M
any states that introduce commercial casino gambling do so through the initial introduction of 
slots
-
only facilities. Exampl
es of this include, among others, Pennsylvania, Delaware, West 
Virginia, Rhode Island, New York and Florida racinos 

 
although poker 
at the Florida tracks is 
a 
notable exception. The logic behind such moves tends to include the following:
 

 
Slots are viewed 
as more politically acceptable.
 

 
Slots 

 
because they lack live dealers, as well as necessary controls over dice and other 
gambling paraphernalia 

 
are viewed as easier to regulate.
 
The latter point is particularly noteworthy for states in which the lottery
 
is vested with the 
authority to oversee slots or VLTs
,
 
such as Delaware, Maryland, New York
, 
Rhode Island
 
and 
West Virginia
. However, even in lottery states, the natural evolution over the past decade has been 
to add live tables to slots
-
only facilities. 
We attribute that trend to two larger forces at play, which 
are dealt with in more detail elsewhere in this report:
 

 
Fiscal pressures to generate additional revenue, as well as pressure to add jobs.

From th
e standpoint of a player, slots and VLTs are indistinguishable. The core difference is that slots 
can be standalone devices, while VLTs can be tied to a central system that monitors and/or controls all critical 
aspects of the games.

Commercial Gaming at t

Delaware. The only way they can keep those Maryland residents from staying in Maryland is 
offering incentives or differentiated products that somehow make it worthwhile to travel. But

If regulated properly, the addition of table games can be a smooth transition that can also 
encourage capital investment and 
expansion. The
 
addition of house
-
banked table games such as
 
blackjack to a slots
-
only casino can serve to increase slot revenue. This seems counter
-
intuitive 
(the natural assumption is that new table games would simply cannibalize existing slot play) but 
experience in markets that have added tables to casinos that
 
previously offered only slot machines 
shows otherwise. This phenomenon can be attributed to two major factors:
 

 
Some new table
-
game customers (who previously had no incentive to visit a slots
-
only 
casino) can be expected to apportion some of their own spen
ding to slots.
 

 
Some of these new customers would be accompanied by other guests 

 
such as a spouse 
or a friend 

 
who would play slots during these visits.

find
s
 
no compelling evidence that adding table games to a slots

casino would
 
reduce slot revenue. 
In fact, research shows that 
slots and table games in a casino 
are complementary assets.

for 2008 through 2012 (two entire calendar years before and after table games). In the two years

To determine whether the implementation of table games had a material impact on slot 
revenue we examined the slot revenue variance in 2010 (when all Delaware casinos offered table 
games in second half of year). If the introduction of table gam

on slot revenue we would expect to see the slot revenue variance to be inconsistent with 2008 and

As illustrated, on a statewide basis (and consistent amongst casinos), the decline in slot 
revenue (second half of year compared to first half of year) was greater in the two years without 
Delaware having table games than it was in both the first and second years following the 
commencement of Delaware offering table games. Specifically, slot rev
enue only declined by 9 
percent in 2010 from the first half of year to second half of year (when table games were fully 
operational)
;
 
this percentage decline was greater in 2008 and 2009, absent presence of table games

(at 9.4 percent and 9.9 percent, resp
ectively). We note that in 2011, the decline in slot revenue 
from the first half of the year to the second half of the year was even less pronounced than in prior 
years (at only 6.9 percent), which may suggest that table games were complimentary to slots a
nd/or 

.
 
We acknowledge that myriad other factors may impact these aforementioned growth rates, 
as illustrated in 2012, when growth rates plummeted from first half of year to second half of year 
(i.e., possibly due to opening of Maryland Live Casino located near Baltimore, MD
,
 
in June 2012 
along with widespread impact of Superstorm Sandy hitting the region in October 2012).

West Virginia
 
There are four racinos in West Virginia, with all four offer
ing table games. Initially, all 
four racinos were limited to slots: The racinos offer VLTs that are operated by the West Virginia 
Lottery, while there is also a network of limited VLT operations at numerou
s, licensed locations 
statewide
. 
 
In mid
-
2007, vote
rs (via referendum at the 
host 
county level) supported allowing table 
games at three of the four racinos (the referendum failed in Jefferson 
County
, home to Charles 
Town 

 

racino)
. Consequently, two casinos (Mountaineer Park and Wheelin
g 
Island) began table game operation in late 2007 while Tri
-
State Park began table game operations 
in August 2008. 
A 
December 2009 referendum to add tables at Charles Town did pass and table 
game operations commenced in July 2010. 
(
A fifth casino, the Gree
nbrier
 
resort
, began operations 
i
n West Virginia in October 2009.
 
The Greenbrier, a resort hotel
 
with no racetrack
, offers both 
slots and table games.
)
 
We examined slot revenue performance at Charles Town, since this racino generates more 
than half of the 
GGR in West Virginia, and is relatively isolated from any other racino in West 
Virginia or 
neighboring
 
states. Specifically, we examined slot revenue variance data 

 
comparing 
second half of year to first half of year 

 
for 2008 through 2012 (two years before and after table 
games 

 
as table games became operational in July 2010 at Charles Town). In the two years 
before
 
Charles Town having table games, slot revenue was lower in the second half of the year than it 
was in 
the first half of year
.
 
To determine whether the implementation of table games had a material impact on slot 
revenue, we examined the slot revenue variance in 2010 (when Charles Town added table games 
in the second half of year). If the introduction of tab
le games had a significant, negative impact on 
slot revenue, we would expect to see the slot revenue variance to be inconsistent with 2008 and 
2009 variance data (prior to table games). The following table illustrates this slot revenue variance 
data at Cha
rles Town from 2008 through 2012

As illustrated, the decline in slot revenue (second half of year compared to first half of 
year) was greater in the two years without Charles Town having table games than in the initial year 
of Charles Town offering table gam
es. Specifically, slot revenue only declined by 1.5 percent in 
2010 from first half of year to second half of year (when table games were fully operational) while 
this percentage decline was greater in 2008 and 2009, absent presence of table games (at 8.3 
percent and 13.2 percent, respectively). We note that in 2011, there was an increase in slot revenue 
from first half of year to second half of year, which may suggest that table games were 
complimentary to slots and/or that table games enhanced overall app
eal of Charles Town (i.e., 
translating into greater slot revenue levels than what would otherwise be, absent table games). 
 
As with Delaware (and so noted above), there are numerous factors that may impact growth 
rates.
 
d.
 
Pennsylvania
 
There are 11 casinos in
 
Pennsylvania, all of which prior to mid
-
2010 were limited to slots. 
Table games operations commenced in July 2010
.
 

table games (LTM June 2011) compared to the fu
ll year prior (LTM June 2010) we see 
inconclusive results on the collective impact of table games on slot revenue. Collectively, slot 
revenue grew by 10.7 percent when comparing the two periods; however, nearly all of this slot 
revenue growth occurred at t
wo of the newer casinos (Sands Bethlehem and Rivers, opening in 
May 2009 and August 2009, respectively) and as a result of a new casino in Philadelphia (which 
opened in September 2010). 
 
The seven Pennsylvania casinos that opened in 2007 and 2008 had a col
lective 0.1 percent 
increase in slot reven
u
e when comparing LTM June 2011 to LTM June 2010 (i.e., post
-
 
vs. pre
-
table games). Four of the seven reported increased slot revenue, while three of the seven reported 
declines in slot revenue.
 
This was, of course

additional casinos opening in
-
state and in surrounding area. That makes it difficult to isolate any 
precise cause and effect on either table or slot revenue. Still, we note that any e
xpected 
cannibalization of slot revenue by the addition of table games did not materialize in Pennsylvania.

Battle for Entertainment Dollars: Competition on a Broader Scale

Rather, he characterized other 

providers in which they broadly compete for 
a share of all discretionary income.
 
That might be a welcome and necessary step in an industry that is increasingly facing 
saturation in its core business. But that evolution has implications for other businesses, industries 
and regions that already battle
 
for that entertainment dollar, and that do not offer gaming 

 
nor do 
they intend to offer gaming as an option.

class resort by any standard that has managed to 
achieve success in multiple categories, 
most notably for purposes of this discussion: families with children; and business travel, 
particularly in the MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) segment.
 
Due to its abundance of theme parks, ho
tels and other assets and infrastructure, Orlando 
competes nationally and globally in various segments, and Las Vegas 

 
a destination centered on 
gaming 

 
is clearly a competitor. Interestingly, Las Vegas endeavored to leverage its brand into 
the family se
gment, but has more recently sharpened its focus on more adult segments, as noted 
here:
 

started to legalize gambling. In an attempt to stimulate visitor numbers the city 
was 
reinvented in the image of Disney. Themed hotels such as the Luxor and Excalibur emerged 
allowing Las Vegas to market itself as a place for adults to gamble while their children 
played at theme parks such as the one built by the MGM Grand. Circus Circu

themed hotel that was built in 1976 was the only hotel that attended to the needs of children. 
With the development of these new hotels Circus Circus would now face competition for 
the younger demographic of customers and their f
amilies. Las Vega
s in the 21st C
entury 
saw its second major change in visitor demographics. No longer the place for the family, 
Las Vegas has morphed into one of the top party cities in the world, ranking top ten in 
numerous different polls. Attracting 21 

 
34 years olds f
rom all over the world, Las Vegas 
now ranks number one in categories such as, top destination for bachelor and bachelorette 
celebrations (www.AskMen.com 2009), top destination to celebrate a 21st birthday 
(www.ehow.com).

characteristic: Both destinations developed from scratch, in a relatively brief period, a massive 
infrastructure of hotel 
rooms, meeting and convention space, and entertainment attractions.
 
Each 
destination has a critical mass of attractions
, which helps fuel visitation. 
John McReynolds, Senior 
Vice President of External Affairs for Universal Parks & Resorts, 
noted, for examp
le, that 
Universal does well when other attractions in Orlando prove to be popular, and the success of the 
Wizarding World of Harry Potter serves as a magnet that, in turn, increases overall attendance,

set are also hosting casinos. The number of major convention cities with casinos already includes 
Las Vegas, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Detroit and New York, a
nd will soon include Boston, and 
the possibility of additional gambling venues in Chicago. Atlanta, another major convention 
destination in the Southeast, has been contemplating gaming for several years.
 
In 2007, PKF Consulting released a report on the pot
ential economic impact of a casino in 
Atlanta, and its executive managing director Mark Woodworth made this statement: "We're seeing 
more and more destinations that have gambling, which functions as an important amenity, 
especially in attracting group meet
ings and conventions.

"
 

this 
countervailing 
national
 
trend underscores an important 
asset
 

in attracting business travelers is gro
wing without gaming, and that absence is to some degree 
fueling that growth. Orlando has carve
d out a significant, profitable 
niche in that national market, 
and gaming would clearly be antithetical to that image and its ability to dominate that important 
s
egment.
 
Interviews with various hotel operators in the Orlando area, which are members of the 
Central Florida Hotel & Lodging Association, have lent support to that view. The members 
interviewed for this report note, for example, that many of the meeting p
lanners who book Orlando 
for their groups cite the absence of gambling as a plus, since that attraction might otherwise be

The table above shows that, in both domestic leisure and convention/group business, 
designated market areas
 
(DMAs)
 

 
which are independent media markets 

 
in other regions of 
Florida are critically importan
t to Orlando. Daryl Cronk, Director of Research at Visit Orlando, 
described this phenomenon:

The proximity of Daytona to the east, and Tampa to the west,

It may be to attend a convention, to visit a theme park, a 
special event such as Halloween Horror Nights at Universal or Food & Wine at Epcot, or 
something as simple as a Magic game (just like I have frie

Taken together, these factors 

 
the evolution of gaming into 
broader entertainment, the 

national markets 

 
support many of the concerns expressed by the Orlando business community 
as to the expansion of gaming throughout Fl
orida, particularly the possibility of new destination 
resorts.
 
Clearly, the addition of such destinations 

 
which would add new supply to the competitive 
conventions and meetings business, while adding additional amenities to competing facilities in 
South
 
Florida 

 
raises the possibility of an adverse impact on business in the Orlando area.
 
John Sowinski of No Casinos said the impact would not necessarily be limited to the larger 
players in Florida markets, but could have serious ramifications for the smal
ler attractions, many 
of which depend on in
-
state and out
-
of
-
state visitors who are looking for secondary and tertiary 
activities during their leisure time. Sowinski suggests that such attractions 

 
which might include 
Gatorland in the Orlando region or Ju
ngle Island in the Miami area 

 
might be more likely to lose 
out if more discretionary dollars are targeted toward gambling.

More generally, and with respect to Florida, expanded gambling may fundamentally 
change the state of Florida as a place to live and visit. Bill Lupfer, of the Florida Attractions 
Association, 
suggests
 
that the expansion of gambling, particularly casino gambling, will be 

order to attract tourists. This was certainly true in the 1990s when casinos first began t
o expand 
outside Nevada and New Jersey. Florida, however, already offers more attractions than any other 

, he notes
.
50
 
Rather than benefitting the state, 
expanded gambling (especially casinos) could make Flor
ida a less
-
attractive tourist destination.
 
The tourism industry leadership in Orlando, as interviewed for this analysis, appears 
unified in its view that any expansion 
of 
gaming in Florida would have several tremendous 
economic and social impacts to the St
ate. 
 
If gambling were to be expanded in Florida, tourism leaders cite a variety of potential 
implications, including the following: 
 

 
Economic costs
 
o
 

 
o
 
Change in target market of the destination and thus potential ec
onomic losses.
 
o
 
Potential cost of moving to the unionization of hotels.
 
o
 
Economic impact to small businesses.
 
o
 
Lost business because some meeting planners will not book business in gaming 
destinations.
 

 
Social costs
 
o
 
Change in the brand position and potential l
oss of global goodwill.
 
o
 
Change in staffing at properties 
that 
might impact the f
riendliness of the 

a friendly 
destination.
 
o
 
Change in the perceptions of safety, as the leisure market will not c
hoose 
destinations where safety may be compromised.

Conclusion
 
Intentionally or not, the policies established by lawmakers 

 
or the lack thereof 

 
play a 
critical role in the evolution and expansion of gaming. Indeed, in the views of many, the 


. 
The industry rarely shrinks, and 
quite often, expands as a result of expansion. As demonstrated in this section, the notion expressed 
by John Sowinski of No Casinos that the answer to saturation is often mo
re gaming can be borne 
out by examples. Even industry segments that have seen their customer base decline 

 
such as jai 
alai or dog racing, as well as other segments of the 
pari
-
mutuel
 
industry 

 
are still in business. 
Rules that may seem fixed and immutab
le 

 
such as constitutional amendments 

 
often prove to 
be less than immutable. Policymakers need to be aware that every change in policy creates 
consequences that, in turn, create a demand for more policy changes. As demonstrated in the past, 
such changes
 
often lead to an expansion of gaming, which creates a demand for more changes.
 
Such changes could have significant impacts that extend beyond gaming, as evidenced by 
the concerns expressed by the business community in Orlando.

The 
Prevalence
 
of Gambling
 
a.
 
Nationally
 
To our knowledge
,
 
the most compr
ehensi
ve gambling studies, both
 
nationally and for 
Florida on a statewide basis, were conducted more than a decade ago. The first authoritative 
national gambling research was conducted by the 
Commission on the Review of the National 
Policy Toward Gambling 
in 197
6. The most extensive and authoritative nationwide study was 
published in 1999 by the 
National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago
 
in 
a 768
-
page report
. This groundbreaking research 
compil
ed
 
survey
 
re
s
ults 
f
rom
 
approximatel
y 3,000 
gamblers
 
and non
-
gamblers
 
and was conducted as part of the National 
Gambling Impact Study 
Commission
 
for the federal government.
 
The study documented gambling prevalence among US 
residents at a lifetime rate of 68 percent and a past
-
12
-
month
s
 
rate of 61 percent fo
r all forms of 
gambling.
54
 
 
Gambling has expanded greatly since 1999, when some form of legalized gambling was 
being offered or had been approved in a total 
of 25 states
,
55
 
to the present where 
42
 
states
 
currently 
offer some form of legal gambling other than
 
the lottery
.
 
The most recent information on national 

State of the 
States
 
survey. While this is not a rigorous academic study it does represent the most up to date 
data released,
 
released in the first week of May, 2013. This latest update to the annual study 
documents gambling prevalence as follows among the general US population:
 

 
Past 
-
12
-
months participation in the following gambling activities:
 
o
 
Lottery
 
 
 
 
53 percent
 
o
 
Casino gamb
ling
 
 
 
32 percent
 
o
 
Casual betting with friends
 
26 percent
 
o
 
Playing poker
 
 
 
12 percent
 
o
 
Wagering on a race
 
 
  
6 percent
 
o
 
Internet gambling
 
 
 
  
3 percent
 
From the above information we can extrapolate that almost one
-
third of the adult 
population over 21 in the 
U
nited States
 
has gambled in a casino within the past year. Among young 
adults, aged 21 to 35, the proportions playing the lottery, betting casually with friends, playing 
poker, and gambling over the Internet are significantly greater.

Of course
,
 
gambling incidence varies considerably with access to local or regional gaming 
facilities. Various studies commissioned by individual states since 1976 have shown lifetime 
prevalence rates ranging from 64 p

ce rates 
ranging even more broadly from between 49 percent to 89 percent.

A meta

Florida but rather viewed as a refinement of the measurement criteria in the 2011 study and mo
re 
consistent with the national rate of gambling participation. 
 
Despite the difficulty in making overall gambling prevalence comparisons, the 2011 update 
agrees closely with the 2001 study in identifying lottery, raffles or charitable games, casinos, hors
e 
or dog racing, and bingo as the top five gambling activities among Florida residents. More than 
half of all survey respondents have played the lottery at least once in their lifetime, almost half 
have participated in a raffle, and 40 percent have gambled
 
in a land
-
based casino.

Both gambling prevalence studies also break out past year gambling participation. Past

year gam
bling participation among Floridians is generally consistent with lifetime participation 
and similarly highest for the lottery, raffles or charitable games, and casinos (both floating and 
land
-
based), followed by cards/dice/dominos, horse or dog racing, an
d sporting events through a 
pool or between friends. What is most revealing about this behavioral comparison after a decade 
is that Florida resident

variety of topics including da

Competitive I
ssues
 

-
based casino industry competes within itself on two levels: for customers 
and gaming revenue, and for 
attention
 
from the Florida Legislature.
 
Seminole 
Gaming 

 
particularly
 
its flagship
 
Seminole Hard Rock in Hollywood 

 
is a well
-
functioning, well
-
capitalized and well
-
managed operation that has succeeded in leveraging 
numerous assets, from its brand to its design to its tax structure and beyond, to the point where it 
essenti
ally competes to varying degrees with all of the operating racinos in Miami
-
Dade and 
Broward counties.
 
The racinos themselves compete with each other and with the Seminole operations on the 
bases of their location, access, design, customer service, loyalty
 
programs as well as their brands 
and racing operations. Various other rules they must operate under, from their hours of operation 
to their mandated no
-
smoking policies, also play a role. The most visible and impactful rules that 
limit their competitive a
bilities are the tax structure they operate under, as well as their inability to 
match the same array of offerings as their tribal competitors. The racinos, for example, are barred 
from offering house
-
banked card games, which are popular at the Seminole 
ca
sinos
.
 
While the racino operations share those concerns, they do not necessarily share the same 
priorities. Some put the need for table games as a top priority, while others would place tax parity 
higher on the list, or at least a reduced tax rate that wou
ld help justify additional capital investment. 
 
This absence of a uniform agenda has made it difficult for the racinos to advance 
their 
cause(s)
, a situation that is exacerbated by a lack of understanding among the racinos themselves 
as to their individual
 
challenges
. 
While jai alai has little in common with dog racing
,
 
and neither 
has much in common with horse racing, there is little visible camaraderie between
 
operators of 
thoroughbred and standardbred
 
facilities
, even the thoroughbred tracks themselves 
can find 
themselves at odds.
 
For example, Gulfstream announced its racing schedule this year and is breaking a 
longstanding tradition of cooperation with other thoroughbred tracks by extending its meet year
-
round, thus competing directly with Calder. This 
is one of several related issues regarding 
skirmishes between the tracks, which are about 10 miles 
apart.
 
Still, the issue of conflicting agendas 

 
what was referred to earlier 
by some observers 
as a 


 
has created a legislative stal
emate, but has also led to other curious results, 
as exemplified by the situation in jai alai. That sport 

 
which originated in Spain and first appeared 
in the United States in Miami nearly a century ago 

 
enjoyed its heyday of popularity between the 
mid
-
1
950s and 1970s, when nine jai alai frontons opened in Florida alone
.
67
 
Starting in the early 
1990s, the sport endured a dramatic retreat in popularity, with many frontons closing
.
68
 
Still, the

sport survives, in large measure because it is tied to 

 
and subs
idized by 

 
casino gaming and, to 
a lesser extent, by revenue from cardroom poker, which is roughly 4 p
ercent of gross poker 
receipts.
 
Jai alai cannot make the same claims as the horse
-
racing industry that it supports numerous 
ancillary industries 

 
such a

and nations 

 
yet its subsidies endure, with no visible efforts to eliminate, reduce or replace them. 
 
With a jai alai fronton comes the ability to open a cardroom, a simulcasting p
arlor and/or 
a casino in Broward and Miami
-
Dade counties in South Florida. Those possibilities have been 
enough to entice investors to seek new jai alai permits even though investors realize that the jai 
alai portion of their investment will lose money. Th
ey hope to cover their losses with revenue from 
other forms of gambling.
 
When Hamilton Jai Alai and Poker opened in December 2005, it was the 
first new fronton built in Florida in 22 years.
69
 
Its owner, Glenn Richards, told Spectrum in an 
interview that wit
hout the cardroom and simulcast parlor, he never would have built the fronton 
and it would have been closed long ago without the cardroom revenue.
 
Miami Jai Alai opened its slot facility on January 23, 2012. Its operator was hopeful that 
slot machine reven
ue would improve 
its 
fiscal situation
. 
But the company has struggled to pay its 
debt service, resulting in a foreclosure action by its lenders. During its first six months of casino 
operation in 2012, it lost nearly $7 million.
70
 
In addition to the prospect
s of cardroom and casino revenue, a jai alai license can be 
transferred or leased to another operator. The courts are currently reviewing whether a jai alai 
permit can be converted into a greyhound or racing permit. The bottom line is that jai alai permits
 
are being issued and sought due to reasons that have nothing to do with the profitability of jai alai.
 
Indeed, the jai alai sector as a whole sustained an operating loss of $14 million in FY 2012.
71
 
 
So why do the subsidies for jai alai endure? The elimina
tion or reduction of jai alai 
subsidies would give casinos tied to frontons an unfair advantage over casinos tied to other forms 
of pari
-
mutuel wagering. The same arguments could be made for dog racing as well. If dog
-
racing 


-
mutuel operations from their gaming operations, 
this would effectively lower their overall obligations, the effective tax rate they now pay. By 
having a lower effective tax rate, this would eliminate parity 
with
 
the pari
-
mutuels that ar
e not 
decoupled, and any potential for eliminating parity can be expected to generate opposition. So, the 
subsidies endure because their presence helps ensure that all pari
-
mutuels pay a similar effective 
tax rate.

So, while racinos do not agree amongst themselves, nor do they agree with

Florida: opposition to gaming expansion by allowing new entrants to de

the compact agreement, STOF would be able to stop making the compact fee payments
 
from its 
Broward County casinos (Hollywood Hard Rock, Seminole Hollywood Classic and Seminole 
Coconut Creek) which account for about half of the gaming division's revenues. Other facilities in 
Immokalee, Tampa and Brighton would not be directly impacted.

Identifying
, Capturing Markets
 
Depending on their location, access, neighborhoods, amount and quality of capital 
investment and distance from competitors, each existing Florida operation has developed its own 
marketing strategy and customer base.
 
For example, Isle Casino Racing Pompano Park competes against the Seminole Hard Rock 
for its higher

against 
Seminole Coconut Creek casino for the day

Yet, with 1,450 slots and 48 poker tables, 
Isle 
still managed to generate $
155 million in gross 
gaming revenue during the past 12 months
.
74
 
Isle generally generates about 40 percent of its annual revenue during the January
-
April 
period, thanks to the lift created by the incoming snowbird population that fills the condominiums 
and 
other housing units near the beach. In that sense, Isle is typical of many of the racino operations 
in South Florida.
 
Isle is also typical in its marketing strategy, eschewing relatively expensive mass
-
media 
options in favor of more targeted approaches, su
ch as direct
-
mail and billboards. According to 
General Manager Rob Wyre, customers respond
 
to the nature of the offer, which casino
 
is 
providing the best deal, but also to the perception as to the looseness of the slots.
 
Isle reports that 
between 60 and 65
 

up for the loyalty program and who identify themselves as players during their visit to earn 
rewards.
 
That percentage is about 10 points higher than what is reported at Miami
 
Jai Alai, an older 
property in a more urban area
.
75
 
Miami Jai Alai management views its location as an asset that can 
be exploited, with heavy population centers nearby, and easy access to South Beach in Miami 
Beach. The property enjoys a strong police pre
sence and patrons feel safe
, according to 
management, which also 
notes that while the median player in its database is likely to be a female 
between 50 and 55 years of age
, age drops noticeably after 2 a.m.
 
Its demographics are also skewed 
heavily to the C
uban/Latino population, 
and to a lesser degree the H
aitian population. With that in 
mind, management views the televising of jai alai on Telemundo and Univision as part of its 
marketing strategy.
 
Calder Casino and Race Course is also typical of the racino 
market in drawing most of its 
customers from within a 10
-
mile radius, and also competes against both the Hard Rock and 
Coconut Creek casinos, with the former being only two exit stops away on the Florida Turnpike
. 
Calder competes against Coconut Creek for 
the market in the Boca Raton area
.
76
 
 
Calder management believes that its close proximity to Sun Life Stadium, its Turnpike 
access, its equidistance of 20 miles from both Miami and Fort Lauderdale airports and its 220
-
acre 
site are assets that could benefit
 
from additional capital investment in more amenities, but that 
possibility is presently precluded by the tax structure, which would prevent such investments from 
generating a sufficiently attractive return on investment.
 
Calder competes with Gulfstream on
 
multiple fronts, from geography to its thoroughbred 
racing meets, but the racinos clearly operate under different models. Gulfstream is being positioned

as a racing destination and as a centerpiece for the Stronach Group, which is moving its racing 
operat
ions to Florida, and which operates other tracks
, including the signature 
Santa Anita in 
California. The core difference is that Gulfstream focuses more on racing, and views casino 
gaming primarily as a means of funding purses, which allows 
it 
to compete f
or top horses with 
tracks in northern states
.
77
 
Gulfstream is planning significant additional capital investment
 
(see Chapter II[B][6][c] 
for more detail)
, undeterred by the tax rate. It has already managed to attract a younger 
demographic, in part because 
of its Village at Gulfstream investment, which opened in 2009.

A number of the racino operators report that competition is fierce,
 
a competition heightened 
by the restrictions under which they operate.
 
Not all restrictions are gaming

related. Magic City 
Casino reports, for example, that any plans it 
might consider to add a hotel are limited by 
restrictions on high

rise development near the airport.
78
 
Managers there are also concerned about 
capital investment that might be impacted by future destination resort
 
casino
s, a risk factor that 
discourages cap
ital investment as well. Along that same line of reasoning, Mardi Gras management

Hialeah

a place that 
would entertain families, adults young and old and once again become a tourist destination.

Dade County. 
Soon will come a small museum exhibiting the history of racing and the history of South 
Florida; the
 
creation of an urban entertainment district for those who live, work, shop and 
play in the region; an outlet shopping village with restaurants; a new boutique hotel and a 
metro rail station and business complex for the City of
 
Hialeah and Miami Dade Count
y.
81
 
The property plans to take advantage of some inherent assets, ranging from its location in 
the midst of 
a 
large Cuban

American population to its proximity to a train station in front of its 
property. Hialeah management plans to aggressively market itse

Profitability
 
Casino gambling is generally a profitable business
. 
As service businesses without costs of 
raw materials and inventory or the need to invest in research and development, casino companies 
are efficient 
operations, generating high operating margins

depreciation and amortization) to revenues of 22.1

operations

Reasons for Gaming Profitability
 
In terms of EBITDA return on total invested capital, a 
measure of profitability in relation 
to fixed plant, casino companies are very profitable
. 
In 2012, the same four
 
large gaming 
companies generated an average of 16.2
 
percent
 
return on invested capital
. 
The regional gaming 
companies generated a 13.6

This compares to 18.8

Note:
 
Seneca Gaming stopped publicly reporting results in 2010.
 
Casinos
 
tend to be profitable in great part due to the many barriers to entry that limit 
competition
. 
First among these is the requirement for licensing
. 
Many persons and companies will 
not want to get licensed due to the invasiveness of the process and its ongoi
ng nature
. 
Similarly, 
the transparency of the operations due to public reporting requirements is a deterrent to those not 

.

 
Possibly more importantly, most jurisdictions limit the number 
of gaming licenses or restrict the
 
locales in which casinos can operate, thereby restricting the 
number of casinos that can open
. 
Additionally, the capital
-
intensive nature of gaming, whether for 
the need for large and specialized physical plants or the high working capital needed to run t
he 
operations, result in a high capital cost, limiting participants only to those who can amass the great 
amount of capital needed
. 
Lastly, gaming is a highly specialized cash
-
intensive operation requiring 
complex management controls regarding security, ma
rketing and cost controls, which limits the 
number of capable operators.

b.
 
Factors Affecting P
rofitability
 
Within the gaming industry, some properties are more profitable than others for a multitude 
of reasons:
 

 
Gaming tax rate
 

 
The assessment made by the hosting jurisdictions is among the most 
significant determinants in casino profitability
. 
Tax rates can range from 7
 
percent
 
to 65
 
percent
 
of house gaming win
83
, sometimes with additional up
-
front and ongoing 
payments to host c
ommunities, local public benefit organizations and the state or 
national government that is granting the gaming license
. 
Higher rates are generally 
imposed in jurisdictions that limit competition, vesting greater value in the license 
rights
. 
But obviously,
 
the higher the tax rate, the lesser the ability of the gaming operator 

s
 
operating results, jeopardizing 
profitability and the ability to withstand competition.
 
The absence of a gaming tax is a key 
element to the profitability of many 
Indian
 
casinos
. 
Without having to pay such a tax, the tribal gaming operation has substantially more 
flexibility to spend more on customer marketing including complimentary services such 
as rooms, food and beverage, giv
ing them a potential co
mpetitive advantage against tax
-
paying commercial casinos
. 
Additionally, non
-
tax
-
paying Indian
 
casinos can return 
more to their owners or use the funds to pay down debt sooner, assuring them greater 
financial stability
. 
The benefits 

exemption from corporate federal and state income taxes.
 

 
Cost of capital
 

 
Gaming is a capital
-
intensive business, and getting more so as casinos 
get larger and incorporate more non
-
gaming amenities
. 
A
 

attract lower cost capital can make a huge difference in its profitability as measured by 
return to shareholders and 
its 
ability to pay down debt
. 
Capital costs tend to be lower 
for larger projects, more diversified gaming compa
nies, and companies with a longer 
track record.
 

 
Competition
 

 
The level of competition in a market is a major determinant in any 

. 
This is best illustrated in operating margin performance, as a more 
competitive environment will force 
casinos to offer more incentives to customers to get 
them to play at any particular casino and reduce this margin
. 
Return on investment will 
similarly be affected by greater competition as the operating profit declines in relation 
to the original capital c
ost.
 

 
Scope and diversity of offerings
 

 
The efficacy of investment on the variety of 
amenities that can accompany a casino can have a dramatic impact on overall

-

. 
Conv
ersely, high volume turnover at any of these offerings can lead to highly efficient 
businesses that may generate profits beyond what similar operations not associated with 
a casino could generate, thereby enhancing the overall profitability of the project
.
 

 
Accessibility
 

 
Gaming is 
o
ften convenience
-
driven, so accessibility, ease of parking, 
and matters of ingress and egress can have a major impact on profitability
. 
Gaming 
customers are often repeat visitors and are attracted to facilities that make their 
arrival 
and departure easy
. 
A casino in a competitive market with accessibility advantages will 
likely be more profitable by virtue of having more customers.
 

 
Management quality
 

 
Operating efficiency is critical in gaming operations due to the 
high fixed c
ost nature of the business
. 
Maximizing revenues is a key to successful 
operations of such businesses, so management skill in cost control and efficient 
marketing can make dramatic differences in operating margins and profitability
.
 
Profitability 
within t
he
 
Casino
 
Casinos are complex operations
,
 
in that there are many types of gaming and non
-
gaming 
operations occurring within the envelope of the casino development
. 
This mix can vary 
significantly depending on the type of operation 

 
destination vs. local, sl
ots vs. tables vs. full 
service, 
standalone
 
casino or a project with many amenities
. 
 
Generally, slots are the biggest contributor to profitability due to their low operating cost
. 
There is little labor involved other than maintenance since the advent of t
icket
-
in
/
ticket
-
out 
technology
. 
Additionally, individual slot machines take up little room on the floor
. 
Before 
considering gaming taxes, slots
-
only casino operations tend to generate among the highest returns 
on capital as they tend to have fewer amenitie
s. 
The marg
ins on 
net 
slot 
revenue 
can vary wid
e
ly 
depending on the tax rate and regulatory requirements.
 
Tables generate higher individual bets than slots and the house retains a greater percentage 
in the individual gaming transaction, but table game tran
sactions are much slower than the pull of 
a slot machine so calibrating the mix of tables and slots relative to demand is critical
. 
Given the 
amount of labor required between dealers, supervisors, security personnel and cleaners, tables are 
generally less 
profitable than slots
. 
An exception to this might be in extraordinarily high volume 
markets like Macau, where table games are the largest profit makers.
 
The m

Hotel rooms may generate high operating margins in markets of ultra
-
high occupancy, but

Florida has an active land

,
 
with 
seven Native American 
casino operations and 
six
 
South Florida 
slot
s
-
only casinos
 
at racetracks and jai alai frontons
 

Three of the Native American 
casinos
 
are located in Broward County and 
one each in Miami, Tampa, Immokalee and Ok
eechobee
. 
The Seminole Tribe
 
of Florida 
operates 
all of the Native American 
casinos
 
except
 
the Miami 
casino
, 
which is owned and 
operated by the 
Miccosukee Tribe
 
of Indians of Florida. 
Each of the 
South Florida racinos
 
also offers poker, as do 
the majority 
of the pari
-
mutuel facilities 
elsewhere in
 
the state. There is also one s
mall Native 
American
-
owned slots facility 
in Clewiston on the southwest corner of Lake Okeechobee (
a 5,600
-
square foot facility
 
with 
a few
 
slot machines), 
although we consider this to
 
be 
too small to be truly 
defined as
 
a casino

Florida had a total population of

more than

, either

State
wide, there are also 
a handful of
 
casino cruises departing daily from ports through
out 
the state, some of which provide 
overnight cruises to the Bahamas and others which 
solely provide 
day
-
cruise
 
excursions into international waters for gaming
. T
he casino 
cruise industry in Florida 
is in a constant st
ate of flux, generally downward. Ten
 
years ago there were far more casino cruises 
in operation, but 
the industry niche has
 
not fared well competing against land
-
based 
operations.
 
The 
racinos report their
 
slot revenues to the State each month,
 
which publishes the figures; 
Native American casino data are not published. 
The
 
racinos
 
also face a significant tax differential 
relative to the Native American 
casinos. 
Initially, 
racino slot revenue was
 
taxed at 50
 
percent
 
of 
net gaming revenues
, 
ex
cluding distributions to local governments
. 
Effective 
July 1, 2011,
 
the 
racino tax 
rate was lowered to 35 percent
 
of GGR 
net of promotional credits and unclaimed tickets
.
 
The Seminole Tribe historically 
(pre
-
2010) paid no
 
gaming taxes, but was permitted to 
operate only 
Class II 
slots and Class II table games (non
-
house
-
banked games). In 2010, the 
Seminole Tribe signed a 20
-
year compact with 
the 
S
tate of Florida
 
under which the Seminole Tribe
 
agreed to pay the State an aggr
egate total of $1 billion over the first five years of the compact 
(effectively less than 10 percent of gross gaming revenue), and potentially as much as $1.5 billion 
based on an additional revenue
-
sharing component for the right to offer house
-
banked tabl
e games 
at its casinos in Hollywood, Immokalee and Tampa, with an option to add table games at its 

continue to operate Las Vegas
-
style slot machines for the next 
20 years with no additional slot 
competition allowed outside of Broward and Miami
-
Dade counties, and that no Class III table 
games would be permitted anywhere else in the state.
 
Through 2012
, we estimate that total GGR from the 1
3
 
racinos and Native Americ
an 
casinos
 
in Florida 
was
 
at least $2.
7
 
billion
:
 

 
The six racinos publicly reported GGR of $527.6 million in 2012 (from an average of 
6,327 slot machines over the course 
of 
the annual period and more than 140 poker 
tables). At year
-
end there were 6,393 slot
 
machines and 147 poker tables operating.
 
o
 
Gross slot revenue was $489.2 million (92.7 percent of GGR), while average 
slot win per unit per day was $211;
 
o
 
Total cardroom revenue was $38.3 million (7.3 percent of GGR), while 
average win per table per day was 
$713;
 
o
 
Average GGR per gaming position per day was approximately $198.
 

 
We 
estimate
 
the seven Native American casinos 
last year generated GGR of
 
$2.2 billion.

This estimate is based on two percent annual growth from the 2011 reported 
figure of $2.16 billion

gaming positions having $374 in GGR per position per day).

It should be noted that some expansion at Native American casinos has 
occurred since 2011, such that in aggregate, we 
estimate
 
there are were at
 
least 
14,500 slot machines and 450 table games (or 17,200 gaming positions) at 
Native American casinos in Florida in 2012.

Casinos (Commercial, Racetrack, Indian)
 
There are nearly 1,000 casinos in t
he United States, and in 2012 they generated an 
estimated $66 billion
86
 

net losses of $66 billion in US casinos last year. Casinos are the highest
-
grossing form of legal 
gambling in the 
country, having surpassed lottery sales.
 
In this section we provide an overview of various aspects and components of an industry 
that, from an economic perspective, has been highly successful.

The modern casino industry began in 
Nevada, 
which
 
was the first state to legalize casino 
gaming

While casinos grew in the state it was not u

El Rancho Vegas Hotel

Casino
, 
was built 
on Highway 91
. This came to be known 
as the Las Vegas Strip
 
and is now home 

the total GGR in the state of Nevada. 
It then took until 1976 
for another gaming jur
isdiction to be 
legalized 
when New Jersey voters 
passed a voter referendum for a constitutional amendment to 
utilize privately owned casinos to revitalize Atlantic City 

 


 
that 
was in severe decline. This dynamic 

 
economic r
ecovery, urban renewal or Tribal self
-
sufficiency 

 
has been one of the primary driving forces in the expansion of gaming throughout the 
United 
States
. 
 
The following table provides a state

state breakout of the types of casino gambling. Of 
note, this r
eview and analysis does not include a discussion of lotteries even though the 
proliferation of slot machines at racetracks is frequently operated under the auspices of the 
respective state lottery commissions. In the sections that follow we will provide a 
discussion of 
the various forms of casinos.

Note the second column in the 
above
 
table, which indicates the year that commercial 
casinos were legalized in each state and note that most of the legislation was passed around the 
time of economic recessions in the 
United States
.
87
 
Of note, the legalization of casinos in Atlantic 
City followed the 16
-
month November 1973 recession
 
(although Atlantic City was in such a 
depressed state that it defied economic cycles)
, and the eight
-
month July 1990 to March 1991 
recession can be conside
red as the impetus for the legalization of casinos in Colorado, Illinois, 
Louisiana and Mississippi. As previously indicated, economic recovery has been one of the leading 
reasons states and municipalities enact gaming legislation and casino gaming has bec
ome an 
economic mainstay in many communities. 
 
The gaming industry is known for substantial capital investment in facilities, with the size 
and scale of the investment dependent upon potential returns that are, in turn, dependent upon 
population and visita
tion, regulations and proposed tax rate, to name a few factors that are 
considered in such investment decisions. 
 
This investment creates construction jobs during the development phase of the project, 
followed by long
-
term job creation to staff the propert
ies and service the customers. As an 
example, Tunica County, MS, was the poorest county in the country 

 
53 percent living below the 
poverty line and 15 percent unemployment 

 

Jackson in 1985.
88
 
The first
 
casinos opened in Tunica in 1992 and by 1994 when 
U.S. News and 
World Report
 
revisited Tunica, 95 percent of all adults were working. The county budget, which 
was under $3 million before the casinos commenced operations, is just under $50 million for fisc
al 
year 2013.

Farther south in Biloxi, MS
,
 
the experience was much the same. 
At the opening of 
the new Isle of Capri casino in Biloxi, MS, CEO Bernie Goldstein is quoted in his autobiography 
as, 

stic applicants. One in every 10 
Mississippi workers was unemployed at the time, and we were offering outstanding salaries, 

90
 
The commercial casino industry
91
 
is large and growing. While this statement might seem 
counte
rintuitive given the challenges the industry faced during the economic recession and with 
certain companies still facing an uncertain future due to highly levered balance sheets, the fact 
remains that the gaming industry in the 
United States
 
has expanded t
o new jurisdictions, invested

Recession in June 2009.
92
 
The commercial industry generated $37.3 billion in GGR in 2012, 
slightly 
below the 2007 peak revenue of $37
.5 billion. Much of this growth can be credited to the 
expansion of gaming to new jurisdictions 

 
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kansas are examples 

 
or new 
properties opening in existing jurisdictions 

 
Resorts World New York, Rivers Casino Des Plaines 
(Illinois
) and SugarHouse (Philadelphia) 

 
but some of it can also be ascribed to the improving 
economy and stabilizing housing sector providing consumers with the confidence to again visit 
and spend in casinos.

Today, 26 states have legalized commercial casinos of some type. As the casino industry 
expanded into other states and regions it has also evolved. To make casino gaming palatable to an 
electorate whose only exposure to the industry was from movies like 
Th
e Godfather
 
or 
Bugsy
, 
states enacted legislation with certain requirements, such as limits on the number of gaming 
positions or the imposition of bet limits. In Colorado the casinos are only allowed in the former 
mining towns of Black Hawk, Central City an
d Cripple Creek
,
 
and the casinos have architecture 
common to pre
-
World War I Colorado. Iowa riverboats must replicate 19
th
 
C
entury Mississippi 
steamships. 
 
As the electorate became more comfortable with the industry
, which
 
contributed 
employment and raised
 
revenue, many jurisdictions began to loosen regulations so that the in
-
state 
casino industry could continue to be competitive against the new casino jurisdictions being enacted 
th
roughout the country. The Iowa L
egislature voted in 1993 to remove bet and l
oss limits and 

93
 
Missouri removed its loss

limits in 2008. Colorado raised the maximum bet limit from $5 to $100 in 2009. Over the years, 
the requirement that riverboats cruise has been 
removed in all riverboat markets. 
 
Because of the way regulations were written with riverboats enjoying monopoly
-
like status 
surrounded by other casinos throughout the state, most of the new jurisdictions became day
-
trip 
markets where customers drove from 
within a small radius, typically 50 to 75 miles, and stayed at 
each property for only a few hours. Properties located in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and Mississippi 
operated under different regulations that created a critical mass of properties and lower tax 
rates 
that incented the property owners to invest in larger facilities with hotels, more expansive food 
and beverage offerings, nightlife, entertainment and convention space. In the early part of the 
industry life cycle, the majority of the casino property

gaming floor. Today, and especially for these larger properties, casino gambling now represents 
less than half of revenue.

Evolution of Destination Resort Casinos
 
As casinos expanded t
o other parts of the country
,
 
they 
introduced the industry to new 
customers and drove increased visitation to Las Vegas and, to a 
lesser extent, Atlantic City. With 
the financial backing of the Wall Street high
-
yield bond markets, developers, particularly in Las 
Vegas, but also in Atlantic City and Mississippi, invested in larger and more luxurious properties. 
We classify these casin

to interpretation, but Spectrum views it to be one with a critical mass of hotel rooms (typically

Because there are more activities than gaming,

properties, which often have no hotel at all.
 
Stated another way, at full occupancy there would
 
likely
 
be more peopl
e staying at a destination property than could be satisfied by the number of 
gaming positio
ns. Thus, by design, there need
 
to be more activities to keep the guests satisfied. 
The following table provides a snapshot of the ratio of rooms per gaming position
 
for the 
destination, regional destination or day

trip property. The average number of rooms/gaming 
position for a destination casino is 1.75 rooms/gaming position, which is more than three times the 
ratio for a regional destination casino and a little ove
r 10 times the ratio for the day

hotel
. This higher room count leads to more people in a property with a longer length of stay and 
higher spend/visit. Just adding hotel rooms will not ensure occupancy. It is the addition of other 
high

ties that draws the customers to the property with the demand justifying the larger 
hotel offering.

The amenities we cited
 
are
 
within the control of the property developer. Despite 
their
 
beachfront setting
s
, Atlantic City and Biloxi have been unable to compete with Las Vegas for 
international 
visitors, because of factors outside the control of the developer. Of particular 
importance is accessibility to each respective market. Simply put, Atlantic City International 
Airport and the Gulfport
-
Biloxi International Airport do not 

 
and cannot with t
heir current 
infrastructure 

 
provide the same airlift as McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. In 2012, 
there were 41.7 million air passengers in Las Vegas,
95
 
while data from the Atlantic City 
Convention and Visitors Authority indicate that Atlantic
 
City International Airport has more than 
1 million annual passengers
96
 
and Gulfport
-
Biloxi air passengers were less than 1 million in 
2012.
97
 
As such, we consider Las Vegas to be a national destination market, while both Atlantic 
City and Biloxi are regiona
l destinations. Because of the critical mass of casino properties, 
combined with hotels and other amenities these two markets can draw from further away and for 
a longer stay duration than the primarily day
-
trip riverboats, but do not draw customers from a
s 
far or as long as Las Vegas.

Evolution to Hub and Spoke Business Model
 
The evolution of commercial casino gaming in the United States has evolved over a period 
of decades from a policy in which some states allowed casino licensees to cluster in 
a 
central
 
location (Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey) to one in which most states issue fewer licenses, giving 
some regional exclusivity, but balancing that with a relatively high tax rate. As the following table 
shows, the trend for higher tax rates has been rather
 
strong, with few exceptions:

T
ax rates are often 
set on the ba
sis of political considerations
 
rather than through an 
economic analysis. This is best illustrated through the anecdotal example of New Jersey, which 
today is viewed as a low
-
tax state, but did not start out that way.
 
In 2010, Spectrum authore
d a peer
-
reviewed white paper on tax policy
99
 
that included the 
following:
 
New Jersey was the first state outside Nevada to legalize casinos, with voters approving a 
November 1976 referendum to authorize casinos in Atlantic City
. 
The enabling legislation, 
t
he Casino Control Act, was approved eight months later, and the first casino opened in

Some states have different rates for table games or other exceptions. This lists only the highe
st rates in 
such states. Some rates have been subsequently adjusted, but this highlights the political trends regarding the 
adoption of rates.

In researching this paper, we asked Steven P.
 
Perskie 

 
who was a member of the state 
Assembly in 1976 and 1977, and is widely hailed as the architect of the Casino Control Act 

 
to provide the thought processes that guided the decision to set the rate at 8 percent. He 
responded with the following wr
itten comment:
 

found that the highest (combined) tax on gross revenues was 7.5 percent (in Nevada)
. 
For 
principally political reasons, we therefore set the initial
 
rate for New Jersey at 8 percent
. 
We assumed that this would inoculate us from any argument in either direction (that the 
tax was too high or too low), and indeed we never had to defend that decision
. 
We didn't, 
at that time, make any effort to calculate 
the revenue estimates for the state, as we had no 
idea (and, as experience would show, we had 
no
 
idea) what we would be dealing with

gaming did not evolve based o
n market demand or player preferences. Still, the market did respond 
to these political arguments. In large measure, that evolution prompted the gaming industry to 

 
Under this model, one comp
any would operate multiple properties. The higher

properties that are isolated in various regions would attract local business and develop databases 
of players within their respective regions. As these databases grow, players who earn loyalty points

r, and thus the profit margin is
 
higher.
 
Caesars Entertainment embodies this model, and arguably pioneered the concept and 
developed it. Under this m
odel, Caesars leverages its multiple locations, with spoke properties in 
feeder markets, and hub properties in markets such as Las Vegas and Atlantic City, as well as 
leveraging its loyalty program, known as Total Rewards.
 
In a recent column in 
Global Gami
ng Business
 
magazine, Caesars Chairman, President and 
CEO Gary Loveman described the core of the program:
 
Many commentators have identified Total Rewards as the leading loyalty program in the 
gaming industry. We agree that Total Rewards provides Caesars wi
th some unique 
advantages. No other program allows patrons to earn reward credits or points at one 
property in Las Vegas, for example, and redeem them inside the casino in New Orleans or 

the French Quarter. No

and on four continents around the world, all of which create marketing opportunities 
for our home communities. 
 
Currently, there are more t

have taken advantage of the program, 8 million of whom have been active in the past 12 
months. The program provides for four tier cards or levels based on activity of the guest, 
with each card hav

or by using our Total Rewards

Others are moving in the same direction. The Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, which 
began with a hub property at its Connecticut casino, has since branched out to a spoke in 
Pennsylvania, is a
pplying for a resort destination license in Massachusetts, is managing a casino 
in Atlantic City, and seeking to manage casinos elsewhere. A Florida example is the Seminole 
Hard Rock, which is developing plans to leverage its national brand in gaming marke
ts such as 
Massachusetts and New Jersey, as well as in hotel markets. Hard Rock Chairman
 
Jim Allen
 
identified between eight and 15 markets that could potentially support a Hard Rock hotel casino, 
and as many as 50 markets that could support a Hard Rock hot
el.
103
 
A recent article on 
HotelNewsNow.com noted: 
 
Hard Rock, 
which now has 18 properties in its portfolio, could triple that number over the 
next three to five years, Chairman Jim Allen told HotelNewsNow.com.
 

 
Globally, Hard Rock has secured relationships
 
with development partners in 58 countries, 
Allen said.

Other operators, including those with properties in Florida, acknowledge the benefits of 
the model

Notably, while the hub
-
and
-
spoke business is still evolving and has yet to reach its full 
potential, new models are emerging. Indeed, Caesars is pioneering a 
model that Loveman recently 
detailed:
 
Policymakers and social scientists increasingly understand that casino development 
projects offer the most economic and social benefits when they are specifically tailored to 
the needs of their host communities. The lo
ng
-
held view that casinos exist across a 
spectrum anchored at one end by neighborhood slot parlors and other forms of convenience 
gaming and at the other end by integrated destination resort casinos has become 
incomplete. 
 
Over the past decade, a third dim
ension of casino gaming has emerged in North America 
that provides another option for urban policymakers to consider. 
 
I call this model the city
-
integrated or urban resort. Its defining feature is integration with 

-
existing business comm
unity and attractions. In this model, the casino 
itself is both a physical and a metaphorical hub. Its spokes radiate not only to amenities in 
the casino complex itself, but also to established restaurants, shops, hotels and recreation 
offerings in the lar
ger metro
politan area.
106
 
 
This analysis should note that, while the hub
-
and
-
spoke model is still developing, a new 
business model may be forming in its wake. Whether the future includes new urban resorts or 
traditional destination resorts, the goals for pol
icymakers remain unchanged: Capital investment 
remains the key target. Consider that a destination property 

 


 
will likely 
employ at least 3,000 full
-

which focuses o
n its nearby adult population, will employ about 800, and possibly as many as 
1,000.
 
All else being equal, a destination resort is more likely to:
 

 
Promote tourism, as it has the ability to pull adults from more distant locations.
 

 
Withstand competition, sin
ce it typically offers more amenities.
 

 
Generate more revenue, since it will likely penetrate a greater percentage of the adult 
population.
 
One corollary to this trend is that properties that begin life as convenience
-
oriented 
facilities, which would includ
e so
-

category in perpetuity.
 
For example, Dover Downs 

 
a racino in southern Delaware 

 
responded to the threat of 
competition from nearby Maryland, as well as from Pennsylvania and New Jersey, by adding a 
232
-
room hotel and conference center, along with a combination ballroom/concert
 
hall, a new fine
-
dining restaurant, pool and spa. The property also added a 425
-
seat buffet, among other 
investments. 
That investment helped the property weather competition, by becoming something

62
 
 
closer to a destination. The expansion has continued, and 
the facility now has 500 rooms, and 
significantly more amenities.
107
 
In Florida, Gulfstr
eam has significantly expanded
, starting with the addition of the 1
-
million
-
square
-
foot Village at Gulfstream, which includes 750,000 square feet of retail space. That 
pr
operty continues to expand, with plans now for a $700 million expansion
108
 
that would include 
hotel rooms. As described by the 
Sun
-
Sentinel

Stronach Group includes two hotels facing the track, greatly enlarged g
randstand seating, as well 
as a 
standalone
 
casino and adjacent concert hall. A giant statue of Pegasus will adorn a 4D theater 
nearby in a park area. 
But here's the most surprising aspect of a project that will 
cost 
hundreds of 
millions of dollars to comp
lete: Public money is not part of the equation.

109
 
In one sense, properties such as Dover Downs and Gulfstream are defying the basic 
economics of hubs vs. spokes in that such properties are burdened by relatively high tax rates, 
which tend to discourage suc
h investments by reducing the potential returns on investment. Yet, 
in another sense, such properties recognize that such investments can protect 

 
or even enhance 

 
market share.
 
We do not suggest, however, that destination gaming resorts are panaceas, no
r do we ignore 
the downside or the challenges they present to local communities. By definition, they increase 
traffic and create other demands on public services. The more successful they are in generating 
revenue, the more such demands increase.
 
In 2009, 
Spectrum studied in great detail the economic and social impacts of two 
destination resorts in Connecticut on their local communities. The two tribal properties 

 
Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun 

 
were responsible for $1.2 
billion 
worth of personal income in 
Conn
ecticut, both directly and indirectly. Between 1992 and 2008, they accounted for about 12 
percent of the net new job growth in Connecticut.
110
 
 
At the same time, however, DUI arrests were up significantly. One town reported that such 
arrests doubled since th
e first casino opened in 1992, and three local communities reported that 20 
percent of those arrested for DUI 

 
including one motorist arrested for manslaughter for causing a

Native American Casinos
 
Nationally
 
Congress passed 
the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (

IGRA

)
 
because many 
Native American nations and tribes had established gaming ac
tivities but federal laws at the time 
did not establish a clear regulatory framework for the conduct of such games. IGRA was passed 
to fulfill certain goals, including promoting tribal economic development, self
-
sufficiency and 
strong tribal governments; m
aintain
ing
 
the integrity of the Native American gaming industry; and

ensuring that tribes are the primary beneficiaries of their gaming activities.
114
 
Under IGRA, 
games 
are classified into three categories: Class I, Class II and Class III.
 

 
Class I gaming inc
ludes social games solely for prizes of minimal value or traditional 
forms of Indian gaming engaged in by individuals as part of tri
bal ceremonies or 
celebrations.
 

 
Class II gaming includes bingo, pull
-
tabs, lotto, punch boards, tip jars, certain non
-
banked
 
card games (if such games are played legally elsewhere in the state), instant 
bingo and other games similar to bingo, if those games are played at the same 
location 
where bingo is played.
 

 
Class III gaming, meanwhile, includes all other forms of gaming, su
ch as slot machines, 
video casino games (video blackjack and video poker), table games and other 
commercial gaming, such as sports betting and pari
-
mutuel wagering. To of
fer Class III 
games, federally recognized
 
Indian tribes are required to negotiate a co
mpact with the 
state in which they operate and attain approval of the compact by the US Department of 
the Interior.
115
 
As in the commercial casino industry, the type of Native American casino is also varied, 
with the Seminole Hard Rock casinos, Foxwoods and 
Mohegan Sun being examples of national 
destination resorts. According to the National Indian Gaming Commission
,
 
there were over 420 
Nat
ive American casinos generating more than
 
$27.2 billion in GGR in 2011.

eight
 
Native American casinos are spread throughout five counties (Broward, 
Collier, Hillsborough, Glades, and Miami
-
Dade), while Broward is home to three of the Native 
American casinos. 
 
Native American casinos in Florida, for the most part, provide a full
-
ser
vice gaming 
experience, although non
-
card games such as craps or roulette are not allowed. The Indian casinos, 
however, are not subject to state regulation and thus have substantial competitive advantages over 
racinos including allowing patrons to smoke, o
ffering live table games (except at Miccosukee, 
which is a Class II property) and paying no direct gaming tax.
116
 
While there are two federally recognized tribes in Florida, the Seminole Tribe is dominant, 
and indeed Seminole Gaming is largely viewed as more
 
than a Fl
orida operation. As noted in 
Chapter II(B)(6)(c),
 
by virtue of its ownership of Hard Rock International the Tribe is branching 
out with Hard Rock
-
branded casinos in other states. Notably, the Seminole Tribe has secured 
investment
-
grade rating for
 
its debt, as noted by Fitch, a major rating agency:
 

s 
[Seminole Tribe of Florida] 
operating profile and credit metrics 
are consistent with 'BBB

At least two other 
Indian 
tribes are working t
hrough various legal channels to commence

gaming operations
:
 

 
The Poarch Band of Creek Indians, which is based in Atmore, AL, has land in Escambia 
County, which is held in trust by the US government, and also owns, or has options to 
own, or agreemen
ts to control 10 pari
-
mutuel permits along the Interstate 10 corridor 
between Pensacola and Jacksonville. The Poarch Band is seeking to negotiate an 
agreement, which could include revenue
-
sharing, with the State to operate Class II 
gaming (i.e., bingo

base
d slots and non

house

The tribe 
currently operates three casinos (with electronic gaming machines only) in Alabama.
 

 
For the past decade
,
 
the Muscogee Nation of Florida has been pursuing federal 
recognition by act of Congress in order to initia
te gaming operations as a means of 
economic development. Tribal landholdings are well positioned to offer casino gaming 
in an underserved tourism market close to Gulf beaches in the Florida panhandle, where 
the nearest competition are greyhound tracks in P
ensacola and Ebro. In 2003 US 
Representative Jeff Miller, Republican from Florida, introduced House Resolution 323, 

120
 
This bill, 
which has never been voted on, was assigned to the House Nat
ural Resources, Indian 
and Alaskan Native Affairs Committee on January 13, 2013.
121
 
It has received repeated 
extensions over the past 10 years. The last extension was granted in December 2012, 
and expires in early June. It is our understanding that current p
rospects for recognition 
through Congress are not promising.

National Trends
 
In pari
-
mutuel wagering, bettors bet against each other. The house has no stake in the 
outcome. The house takes out a portion of the amount wagered, which in racing is
 
known as handle. 
Racetracks typically retain
 
about 20 percent of handle
. 
 
National trends mirror th
ose
 
of Florida. L
ive handle in calendar year 2010 (the most recent 
year
 
for which data are
 
available) accounted for just 12 percent of total handle for horse racing, 29 
percent for greyhound racing and 42 percent for
 
jai 
alai handle.
122
 
For the 10
-
year period ending 
in 2010, pari
-
mutuel wagering fell from $18.3 billion in 2000 to $11.5 billion in
 
2010, a decline 
of 37 percent. State

 
revenue fell from $470 million to $191 million, a decline of 59 
percent.

Certainly, the creation of new wagering opportunities over the last several decades has 
given more adults more options. The history is summarized 
well in this excerpt from a report by 
Cummings Associates
:
 
When they were first authorized in some states in the 1930s, and for a long golden age 
thereafter, race tracks essentially had a monopoly on legal gambling on a commercial scale. 
They were legalize
d because states needed money. During the economic collapse of the 
Great Depression, a number of states turned to legal gambling as a source of revenue. 
Nevada legalized casinos (in 1931), but every other state chose pari
-
mutuel betting on 
horse racing, an
d in a few states, on greyhound racing as well. This occurred, moreover, in 
the context of relatively simple leisure economies which, aside from movies and major 
league baseball, offered few alternative forms of commercial entertainment. In these 
circumsta
nces, race tracks were by and large highly profitable. As businesses, horse tracks 
had little trouble developing large numbers of customers and were able to pay high rates 

 
Over the past thirty years, however, the economic environment has changed dramatically. 
Competing forms of legal gambling have proliferated, starting with state lotteries in the 
late 1960s. Ironically, the same force that legalized racing led to lotteries:
 
states needed 
money. Thirty
-
nine states now have them, and all the provinces of Canada. ... 
 
Then came an explosion of full
-
scale casino resort hotels in Las Vegas, New Jersey, 
Mississippi, Canada and Connecticut. These now attract tens of billions of dol
lars in 



 
a widespread basis 
in several Western states and much of Canada, on cruise ships operating out of many states, 

 

 
size; in the 1990s, 
it more than doubled again
. 
Over the same period, the U.S. leisure economy grew 
enormously and became vastly more diversified. Many leisure and entertainment activities 
are available today that did not exist in the 1930s, or even in th
e 1960s. Cable television, 
VCRs, DVDs, inexpensive air travel and the related (but not
-
so
-
inexpensive) theme park 
resort industries, major

in Florida.
 
Pari
-
mutuel activities in Florida include thoroughbred 
horse racing, harness
 
horse racing, 
quarter
 
horse racing, greyhound racing
 
and
 
jai alai
 
games
. In addition, pari
-
mutuel facilities 
can
 
operate
 
cardrooms, which can only be operated by the holder of a pari
-
mutuel license
 
(though card 
games do not involve pari
-
mutuel wagering)
. Cardrooms cannot open in a facility unless live 
racing or jai first takes place.
129
 
Events at racing and 
jai ala
i
 
facilities are simulcast to other pari
-
mutuel facilities in Florida and to out
-
of
-
state venues. 
 
Florida is the only state with live jai alai games. It is one of seven states with greyhound 
racing
. 

eyhound races in 2010.
130
 
Since 
1993, 10 states have outlawed greyhound racing.
131
 
Florida allows slot machine casinos,
 
also known as racinos, at pari
-
mutuel facilities in 
Miami
-
Dade and Broward counties. Numerous pari
-
mutuel operators in other areas of the st
ate 

compete with racinos in and outside of Florida that use slot revenue to enhance purses, which, in 
turn, allow racinos to attract higher quality
 
racing
 
an
imals and make significant capital 
expenditures to improve their facilities
. 
 
As
 
of April 3, 2013, there were 2
7
 
pari
-
mutuel facilities in Florida 
(plus inter
-
track at 
Ocala) 
that accepted bets on live races or 
jai alai games. They included 14
 
greyhound tr
acks, six 
jai alai
 
frontons, three thoroughbred tracks, one harness track and 
five
 
quarter horse tracks. 
Twenty
-
four of them had cardrooms. Six had casinos. Ocal

estbet 
in Jacksonville operate simulcast parlors without live 
p
ari
-
mutuel 
racing. The overall financial 
trend for Florida pari
-
mutuels has been on a steady downward spiral. Many operations have 
sustained steep operating income losses, and those losses would have been much greater if it were 
not for racino and cardroom
 
revenue. The worst
-
performing sectors have been jai alai and 
greyhound.

mutuel facilities had a combined overall operating profit of just 
$1.9 million. Thirteen had losses
,
 
with the
 
largest of $21.6 million at the combined Fort

operation
. The biggest operating profit was $16.4 million at Flagler 
Greyhound Track, which also operates 
slot machines
.
132
 
Pari
-
mutuel operations involve wagering on pari
-
mutuel events. The wagers occur at the 
track on live events or a
t track simulcast rooms. Those operations by themselves sustained an 
operating loss of $50 million. Only eight facilities were able to show an operating profit from their 
pari
-
mutuel operations.
133
 
The largest 
loss of $11.6 million was at Fort
 
Pierce/Miami; 
the highest 
profit of $6.3 million was at Gulfstream, a thoroughbred track with 
slot machines
.
 
State tax revenue
 
from such operations
 
is fraction of what it once was. From FY 1985 to 
FY 2012, it fell from:
 

 
$29.7 million to $378,000 for 
jai a
lai, a 
reduction of 99 percent
134
 

 
$77.2 million to $3.7 million for greyhound racing, a reduction of 99 percent
135
 

 
$12.5 million to $7.6 million for horse racing, a reduction of 39 percent
136
 
The overall reduction in state revenue went from 
$119.4 million to $11.8 mill
ion
, decline 
of 
91 percent
.
137
 
Slot machine casinos accounted for 77 percent of state gaming revenue in FY 2012. All of 
that slot machine money
, $144 million,
 
was given to the state Department of Education. Unclaimed 
jai alai a
nd greyhound winning tickets to
taling $1 million was 
also given to that 
same 
state agency. 
State tax revenue from c
ardroom
s was split between 
the Pari
-
Mutuel Wagering Trust Fund and the
 
General Revenue Fund. In accordance with 
s
ection 849.086(13)(h), Florida Statutes, one
-
quarter 
of the
 
moneys deposited into the Pari
-
Mutuel Wagering Trust Fund must be distributed to counties 
and
 
municipalities that approved the cardroom. In October 2012, the division distributed

Issues with
 
PMW Annual Reports
 
In the course of our research, we discovered that purse numbers for the Isle of Capri at 
Pompano harness track were grossly overstated in PMW annual reports for fiscal years 2009 
through 2012.
 
PMW stated to us 
by
 
e
mail that it will be revising annual reports for Pompano to 
reflect the accurate figures. The mistakes were discovered when we asked standardbred horsemen 
to review purse information. The horsemen claimed that the numbers were wrong, and PMW asked 
the Pomp

errors had been made, and PMW said that the annual reports will be amended. The agency makes 
no effort to independently verify the information. The errors for the Isle of Capr
i at Pompano data 
raise issues as to whether other mistakes could have occurred at other pari
-
mutuel facilities.
 
In an email to Spectrum on May 21, 2013, PMW officials acknowledged that a
nnual PMW 
reports fail to include 
out
-
of
-
state generated 
simulcast re
venue
.
 
Gulfstream, for example, might 
send its signal to Yonkers, and revenue from wagers bet on Gu
lfstream races at Yonkers would 
not appear in PMW annual reports. The result is a significant understatement of simulcast 
revenues
. To illustrate the point, 
PMW

report 
lists 
simulcast and intertrack 
handle 
for 
Gulfstream 
at 
$102 million. 
But missing was out
-
of
-
state generated 
simulcast handle 
of 
$605,319,440
, an amount that is nearly six times the reported simulcast handle in the PMW FY 
report of 2012.
139
 
Other racing jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, include out
-
of
-
state export handle 
in their annual reports. The failure 
of PMW to indicate in its annual report that handle figures fail 
to include this category
 
results in a
n incomplete picture of racing wa
gering
 
in Florida. In a May 
23 email to Spectrum, PMW explained it does 
not 
do so because the 
wagers made outside of 
Florida are beyond 
its 
regulatory authority 
and ability to impose taxes. PMW officials also noted 
they are unable to verify the data.
 
Also 
unreported in out
-
of
-
state generated simulcast revenue is 
the amount through the Oregon hubs, which are companies that allow gamblers to place bets on 
races through the 
Internet
 
or a cell phone. 
 
PMW includes a category in its annual report identifying the
 
amount of purses accounted 

-

financial contributions made by the operator. For example, the Melbourne Greyhound track 
contributed $185,463 from pari
-
mutuel operations
 
toward purses, according to the FY 2012 
report.
140
 
Yet the annual report shows that the entire handle was only $162,138, and only half of 
that goes into purses.
141
 
If the operator is making a 
contribution toward purses, 
reports 
should 
indicate that the figure
 
includes such contributions.

It is critical for policymakers to have information relating to regulatory costs for each pari
-
mutuel sector. PMW told us in emails it cannot break down costs by sector. We note that Rep. 
Dana Young, R
-
57, asked the state agen
cy for regulatory financial data relating to greyhound 
racing.
 
In a letter dated August 19, 2011, Ken Lawson, Secretary of the Department of Business 

live g

than the revenues of $1.85 million that live greyhound racing generated. But the expense figure 
did not include any allocation for salaries and benefits paid to 66 P
MW employees or expenses 
they incurred. Those two categories alone totaled $4.7 million.
 
The Legislature needs to have 
detailed information concerning regulatory costs by sector in order for it to make informed 
decisions concerning the pari
-
mutuel industry
.
 
Cutting Costs
 
Some operators say they have been adversely affected by a requirement that forces them 
to run a minimum number of racing performances (eight races make up a performance). Two 
greyhound tracks are conducting more than 350 performances a year
, close to what they ran nearly 
20 years ago because of the 90 percent rule. This rule requires pari
-
mutuel operators with 
cardrooms to conduct at least 90 percent of the live performances that were held the year before 
their cardrooms opened.
142
 
For many op
erators, that was 1996. Florida had 3,857 live greyhound 
performances in 
2010; West Virginia, the next
-
highest state, had 552.
143
 
The required minimum 
number of performances varies from sector to sector, and then within a specific sector depending 
on when a 
facility opened. This issue will be addressed in more detail later in the report.
 
Some
 
operators have 
responded to the cost of doing business b
y reduc
ing 
race cards and, 
in the case of 
jai alai, the number of players on a roster. Others have used quar

two dogs in each race

Decline 
o
f Purses, Handle
 
Purses are awarded to dog and horse racing owners who win races. They have declined 
slightly in recent years but the decline would have been much greater if it were not for revenue 
from slot machine and cardroom 
operations. The recen
t return of traditional quarter
-
horse racing 
in November 2009 at Hialeah 
Park
 
also boosted overall purse numbers.
147
 
Total Florida pari
-
mutuel handle fell from $1.8 billion in FY 1990 to $876 million in FY 
2012, a decline of 51 percent; 
live handle (the amount wagered by patrons at a host track where 
live racing was held) fell from $1.8 billion to $190 million, a decline of 95 percent; performances 
fell from 6,931 to 4,904, a decline of 41 percent and paid attendance fell from 15.3 millio
n to 
381,000, a decline of 83 percent.
148
 
Simulcasting first came to Florida on August 17, 1990
,
 
when Daytona Beach Kennel Club 
transmitted races to the Sports Palace in Melbourne. Prior to then, Florida handle came exclusively 
from live handle.
149
 
 
Simulcast 
wagering
 
in Florida involves patrons 
visiting
 
a pari
-
mutuel facility and wagering 
on live races conducted at other racetracks in Florida or at out
-
of
-
state tracks. In other words, the 
racetrack signal is being sent or imported to a Florida track to let its
 
patrons bet on races/games at 
other facilities.
 
PMW categorizes intertrack handle as handle generated as a result of a Florida 
track/fronton exporting its signal to other Florida tracks or frontons, which enables patrons at those 
other Florida facilities 
receiving the signal to bet on those Florida races or games. Gulfstream, for 
example, would send its signal to the Palm Beach Kennel Club and patrons at the Palm Beach 
Kennel Club could then bet on those Gulfstream races. Intertrack involves only Florida
-
t
o
-
Florida 
facilities.
150
 

rebroadcasting of simulcast signals received by a Florida track/fronton, which then sends that 
signal to other Florida tracks/frontons. Gulfst
ream, for example, would receive a signal from

151
 
The largest single category of simulcasting involv
es the export of signals from Florida pari
-
mutuels to out
-
of
-
state facilities. Gulfstream, for example, would send its signal to Yonkers. No 
information is available from PMW for this category, which is often called out
-
of
-
state generated 
simulcast revenue
. The reason is because PMW does not track it. We note that other racing 
jurisdictions
,
 
such as New Jersey
, do so. Without the
s
e
 
data, it is not possible to offer a complete 
picture of simulcasting in Florida.
 
With 
the advent of simulcasting, live handle i
n Florida has accounted for less and less of 
total handle. By FY 2000, it accounted for 37.4 percent of total handle. Three years later, the figure 
fell to 29.7 percent
,
 
and for FY 2012 it was down to 24.3 percent.
152

Impact of Advance Deposit Wagering
 
(

AD
W

)
 
Adva
n
ce Deposit Wagering allows patrons to wager on racing (greyhound and horses) 
electronically. Patrons establish an account with an ADW company, and deposit money into the 
account prior to making any wagers. They can then place wagers from a compute
r, a home 
telephone or even a mobile phone.
 
ADW
 
companie
s have flourished in recent years 
primarily 
due to convenience. A gambler 
never has to leave his or her house to make a bet, and can do so from just about anywhere. In 
addition, the low overhead assoc
iated with ADWs enables these companies to offer rebates to 
customers based on their betting volume. Since the ADWs command so much betting volume, 
they are able to negotiate take
-
out rates with host tracks that are quite favorable. The amount 
wagered thro
ugh an ADW is funneled into the wagering pool of a host track
,
 
but Kent Stirling, 

and horsemen are often forced to split between 6
 
cents
 
and 9 cents of every dollar wagered through 
an ADW as opposed to 20 cents if the bet were made at a Florida racetrack on a live race.
153
 
 
Those 
ADW 
rebates can 
be as
 
much as 12 percent of what 
a 
gambler wagers
. Rob Wyre, 
general manager of the Isle of Capri
 
at Pompano Park, 
told Spectrum
 
racetracks cannot compete

75
 
 
The problem is exacerbated at the thoroughbred tracks in South Florid
a
,
 
as both Calder and 
Gulfstream are owned by companies that operate ADWs. According to Stirling, the television sets 
at Calder urge patrons to place their bets through an ADW. 
 
Most of the ADW firms have established themselves in Oregon through a hub netw
ork. At 
a time when handle across the country and especially in Florida has been decimated, the ADWs 
have flourished. 
Greyhound racing lobbyist Jack Cory said that the greyhounds are hurt much more 
by the Oregon hubs than horse racing. He noted that at lea
st with horse racing, some of that 
Oregon
-
hub money is split with the horsemen. The dog owners get nothing, he said. And, like the 
thoroughbreds, some greyhound
 
racetracks
 
operat
e
 
their own ADWs. These greyhound facilities 
encourage their patrons to place 
bets on live races through their ADWs, depriving the dog owners 
of revenues if the bet had been made at the track. 
 
Cory argues the handle is better than that painted by PMW annual reports as those reports 
fail to capture the Oregon
-
hub betting and the out
-
of
-
state generated handle, which is sizable.
 
 
The Oregon hub opened for business in 2000. Its total handle that year was just under $2 
million. In 2012, it had mushroomed to $2.24 billion. From 2007 to 2012, handle increased 47 
percent. During the same ti
me period, total pari
-
mutuel handle in Florida fell 41 percent and 
simulcasting handle (where patrons came to a Florida track and wagered on races held at other 
Florida tracks) fell by 59 percent.
154
 
Other Florida handle sectors sustained significant decline
s as 
well. Live handle at Florida pari
-
mutuels fell 46 percent from 2007 to 2012. 
 
Kentucky, another major racing state, is looking to tax the ADW companies on bets made 
in that state. A bill 
that 
passed a House subcommittee in February 
place
s
 
a tax of 0.5
 
percent 
on 
Internet and telephone wagers made by Kentucky residents. The state w
ill 
get 15
 
percent 
of the 
revenue, and racetracks and purse accoun
ts would get the remaining 85 percent. Kentucky expects 
the tax to generate as much as $400,000 a year.
155
 
Flor
ida pari
-
mutuels have also been adversely impacted by wagering 
through offshore 
outlets or tribal hubs that are not captured by regulatory agencies
 
at all. With the Oregon hubs, 
there is some revenue going back to the host 
thoroughbred and harness track an
d also 
to the state. 
But with the offshore hubs, the pari
-
mutuels and the state receive nothing. ACRI says there is 
good 
evidence that
 
such handle amounted to 
more than 
$1 billion in recent seasons
.

Flor
ida voters approved a statewide slots referendum in November 2004 that made it 
possible for slot machine casinos to come to Broward and Miami

Dade counties. Voters in 
Broward County then approved a slots referendum in 2005 and Miami

Dade voters approved on

in 2008.
 
As with handle, the source of Florida purse revenue 
 
has
 
dramatically changed over the
 
years. Before cardrooms and casinos, purses were funded exclusively through handle, and before 
simulcasting, all purses were funded through live handle.
 
Purses have received a significant boost with the introduction of cardrooms and slot 
machine casinos. At jai alai and greyhound facilities, 4 percent of cardroom gross receipts must be 
used to fund purses; the figure is 50 percent at horse race facilities.
 
Unlik
e other racino states, 
Florida s
tatutes do not mandate that a certain percentage of gross gaming revenue or a dollar 
amount from slot machines be used to fund purses and for breeding purposes. About the closest 
Florida comes is a requirement that a t
horoughbred or quarter horse operator have a contract with 
horsemen before a casino can open. The horsemen at Pompano and greyhound owners say they 
need a similar
-
type law. Without one, they say the boost that casino revenue was supposed to 
generate for pu
rses for greyhounds and harness will never be realized.

is much higher at 
thoroughbred
 
than it is at harness and greyhound tracks. The two
 
racino
 
thoroughbred racetracks, 
Gulfstream a
nd Calder
,
 
paid 14 percent and 12 percent, respectively, in FY 2012. The 

percent to 35 percent
, 
as the contract with the horsemen called for an increase if the tax 
rate was 
lowered. The GGR contribution nearly doubled. There was no such increase in GGR contribution 
at greyhound and harness racinos.
158
 
The two greyhound tracks and the one harness track put 
roughly 2 percent of GGR into purses in FY 2012.
159
 
Florida slot r
evenue accounts for much less on a percentage basis of total purse revenue 
than it does in other racino states. In Pennsylvania, for example, 
casino 
GGR accounted for 
anywhere from 75 percent to 91 percent of purses.

In Florida, our review of the FY 2012 
PMW 
annual report showed that the figure ranged from 22 percent to 48 percent.

Two sets of reports were used for this 
analysis. One involved 2012 audited financial statements for each pari

mutuel license holder. They 
included detailed breakdowns of expenses and revenues. They are not normally available to the 
public. PMW agreed to ma
ke them available to us. Pari

mutuel operators are required to supply 
those audited financial reports on a yearly basis. We also reviewed annual reports from 1990 to 
2012 that appear on the PMW 
website
. These reports provide details as to purses paid, paid
 
attendance, total handle and other items as well. The two reports cover different fiscal periods, 
and, as a result, the numbers sometimes do not match up.

: Tampa Bay Downs
 
What has hurt Tampa Bay Downs is that it is unable to supplement its purses with casino 
revenue as other thoroughbred tracks in Florida and throughout the country have done. The 
competition is fierce for quality horses as the nationwide breeding program ha
s collapsed, resulting 
in 23 percent 
fewer
 
race
-
ready horses being available to compete. Tampa Bay Downs has seen its 
field size shrink by 12 percent in the past three years. Horse owners are taking their horses to tracks 
that offer higher purses, and that
 
invariably means tracks that supplement their purses with casino 

 
said
.
173
 
Horsemen at thoroughbred racinos have much more levera
ge
 
with regard to labor contracts 
than do other pari
-
mutuel sectors due to the law that say
s a contract must be negotiated with 
horsemen before a casino can open. 
Mik
e Couch, director of gaming at G
ulfstream, 
said in an 
interview with Spectrum on May 16 that the law is unfair and results in Gulfstream paying out 
much more in GGR toward purses th
an the other sectors pay.

174
 
No other pari

mutuel facility in the state comes close to that figure. In fact, 
most pari

mutuel facilities lose money on t
heir pari
-
mutuel operations, and need cardroom and/or 
casino revenue to subsidize those losses. Couch said the reason Gulfstream is successful with its 
pari
-
mutuel operation is because it considers itself first to be a racetrack and then a casino.
 
The thor

track, Isle Casino and Racing at Pompano, accounted for 5 percent 
of 
total Florida handle in FY 2012.
 
The Pompano track must run at 
least 140 performances a year 
but it can seek a one

time
,
 
10 percent reduction from the 140
-
performance minimum. The harness 
track stopped charging an admission fee in 2002. In 2001, the last year it levied an admission fee, 
paid attendance was 9,908. In 1
990, it was 565,216.
176
 
 
Harness handle fell from $112.1 million in FY 1990 to $48.1 million in FY 2012, a decline 
of 57 percent while live handle fell from $14.1 million to $4.4 million, a decline of 69 percent. On 
a national level, total harness handle fro
m CY 2001 to CY 2010 fell from $866 million to $453 
million, a decline of 48 percent and live handle fell from $452 million to $162 million, a decline 
of 64 percent. (CY 2010 was the most recent year available.)
177
 
 
The harness track is not required to have 
a contract with horsemen as thoroughbred tracks 
are required to do before a casino can open. The percentage of GGR to purses is much less than it 
is at thoroughbred tracks. In FY 2012, $2.6 million of $121 million in GGR went toward purses at 
Pompano. Gulf
stream with a GGR of $54.5 million put $7.5 million of GGR into purses.

Joe Pennachio, president of the Florida Standardbred Breeders

resulted in Pompano getting its casino.

was open. The facility is in a state of disrepair. According to Pennachio, management will close 
the

. 
  
 
The purse figures for Pom

of PMW, on May 16, 2013, in 
which the director acknowledged that the PMW purse amounts were overstated by several million 
dollars. PMW will be amending its annual report as 
it relates to Pompano for FY 2009

Biegalski said in his email that PMW relies on figures provided to it by pari

that run a quarte
r
-
mile at speeds 
as high as 55 miles per hour. Quarter horse racing returned to Florida in November 2009 at Hialeah 
Park after an 18
-
year absence. 
Quarter horse racing accounted for less than 1 
percent of total 
Florida handle in FY 2012. Quarter horse racing had 76 performances in FY 2012. It generated 
a 
live handle of $1.7 million, total handle of $2.1 million and purses of $3.8 million. Almost all of 
the traditional quarter horse activity was a
t Hialeah, where the operator subsidized purses as part 
of its contract with horsemen.
 
 
Hialeah has already begun negotiations with the state to offer live thoroughbred racing
, in 
addition to the quarter horse racing
.

Obtaining the quarter horse permit ma

Steve Fisch, president of the Florida Quarter Horse Owners Association, said that Hialeah 
purses will total $140,000 a day or $5.6 million in FY 
2013, 47 percent higher than it was in FY 
2012, when Hialeah operated without a casino. 
Hialeah owner Brunetti explained in an interview 
with Spectrum on June 5, 2013, that live handle was so low the first three years that he had to pay 
almost the entire a
mount of purses himself from FY 2009 thru FY 2012. In FY 2012, Hialeah paid 
out purses of $3.8 million. During the three
-
year period ending June 30, 2012, Brunetti said he lost 
nearly $30 million as he had no cardroom or slot machine revenue to help him of
fset the loss
. 
 
Florida state law allows quarter horse racing to be imported
 
only
 
into Florida simulcast 
parlors while there is live racing at Hialeah. That is not an issue for the thoroughbreds since they 
race year
-
round. But it is a problem for the new quarter horse industry as the live meet is only 40 
days.

the Florida Quarter Horse Racing Association refused 
to endorse the project so it then embraced barrel racing.

Dunbar
 
said.
 
Fisch notes that barrel racing requires substantially fewer horses and personnel than 
traditional quarter horse racing as conducted at Hialeah Park. The cost of erecting a barrel race 
course is minimal when compar
ed with the several million dollars that would have to be invested 
to build a quarter horse track, he noted. Gretna offered purses of $202,000 in FY 2012; Hialeah 
offered purses of $3.8 million. Gretna had a live handle of $31,000; Hialeah, $1.6 million.
185
 
Another track, Hamilton Downs, has also received a license to operate barrel racing. 
 
Greyhound Racing
 
Greyhound racing 
accounted for 30 per
cent of total handle in FY 2012. 
Total handle for 
the 13 facilities that ran greyhound racing fell from $933.8 milli
on in FY 1990 to $265.4 million 
in FY 2012, a decline of 67 percent. Palm Beach Kennel Club had the highest handle at $36.3 
million; Melbourne Greyhound Park, the lowest at $162,000. Live handle (live handle and total 
handle were the same in 1990) fell eve
n more, from $933.8 million to $93 million, a decline of 90

available), total handle fell from $2 billion to $706 million, a decline of 65 percent and live handle 
fell from $829 million to $203 million, a decline of 76 percent. Performances fell from 4,242 to 
3,336, a decline of 21 percent; paid attendance fell fr
om 653,206 to 97,738, a decline of 85 
percent.
187
 
 
Florida greyhound performances (a racing card of at least eight races) fell from 3,853 to 
3,636, a decline of 6 percent. One of the reasons for the relatively small decline is because of the

of them was 1996.

with state law.

Track spokesman Isadore Havenick told us in an interview that his company does 
not want to eliminate racing but need

rule. He noted that the situation was quite different in 1996 when greyhound racing was much 
more popular than it is today. Running so many races and performances results in the track 
sustaining a l
oss of more than $2 million a year on its dog operations, he said, and forces it to offer 
lower purses, which adversely affects the amount of money wagered on simulcasting and the 
quality of dogs that race. Havenick said there is still a demand
 
for greyhou
nd racing in the Fort
 
Myers
-

 
Repealing the 90 percent rule
,
 

,

could result in the closure of five to six
 
greyhound tracks, according to operators we interviewed. Those facilities would still 
like to 
operate cardrooms, as they are profitable, but the
y cannot as 
current law states that a cardroom can 
only be operated at a licensed pari
-
mutuel facility that offers live racing. Top
-
tier tracks such
 
as 
Naples
-
Fort
 
Myers and the Palm Beach Kennel Cl
ub will benefit through higher simulcast revenue 
if other tracks were to close. 
 
It is clear that pari
-
mutuel operations at greyhound tracks are loss leaders as the tracks 
sustained a combined operating loss from wagering on greyhounds of $35 million. Only
 
three 
tracks made a profit. Greyhound track cardrooms offset the loss with an operating profit of $39 
million.

upling (removing the requirement for 
minimum performances) will help us in the short run as we would run fewer races which, in turn, 
will lower our operating costs. Our simulcast revenue will also increase
, 
but there just are not 
enough folks out there to 

PBKC would shut down the dog track if it could, Glenn said.
 
Jamie Shelton, CFO of Jacksonville Greyhound Racing, agrees with Glenn. He said that 
no matter what efforts are made to prop

just too many other things

Ja
cksonville has consolidated its operations. It has three greyhound permits, and runs all 
of them out of Orange Park. It shuttered its Jacksonville facility in March 2012, and, as the result 
of a declaratory statement from PMW, it was able to move its cardr
oom to a Jacksonville shopping 
center.
191
 
The track operator requested a ruling from PMW before it built its new facility in 
Jacksonville. In effect, PMW sanctioned a form of decoupling, allowing a pari
-
mutuel facility to 
open without having to operate a tra
ck oval and offer live racing. PMW based its decision on the 
fact that 
s


.
 
With the three 
permits, Orange Park operates year
-
round: 340 days and 417 performances 
in FY 2012. Shelton said the facility just about breaks even but he noted that it is just a matter of 
time before the losses on racing will become so large that Orange Park will have t
o close. Even 
slot machines w
ould not
 
help
,
 
as 
they would not compel 
people to bet on the dog races, he noted. 
Slot machines would prop up the business for a while but eventually the sport will die, he said.
 
Jack Cory, a lobbyist for greyhound owners, 
said
 
the sport would
 
no
t be dying if track 
operators would reinvest in their properties. He noted that some of them have let them deteriorate 
to the point where going to 
those tracks
 
is
 
unpleasant. He 
note
d
 
that the intent of the 90 percent 
rule was to preserve live racing by making sure that live racing had to be offered in exchange for 
the right to operate a cardroom or casino. 




 
As we have noted throughout this report, operators are looking for ways to reduce the costs 
of
 
operating pari
-
mutuel events. Melbourne Greyhound track proposed running two
-
dog races with 
a two
-
kennel roster under the same ownership for its 2013 meet. The American Greyhound 

a
n 
affront to the greyhound owners and kenn
el operators in 

competing in full fields (most preferably, eight entries per race), and to those fans who enjoy 
watching and wagering on such races.

192
 
In light 
of the opposition, Melbourne withdrew its 
petition for two
-
dog races.
 
G
rey2K USA, an organization calling for the end of dog racing on humane grounds, frames 
the issue this way: Should the 
state 

force a business to conduct one activity so that it may 
offer 
another
?

193
 
According to Grey2K, nearly two
-
thirds of the 1,199 licensed greyhound owners live 
out of state. As for humane issues, the organization claims that 8,000 greyhounds are kept in kennel

in cages 20 to 23 hours a day. Nine cases 
of severe neglect have been documented at Florida dog tracks and kennels since 2004.

Jai Alai
 
The object of j
ai
 
a
lai is to hurl the ball (pelota) against the front wall with the goal being 
that an opponent will be unable to return it. The game can involve doubles or singles. Games are 
7 to 9 points. It used to be that as ma
ny as eight different teams would play. A losing team would 
go to the end of the bench.
196
 
Florida is the only state that continues 
to offer jai alai, which 

-
mutuel handle in FY 2012.
 
Of all the pari
-
mutuel se
ctors, jai alai has sustained the steepest cuts in attendance and 
popularity. Since 1990, total handle has fallen 91 percent, live handle 96 percent, player awards 
63 percent and performances, 63 percent. In 1990, 3.9 million people paid to watch the sport
. In 
2012, total paid attendance was 9,068.
197
 
The six jai alai operators suffered an operating loss for FY 2012 of $25.6 million; $21.6 
million came from Ft. Pierce
-
Miami Jai Alai, whose auditor expressed concern whether the 
frontons could continue to stay 
in business. The 
slots
 
at Miami Jai Alai may improve its fiscal 
situation.
198
 
From pari
-
mutuel operations, the jai alai sector sustained an operating loss of $14 
million. Cardrooms were able to generate an operating profit of $1 milli
on. 
Miami
 
Jai Alai had t
he 
highest handle at $6.6 million in FY 2012; Hamilton Jai Alai, the lowest at $2.00.
199
 
The Miami fronton opened in 
1926
. 
Through the 
1980s, 
business 
was brisk
. 
T
he fronton 
was renovated and 
seating expanded from 
7,000 to well over 13,000. 
But things 
changed as new 
forms of gambling became legal in 1
960s and 1970s
.
200
 
 
Like other pari
-
mutuel sectors, jai alai is required to offer a minimum number of 
performances to keep its cardroom open. And the number depends on when the cardroom opened.

As noted in ot
her pari
-
mutuel sectors,
 
the 90 percent rule requires that live performances be equal 
to at least 90 percent of what was conducted the year before the cardroom opened. Performances 
in FY 2012 ranged from a high of 214 at Dania to 24 at Hamilton. A performa
nce consists of eight 
games.
 
Last year, Ocala stretched the letter of the law when it 
hired two locals
 
who played each 
other over and over to comply with the minimum
-
performance law. The operation drew protests 
from jai alai players in South Florida who pi
cketed the fronton. They argued that having the same 
two players play was a gimmick to comply with the law. General Manager Brian Matthews told 
us in an interview on May 21 that he had no choice but to run jai alai the way he did because it 
loses so much m

audited report submitted to the state for FY 2012, Ocala lost $453,000 on jai alai. Part of that 
included a $22,000 tax because Matthews elected to run only 41 performances instead
 
of the 100 

this was just jai alai, we would have been closed long ago
. 
 
Glenn Richards operates Hamilton Jai Alai and Poker. He operates pretty much the 
same 
way as Ocala, and acknowledged to us in an interview on May 8, 2013
,
 
that he is not happy about 

 

door. 
We 

yone is betting on it any more either.
 
The 
total handle in FY 2012: two dollars
.
201
 
Richards relies on a four
-
person 
jai alai
 
roster. One is a father and his son, who both at one 
time played professionally at South Florida frontons. Richards must hold 100 pe
rformances over 
a 
fiscal
 
year to retain his cardroom license, which opened in 2004. He is hopeful he can stay open 
until next year when the law will allow him to reduce his performances to 40. 
 
 
For now, his four players play several times a day over a one
-
week period from March to 
June to meet the 100
-
performance requirement

Critical Issues to Address
 
The thoroughbred sector is clearly the healthiest of the sectors but it too has sustained steep 

pari
-
mutuel facilities open is cardroom 
and slot revenue but eventually, if the downward trend continues, it is likely that even those 
revenues will not be enough to keep some greyhound tracks and frontons open. Many operators 
acknowledged to us that the p
rospect of possibly operating 
slot machines
 
was enough for them to 
continue to stay in business and sustain significant losses. In FY 2012, the pari
-
mutuel operations 
at the greyhound tracks sustained operating losses of $35 million, 
jai alai
, $14 million 
and harness, 
$2.4 million. Only the thoroughbred tracks were able to realize an operating profit, $10.6 million, 
from their pari
-
mutuel operations.

88
 
 
One area that 

is in 
need
 
of
 
review is the 
law requiring a 
minimum
 
number of 
pe
rformance
s. 
When the law was adopted in 1996, the intent was to assist 
pari
-
mutuels by providing a funding st
r
eam for purses. But operators say times have changed, and 

ators 
across the country have reduced racing dates, which, in turn, lets them increase average purses and 
lower operating costs. In Florida, a number of operators are forced to run well over 300 
performances a year. 
 
At the same time, horsemen and dog owne
rs stress that some operators have done all they 
can to destroy their pari
-
mutuel operations in an effort to convince the Legislature to adopt 

held. 
 
Pennsylvania rel
ies on a racing advocate to ensure that its racino operators do not ignore 
racing interests. Each year, 
t
he Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board
 
compiles an annual 
benchmark report to measure the 
impact that slot machine
 
revenues hav
e had 
on the 
ho
rse racing 
industry
. Florida
 
has no such review mechanism.
 
Purses a
t the harness track
, even with a 
casino, 
have actually dec
lined, and horsemen say that casino
 
operations overshadow the track. The track 
is considering shutting down the grandstand, which would make it the only track in the country 
where patrons watch the finish of a race 
one
-
sixteenth 
of a mile away from the finish line.
 
With respect to casinos, 
as we noted in this report, the thoroughbred and quarter horse 
sectors are treated differently
 
when it comes to pari
-
mutuel requirements. This is true even within 
the horse racing sector itself. Thoroughbred and quarter horse operators, for example, must h
ave a 
contract in place 
with horsemen 
before they can open a casino. There is no such requirement for 
harness
 
or
 
the other pari
-
mutuel sectors
. 
Almost all racino states require that a certain amount of 
gross gaming revenue 
be set aside to enhance purses. T
here is no such requirement in Florida
. 
 
Another contentious issue that
 
may
 
come before
 
the Legislature 
is how to 
define a race or 
a game. Jai alai and dog track operators have argued that the current law is vague enough that it 
allows them to run just two
 
dogs in a race or have just two jai alai players play over and over. 
There is the barrel
-
racing issue that has drawn national attention. An administrative law judge 
recently ruled that PMW had no right to issue a barrel
-
racing permit for quarter horse rac
ing.

Cardrooms
 
a.
 
Nationally
 
Five states
 
including Florida
 
allow cardrooms 
that are not inside a 
casino.
 
Typically, 
cardroom games are res
tricted to poker and poker varia
nts, although
 
Washington began allowing 
cardrooms in 1997 to offer blackjack.
 
It is dif
ficult to compare cardroom performance in Florida with
 
card
rooms 
in other states 
because
 
Florida is the only state that restricts its cardrooms to pari
-
mutuel facilities that, for the 
most 
part, are racing
-
only operations
. 
Other states such as Washington a
nd California allow their 
cardrooms in standalone facilities
. Montana does not provide any data. Minnesota has only one 
cardroom.
203
 
Because of the differences from state
-
to
-
state in cardroom operations, the American 
Gaming Association stopped collecting revenue numbers for cardrooms 
effective with its 
2009
 
annual 
State of the States 
report.
 
W
e tracked performance data for 
California
, 
as its cardroom business model is the closest 

.
204
 
Despite the drop
-
off, its gross receipts increased from $563 million to $794 million, an increase of 
46 percent. During
 

million, a nearly 17
-
fold increase. 
 
b.
 
Florida
 
The first Florida cardrooms, which are restricted to poker
 
and dominoes
, opened on January 
1, 1997. 
While dominoes is a permitted game
, most facilities do not offer it. Palm Beach Kennel 
Club said it stopped offering it after months went by and no one played the game. 
By the end of 
the 
first 
fiscal year, nine cardrooms were operating.
205
 
Gross receipts, or the amount received by 
the cardro
om from players, totaled $2.2 million that first year. At that time, the winnings of any 
player in a single round, hand or game could not exceed $10. P
layers at a five
-
handed seven
-
card 
stud table would simply put in $2 each and all betting and raising wou
ld cease. The dealer simply 
dealt the rest of the hand face up
. A cardroom could only operate two hours prior to post time and 
up to two hours after the last pari
-
mutuel event. The state established a 10 percent tax on gross 
receipts, a rate that continues
 
to this day. 
Additionally, each operator must pay cardroom table fees 
annually in the amount of $1,000 for each table to be operated.

Poker in Florida began to increase in popularity in 2003
,
 
when the Legislature amended 
the law to enable the poker 
pot 
t
o exceed 
$10, but players could 
still 
not bet more than $2 with any 
given action.
 
Up until then, poker gross receipts had not increased much at all but they soared from 
$2.8 million in 2003 to $18.5 million in FY 2004. With more venues added, the figure co
ntinued 
to rise by double
-
digit percentages through 2009 when it totaled $102 million. In FY 2012, it 
reached $131.5 million. The change that made Florida a major poker playing state was the removal 
of all betting limits as of July 1, 2010. Today, there ar
e 2
4
 
cardrooms. In 2003, there were only 10. 
Other cardroom rule changes that increased the profitability of cardrooms included a provision 
that also took effect July 1, 2010, that increased their hours of operation to 18 hours during the 
week and 24 hours
 
on weekends.
207
 
The cardroom law was created to boost operations at pari
-
mutuel facilities. They had to be 
at a track or jai alai fronton. At jai alai and greyhound facilities, 4 percent of cardroom gross 
receipts are used to fund purses and player awards; the figure is 5
0 percent at horse race facilities. 
 
But with 
opening of B
estbet in Jacksonville in February 2012, Florida had its first off
-
track 
betting parlor. 
PMW made it possible for that to happen when it issued a declaratory statement to 
allow pari
-
mutuel businesse
s to operate
 
a separate cardroom and simulcast 
parlor if
 
the license 
holder closed an existing facility and opened a poker room in the same county and within 30 miles 
of the old one.
208
 
Jacksonville Greyhound Racing Inc. closed its Jacksonville track in 2009
 
but 
retained its license and transferred its racing dates to nearby Orange Park, which it also owns. 
Jacksonville 
was then able to transfer its cardroom license to the off
-
site location in Jacksonville, 
and establish the biggest cardroom in the state of F
lorida
, without having to build a track oval
. 
Geographical constraints make it difficult for other such license transfers to occur.
209
 
But we note 
that Palm
 
Beach Kennel Club acquired a
n inactive
 
jai alai permit and then converted it into a 
greyhound permit. At issue is whether it can now operate a cardroom from a remote location as 
Jacksonville Racing has done.
210
 
The matter is currently before the courts. 
 
Palm Beach Kennel Club had the highest ca
rdroom receipts in FY 2012 at $11.4 million; 
Hamilton Jai Alai and Poker the lowest at $596,000.
211
 
Palm Beach Kennel Club Manager Noah 
Carbone, in 
a 
May 16, 2013,
 
interview
 
said the rule changes have made Florida one of the top 
poker venues in the country. 
He said before the rule changes, professional players from Florida

would travel to Atlantic City and Nevada to play poker. Now, they stay here, he 
sai
d. 
Further, 
many tourists are also playing now that the table limits have been removed.
 
Carbone said he wo
uld like to see the state remove the requirement that cash cannot be 
placed on a poker table. The law currently requires that players use only chips. He believes that 
relaxing the cash rule will increase profits for the cardrooms.
 
The cardrooms have become
 
so 
profitable that they have enticed new pari
-
mutuel operations to open and have resulted in still 
others continuing to remain open even though their pari
-
mutuel activity generate substantial losses, 
as we have noted throughout this report.
 
For example, t
he greyhound sector cardrooms generated an operating profit in FY 2012 of 
$38.8 million while their pari
-
mutuel activities had an operating loss of $35 million. Daytona 
Beach Kennel Club had the highest cardroom operating profit of $6.4 million. All but on
e of the 
greyhound tracks had cardroom operating profits.
212
 
The racing sector cardrooms also generated 
an operating profit of $2.6 million.
213
 
Some operators, such as Jamie Shelton, the CFO of Jacksonville Greyhound Racing, noted 
though that cardroom revenues
 
have begun to level off across the state. In an interview with 
Spectrum on May 30, 2013, Shelton said that it is unrealistic to expect cardroom revenue to 
continue to subsidize pari
-
mutuel operations. At some point, he noted that there will come a point 
w
here the cardroom profits cannot cover the pari
-

said. 
 
FY 2013 data show that cardroom revenue has begun to 
decline
 
at many facilities. We 
compared the 10
-
month period ending April 30 with the previous year:
 
Calder was off by 17 
percent, Tampa Bay Downs, 14 percent and Pensacola Greyhound track, 10 percent. Thirteen of 
the 24 cardrooms associated with live racing sustained declines.

Should these downward trends 
continue, the ramifications for the pari

mutuel
 
operations could be ominous.

for any other purpose.
 
For more detail on 
the regulatory aspects of bingo

Bingo is not regulated by the Stat
e of Florida. However, municipalities and/or counties that 
permit bingo have their own ordinances that govern its operation. Most municipalities require 
a 
business tax license, or occupational license, to conduct bingo. 
The licenses are issued annually 
and
 
require copies of IRS financial statements.
 
Spectrum interviewed charitable bingo owners/operators, 
a bingo 
industry 
publisher 
as 
well as bingo equipment distributor executives in an effort to assess the
 
size and
 
state of charitable 
bingo in Florida.
 
In F
lorida, charitable bingo is conducted by charitable organizations on the premises of the 
qualified organization (such as a

provides for a

others lease the premises to multiple qualified organizations. For example, Bingo Magic of Lake 
Wor
th, in 
Greenacres,
 

Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, and Bingo at Four Corners, in Pompano 
Beach, has lease agreements with 20 qualified charities with each charitable
 
organization arranging 
to conduct a bingo session at the bingo hall on a scheduled day or night. 
 
All

Since bingo is not regulated by the State, the statewide total 
net proceeds from bingo games 
that is donated to charity is not quantifi
able. Several bingo publications and/or websites list the 
available bingo games throughout the state; however, most of the published lists we researched 
were not inclusive or current. Spectrum estimates that there are 
currently 
between 300 to 
400 bingo 
act
ive operations 
in Florida.
 
Based on our interviews with bingo owner/operators as well as others associated with 
charitable bingo in Florida, it is apparent that statewide participation in charitable bingo is trending 
significantly downward. The number of a
vailable bingo locations is dwindling and participation is 
rapidly decreasing. For example, daily attendance
 
at 
Bingo at Four Corners
 
is down from a

highpoint of over 400 bingo players per day in the 1990s to an average of approximately 100 
players per day
 
currently. Historically, the amount of revenues received by charities from this 
bi
ngo hall has gone from $30,000 to
 
$50,000 per month in 1995 to approximately $10,000 a month 
currently.
 
In Palm Beach County, t
he number of bingo halls in
 
has decreased from
 
six to two since 
over the past decade. 
Moreover, the general increase in rent and fixed operating expenses paid by 
bingo hall operators for their premises continues to rise and has 
had 
a negative effect on net 
proceeds.
 
Based on our research, the downward
 
trend in bingo in Florida is attributable to 
several
 
factors including: 
 

 
Overall downturn in the national economy
 

 
Competition from other forms of gaming including casinos, racinos and lottery 
 

 
Competition from

, as currently sanctioned,
 
is increasingly less competitive.
 
As 
each new form of gam
bling has been introduced 

 
legal and otherwise 

 
bingo revenues continue 
to decline. Those associated with bingo in Florida said the downward trend in bingo par
ticipation 
is multifaceted but pointed to the fact that bingo is unable to compete with the costly marketing 
efforts and giveaways of 
Indian
 
casinos, pari

impact is most pronounced.
 
B
ingo distributors we interviewed 
agreed with the observation that
 
an overall downward 
trend due to competition from various other forms o
f gaming and the outdated $250 statutory limit 
on jackpot prizes. They 
pointed to
 
Miami
-
Dade and Broward counties as prime examples of where 
competition from the opening of racinos has substantially adversely affected bingo participation. 
For example, the 
number of bingo locations in Broward County has shrunk from eight to one since 
racinos have opened.

In Florida, the downward tren
d in net bingo proceeds directly impacts the charitable 
organizations intended to benefit from this activity. However, those associated with bingo 
interviewed by Spectrum all emphasized that bingo and expanded gaming can coexist if bingo is 
allowed to offe
r the right jackpot prizes and game content. Most agree that bingo, unlike other 


such as casinos or pari

gaming.
 
Indeed, numerous published reports, including a recent 
Wall Street Journal
 
article,
215
 
point 
to a renewal of bingo in the United States. Progressive approaches that include new technological 
advances, coupling bingo wit
h other entertainment amenities, linked jackpots and higher prize 
offerings have resulted in more bingo participation by younger players and college students. Some 
of these innovative practices range from bingo being offered in bowling alleys and in venues
 
that 

-


population in South Texas, Arizona and California. Also n
oteworthy is a new approach in Illinois, 
where legislation has been introduced to allow bingo on hand
-
held devices in bars and restaurants.
 
The bingo equipment distributors we interviewed indicated that bingo participation across 
North America has been tre
nding downward but provided several particular examples of upward 
trends in states where recent progressive statutory reforms have been implemented. For example, 
in Virginia and Minnesota, electronic pull
-
tab bingo and other newer game offerings have resul
ted 
in an increase in participation rates. Other progressive reforms, such as in Ontario, Canada, where 
new regulations provide for splitting proceeds between the bingo owner/operators and charities 
has resulted in significant upward trends in overall proc
eeds.
 
In several other states, the proliferation of Internet
/sweepstakes
 
cafes has adversely 
affected traditional bingo participation. Tim Stewart, President and CEO of Bingo King, a 
worldwide bingo equipment distributor, estim
ates that gross sales in stat
es
 
such as Ohio and 
California
 
where Internet cafes have spread have 
declined more
 
than
 
20 percent.
 
In Florida, the recent enactment of legislation that bans 
Internet
 
cafes and adult arcade
 
has 
adversely affected 
some 
bingo operators in the state who also had adult arcade games on their 
premises. The bingo halls we visited that previously had operational adult arcade games took the 
games out of play in order to comply with the new law. 
 
The bingo operators with arcade g
ames had previously offered prizes that were essentially 
free credits for regular bingo play. Many traditional bingo players would arrive well before the 
scheduled start of regular bingo and play the arcade games hoping to win free credits (such as

Gale Fontaine, President of the Florida Arcade and Bingo Association, 
said her trade group

about 215 members 
and has been losing bingo members steadily over the past dec

With all the recent developments regarding arcade games, she said the organization has over 50 
new arcade members that joined this

prominent with many bingo hall owners/operators also in th

Lottery
 
a.
 
Nationally
 
The first modern state lottery began in New Hampshire in 1964.
217
 
A large number of states 
began introducing lotteries in the 1980s, and currently, the only states without a lottery
 
are Alaska, 
Alabama, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, Utah, and Wyomin
g (although Wyoming in March 2013 
enacted lottery 
legislation)
.
 
By 2012, the Florida Lottery ranked third in the nation, behind New 
York and Massachusetts, in total sales revenue (FY 2011).
218
 
Each of these states had net receipts 
(total sales minus prizes paid and administrative costs
) of over $1 billion.
219
 
The following chart
 
shows the trend in US lottery sales between 1990 and 2010, in nominal dollars. Gross sales 
(handle) represents total lottery sales for all states; net sales represents gross sales minus prizes 
paid out and administrative costs, or the net amount of revenu
e for the states. As the 
chart
 
shows, 
the net revenue to states has increased modestly over this period.

For fiscal years.
 
As 
shown in the 
chart
, lotteries raised almost $18
 
billion for state governments in 2010. 

That is, even though lotteries represent a relatively high tax rate on s
pending, citizens can easily 
avoid the tax simply by not purchasing lottery tickets.
 
Lotteries are, by far, the most profitable form of legalized gambling. For each $1 ticket 
sold, the state keeps approximately 50
 
cents
 

220
 
Roughly 10
 
to 20 
cents is directed 
to
 
administrative costs, and the remainder is paid out in prizes. Based on the data in the 
chart
 
above 
the proportion of net revenue to states was 
roughly 40 percent
 
in 2010 (over $5
0
 
bil
lion in gross 
sales and about $18
 
billion in net revenue).
 

 
the lottery 

 
like other forms of 
gambling 

 
has its 
critics. A long
-
running criticism of lotteries is that the revenues tend to come 
disproportionately from lower
-
income 

221
 
In 
addition, studies have found that the benefits from lottery funded educational initiatives tend to 
accrue to higher

income individuals.

essivity of the lottery. 

223
 
due to 
their unfavorable odds, lottery play remains the most broadly popular and regionally widespread 
gambling activity both nationally, where 53 percent report play
ing the lottery within the past 
year,
224
 
and within Florida, where 60 percent of residents report having played the lottery at least 
once in their lifetimes and 44 percent say they have played within the past year.
225
 
A
 
2005 report from 
the Brookings Instituti
on notes the following:
 
A number of studies have investigated the demographic predictors of lottery gambling and 
have tended to find that, on average, state lottery products are disproportionately consumed 

al trends. First, lottery gambling extends 
across races, sexes, and income and education groups. Second, black respondents spend 
nearly twice as much on lottery tickets as do white or Hispanic respondents. 
 
The average reported expenditure among blacks is 
$200 per year, $476 among those who 
played the lottery last year. Black men have the highest average expenditures. Third, 
average annual lottery spending in dollar amounts is roughly equal across the lowest, 
middle, and highest income groups. This implies 
that on average, low
-
income households 
spend a larger percentage of their wealth on lottery tickets than other households. 
Interestingly, the regressivity of the state lottery appears to vary across lottery products. 
 
Low
-
income lottery players are more li
kely than other lottery players to bet on instant 
games. Among NORC survey respondents who report playing the lottery, 38 percent of 
those in the lowest
-
income third report that they purchased an instant ticket the last time 
they played the lottery, compar
ed to 27 and 19 percent of players in the middle and highest
-
income third. Higher
-
income players are more likely to have purchased a ticket on a jackpot 
lotto game 
-
 
56 percent of those in the highest
-
income third, 49 percent in the middle group, 
and 39 pe
rcent in the lowest
-
income third. 
 
The NORC survey also asks respondents about their favorite state lottery game. Instant 
games are the most common reported favorite among those in the lowest
-
income third, 
while jackpot lotto games are by far the most comm
on stated favorite among those in the 
higher income categories.
226
 
Spectrum has asked the Florida Lottery for Z
IP
 
Code and other information related to 
examining both the proportion of lottery purchases in poor neighborhoods, as well as the 
proportion of tic
kets sold to non
-
Florida residents. As of this writing, Spectrum has not received a 
response.

Another 
c
riticism of lotteries is that, despite the fact that they are often earmarked for 
programs such as education, it is not clear that the overall level of f
unding for such programs 
actually increases. For example, politicians could reduce other types of education funding as 
lottery contributions to education increase. Thus, the lottery may result in a net increase or decrease 
to educational funding in a state

This finding reflects the general differences in opinion that 
exist across the states.
 
Overall, state lotteri
es are the most common forms of legal gambling in the United States. 
In aggregate, lotteries generate far more income for states than any other form of gambling. 
Lotteries also provide employment and economic benefits, both from direct employment of 
approx
imately 440 employees

locations

licensed establishments. Electronic 

term for slot machines, video lottery terminals, video poker machines, electronic bingo game, or 
any other slot
-
like gambling machine. At year end 2012, EGDs operated in 12,042 locations in the 
seven states.
233
 
In the five
 
states where full
-
year data were reported for fiscal year 2012, the retail 
EGDs generated $2.3 billion in gross gaming revenue.
 
In Illinois, Louisiana, Montana and Nevada, the retail gaming programs are regulated by 
their respective gambling control board
s/agencies. In Oregon, South Dakota and West Virginia, 
the 
respective state l
ottery operates the retail gaming programs. The states use a variety of taxes, 
revenue sharing, franchise fees and/or device fees to collect revenue from the EGDs. The host 
establ
ishments receive a share of the revenue based on a formula established by the state.
 
Retail gaming programs are seen as successful from a revenue standpoint because of their 
wide geographic distribution and convenience. However, the
y are controversial beca
use the
 
EGDs 
may be too convenient for those with, or 
susceptible
 
to, gambling problems and because they may 
be in plain view of children. 
 
Following are the revenue results 

 
in net sales (i.e., gaming revenue) 

 
for the three retail 
gaming programs opera

As noted, four states authorize retail gaming that is independent of the lottery. Nevada d

yet to report a full year of results. The following chart provides the retail gaming revenue for

Other states have considered retail gaming programs over the years, and
 
Spectrum believes 
that states will continue to consider implementing retail gaming as other forms of gambling within 
their borders become saturated or difficult to legalize.
 
Key issues in considering the authorization of retail gaming include:
 

 
Whether the
 
easy accessibility could exacerbate problem gambling.
 

 
Whether the devices would be in sight of minors who patronize a host establishment.
 

 
Whether the EGDs would cannibalize existing casino or lottery play.
 

 
The types of EGDs that would be allowed.
 

 
The tax 
scheme/distribution of revenue.
 

 
Which state agency would be responsible for directing and/or regulating the program.

Sports Betting
 
The 1992

sports betting while grandfathering the four states that already had authorized it in some form. The 
four states are Delaware, Montana, Nevada and Oregon.
 
Only Nevada offers traditional spo
rts betting; i.e., the opportunity to wager on a single
-
event outcome, covering both professional and amateur sports, based on odds posted by the casino. 

lin
e based on wagering patterns and/or event information, with the goal of attracting the same 
amount wagered on both sides of the bet. The casino makes its money by effectively charging a 
commission on the bets, although it can incur a significant win or los
s if a lopsided amount is 
wagered on the winning or losing team. 
 
The Nevada Gaming Control Board regulates sports betting, as it does all casino games in 
the state.
 
Over the last 10 years, the Nevada casino industry has retained between 4 percent and 8 
pe
rcent of
 
sports betting
 
wagers as net gaming revenue. Nevada casino operators generally 

betting attracts many guests who otherwise might not visit the prope
rty 

 
and who spend on food, 
beverage, lodging and other amenities. Further, sports bettors often are accompanied by a non
-
sports
-
betting partner who will play other casino games.

Over the last 10 years, Nevada sports betting revenue has accounted for betw

resulting in net gaming revenue of $4.6 million. Of the net gaming reven

generated in the three racetrack casinos and 14 percent in the 31 retail locations. The following

unregulated bingo wagering can compete with charitable and regulated bingo operations elsewhere 
in the state. Unregulated gambling activitie
s of more immediate concern include playing casino 
style games outside the casinos, sports betting through bookies, and numbers games offered 
outside the Florida Lottery.

questions regarding illegal or unregulated activities such as gambling are less likely to be openly

/
sweepstakes parlors constitute a shadow gambling category which is now receiving 
increased attention across the country and has been banned in many states. Advocates contend that 
this is legal activity because players simply purchase Internet access time b
locks and are not 
wagering money on the prospect of receiving a greater reward, 
which is 
the traditional definition 
of gambling. Critics argue that there is little difference between the electronic gambling devices 
employed and video slot machines
,
 
and tho
se players are incented by the opportunity to win prizes 
with monetary value. In 2011 
Businessweek 
estimated that there could be as many as 5,000 Internet 
cafes operating nationwide generating $10 
billion 
to $15 billion dollars in revenue.
247
 
On April 10, 20
13, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed into law HB 155, which effectively 
proscribed sweepstakes gambling.
248
 
This action followed the well
-
publicized Allied Veterans of 
the World prosecution which resulted in the arrest of 57 people in racketeering indictme
nts for 
illegal gambling

and eventually 
led to the resignation of former Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll

251
 
This legislation effectively banned 

gambling and closing l
oopholes which have existed in Florida for decades and had allowed the 
earlier growth of unregulated wagering. Among other things HB 155 updates the definition of both 

amusement games or machine
s

operate
 

by means of the insertion of a coin

 
not swipe cards, and that, in order to be 

chance.
252
 
Specifically, the new legislation stipulates that 
legal 
machines cannot be "casino

style 
games in which the outcome is determined by factors unpredictable by the player or games in 
which the player may not control the outcome of the game through skill."

has been criticized both for taking advantage of seniors and for teaching minors and even children 
to gamble. Most adult arcades offer video gaming machines very much like the video device
s 
found in Internet cafes but instead of buying time online players can win small prizes and gift 
cards. Adult arcades were specifically prohibited from dispensing gift cards as prizes in the recent 
legislation which also limits top prize values to no more
 
than 75 cents.
254
 
 
Unsurprisingly, Internet café
s

restaurants have fought the legislation.
255
 
Internet café
s alone have been estimated to employ as 
many as 14,000 people who will now be unemployed.
256
 
The Florid
a Arcade & Bingo Association 
has appealed in Broward County, so far unsuccessfully, the inclusion of arcades in the HB 155

chines, sometimes using swipe cards. Companies such as Dave 

 
which feature arcade

258
 
Internet café operators have previously sought injunctions to prevent local government 
bans prior to the enactment of HB 155, particularly the unsuccessful fight against the ban in 
Broward County. More recently, two arcade operator
s in Broward County, 
Boardwalk Brothers
,
 
Inc.
 
and Play It Again Fla
.
 
LLC
, filed for an injunction to HB 155, claiming that the law is 

arbitrary, irrational, not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental purpose, and void for 
vagueness

Michael Satz, state attorney for 
Florida's 17th Judicial Circuit as defendant
, saw t
he Seminole Tribe of Florida
 
intervene as a 
defendant
 
before 
U.S. District Judge James 
I. 
Cohn refused to grant the

unction against the law.
259
 
Additional legal action is expected to be filed in Tallahassee on behalf 
of Internet café owners, gaming machine manufacturers, and software companies, according to 
persons involved in the industry.

In additio
n, grass roots seniors groups, such as Seniors 4 
Justice, are organizing in support of their local pastime, as well as legal teams from commercial 
restaurants with amusement arcades.
261
  
 
Amusement arcade slots have long been a feature of many East Coast bea
ch resorts and 
can easily be found in states which already have legalized casino 
gambling,
 
such as 
New Jersey
,
 
as well as those which currently have not, such as New Hampshire.
262
 
One primary issue 
affecting
 
whether these types of establishments catering to 
children remain open in Florida is whether they

The bill 
cl
arified the illegality of
 

maquinitas

 
gray market video gaming machines similar 
to arcade slots but also housed in gas stations, convenience stores, restaurants, cafeterias, and bars 
throughout the state. The new 
law caused a reversal of Miami M
ayor 
Tomá
s Regalado

policy initiative to regulate 
the maquinitas through municipal licensing and permit fees.
263
 
Apparently
,
 

adopting an ordinance more than two years ago requi
ring each establishment to register for a $500 
permit fee, not a single maquinita operator has applied for
 
the license.
264
 
The passage of HB
 
1
55 
has emboldened local law enforcement authoriti
es to take action against small
-
scale 
maquinita 
operations
,
 
which are numerous in Florida. While no one knows exactly how many actually exist 
and what revenue they produce, Miami Police Chief Manuel Orosa estimates that there are more 
than 1,000 maquinitas active in his city
 
alone, and each is
 
non
-
compliant with t
he city ordinance.
265
 
On June 4, 2013, 
the US District Judge James I. Cohn for the Southern District of Florida
 
denied a motion by Broward County adult arcades Boardwalk Brothers Inc. and Play It Again FLA 
LLC for an injunction against HB 155. The arcade own
ers argued that the law was 
unconstitutionally vague and violated
 
their First Amendment right of association.
 
Among Judge 

s
 
was that because gambling is a vice activity and can be banned altogether,

Like 
all privately run numbers games in the

, bolita gambling has been sidelined by the 
evolution of state sponsored lotter
y operations over the past 40
 
years. However, the prospect of 
superior relative odds, zero taxes, and cohesive immigrant community traditions have preserved 
bolita gambling
, which still competes with the regulated Florida Lottery, and the game remains 
popular today across the straits in Havana. 
 
Other forms of illicit and unregulated gambling in Florida include 
electronic bingo
, cock 
fighting and dog fighting, betting on spo
rting events, and Internet gambling. Pitting animals 
against each other and wagering upon the outcome is an ancient human activity 
that
 
is now so 
unacceptable to mainstream society that the practice, while still occurring frequently, is deeply 
underground 
and receives little public attention exce
pt for law

Conclusion
 
Gambling 
has
 
evolved to become a major US industry
, largely because it is popular and 
profitable 

 
both for operators and for the states that tax 
and regulate 
it
. All but two states (Hawaii 
and Utah) have some form of legalized gambling, although the size, scope, types, tax rates, 
and 
regulatory schemes
 
vary by state. For reasons discussed in following chapters, the combination of 
consumer acceptance
, technologica
l advances (such as the Internet)
 
and government desire for 
revenue will continue to cause further expansion.
 
We return to the observation put forth by John 

 
(gambling)
 

 
 
Expansion comes at a cost, both internally to the industry and externally to society. 
Expansion runs the risk of cannibalizing
 
certain types of gambling 

 
notably the pari
-
mutuel 
industry, which has long been in decline both nationally and in Florida
 

 
and
 
i
t will sharpen the 
debate about how much is too much. Importantly, expansion will further place a focus on assessing 
the societal and personal costs associated with gambling; we discuss this in general terms in 
Chapter II (
G
)
 
below.

The New US Frontier: 
Internet Gambling
 
1.
 
Nationally
 
Internet gambling has become a reality in the 
United States
 
only within the past year. On 
December 23, 2011, 
the Department of Justice issued
 
an opinion in response to inquiries from the 
Illinois and New York 
l
otteries reversin
g its long
-
held position and declaring that the 1961 Wire 
Act applies only to sports betting. This reversal opened the door to state by state legislation to 
regulate Internet gambling and online lottery sales.
 
Since the beginning of 2012 three states have 
passed such enabling legislation and each 
one follows a different model. Delaware was the first state to pass enabling laws and will roll out 
Internet wagering through a platform controlled and maintained by the Delaware Lottery. The 

 
racetrack casinos will offer branded websites offering most casino games and 
the lottery will offer Internet lotto sales. Nevada is the first state to actually regulate gambling 
operations via the Internet on April 30, 2013, as Station Casinos opened onli
ne operations through 
its partner, Ultimate Poker. As of May 14, 2013
,
 
UltimatePoker.com had 
surpassed 1 million
 
hand
s
 
of online poker.
269
 
New Jersey quickly followed Nevada into legalized Internet gambling, with 
Governor 
Chris 
Christie signing legislation o
nly five days after Governor 
Brian 
Sandoval
 
did
.
 
At this time, state
-
legalized Internet wagering is available only to residents or vis
itors 
currently located within a
 

-
location software. Interstate 
compacting is expected 
to follow suit similar to US lotteries constructing interstate compacts for 
multi
-
state lottery games
 
(such as Powerball and Mega Millions)
. A summary of US legal Internet 
gambling jurisdictions is found in the following table. 
At least 
10 state
s
 
are considering enabling 
legislation in a variety of forms, including California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York, Illinois 
and Iowa

the domestic economy where the Internet and mobile connectivity ha
ve
 
notably not been major 
factor
s
 
is in the field of gambling. Both commercial and tribal casinos in the 
United States
, as well 
as domestic lotteries find themselves in the same situation demographically. Their core player base 
is aging and not being fully re
placed by a younger generation. In casinos this is particularly true 
of slot machine patrons. For lotteries it is most prevalent among weekly instant ticket customers. 


that 80 percent of revenue often is derived from 20 percent of the customer base. For both of these 
gambling industries, the prevalent demographic of the Internet user is under
-
represented in their 
own player base, thus the Internet and mobile 
channels constitute an opportunity for engaging 
future customers. Also, with Internet distribution channels, the breadth and frequency of play will 
often increase, thereby spreading the generation of revenue across a broader spectrum of the player 
base.
 
A 
strong majority of Americans use the Internet regularly. According to the Pew Research 
Cent
er, as of December
 
2012, 81 percent of US residents use the Internet and 65 percent have 
broadband access.
270
 
Regular and frequent Internet users demonstrate the following demographic 
traits: they are usually younger, better educated, more affluent, more likely to be working full time, 
and more likely to be earning more income than the population as a whole. Freq
uency of Internet 
usage tends to be consistently higher among younger demographic ranges. A nationwide Gallup 
Poll conducted in December 2008 found that Americans below the age of 50 spend the most time 
online: 62 percent of those under 30 spend more than 
one hour online per day, as do 54 percent of 
those people 30 or older but under the age of 50.
271
 
A more recent Pew Post Election survey 
confirmed these demographic statistics and indicated that Internet usage is broadening among 
gender and racial demographi
cs while remaining upscale in relation to income and educational 
demographics.

The proportion of people who play for money on a social gaming site is fractional, usually 
in the low single digits, but multiplied by the total number of players on the site, the 
revenue 
quickly adds up. Monetized social gaming is estimated to have produced $1.6 billion in revenue 
globally with $660 million being generated in North America.

While leveraging the Internet can deliver a broader audience to commercial gambling 
operati

for problem gambling
 
issues.
 
Multiple studies show a potentially higher rate of problem gambling 
incidence for Internet gambling compared to land

based gambling, whil
e multiple competing 

Council on Compulsive Gambling survey conducted in 2011 documented problem gambling 

.1 percent for lifetime occurrence and 1.2 
percent for past
-
year occurrence.
278
 
These rates are generally consistent with the prevalence of 
problem gambling within land based gambling, benchmarked at 2.3 percent in 2008 according to 
the American Gaming Assoc
iation,
279
 
but should be carefully monitored if Internet gambling ever 
becomes legal in Florida

Internet Poker Evolution
 
Poker was first introduced to the 
United States
 
between 1810 and 1825 through New 
Orleans and originally developed from the German game
 
pochen
 
and its French derivative 
poque
.
280
 
This card game evolved to include draws and jackpots as it spread throughout the 
Mississippi valley and the American West during the second half of the 
19th C
entury.
281
 
By the 
middle of the 
20
th
 
C
entury poker games h
ad become part of American culture and a frequent 
feature in 
residences
. Due to its long history and wide popularity poker had come to represent the 
quintessentially American monetized social game.
282
 
 
While poker enjoyed tremendous popularity among casual a
nd social gamblers in homes 
and social clubs, it was not a popular casino game. In 1970 there were less than 50 poker tables in

the city of Las Vegas and less than 70 in the entire state of Nevada.
283
 
The reason for this low 
importance of poker as a casino g
ame was its lack of profitability. Poker tables must be staffed 
with dealers and supplied with chips and amenities by the casino, rounds take a relatively long 
time but the game is played in competition with the other players and usually for small stakes w
ith 
the casino only earning a rake of approximately one
-
tenth of the pot at the conclusion of each 
round. In 1970 it seemed certain that poker would remain a social game played for small stakes in 
private homes around den or basement card tables
. 
 
All that
 
changed with the convergence of three sequential events: the establishment of the 
World Series of Poker
,
 
the advent of television coverage, and the development of the Internet. In 


Vegas, a casino which at the time did not even have a poker room.
284
 
From humble beginnings this 
competition grew to include the most well
-
known poker players of the time and eventually featured 
a million dollar prize for the winner, prom

year the WSOP Jack Binion changed the tournament format from an election to a freeze
-
out 
competition
285
 
where participants post an entry fee and losing players are eliminated until the 
winner takes
 
all. As interest in the tournament grew, television coverage was initiated in 1973 by 

in the 1969 forerunner of the WSOP. The game which was favored in this
 
tournam
ent was no
-
limit 

m, where the audience could watch the first three community cards dealt to the center 
of the table 

 
the flop 

 
and suspense would build along with the betting as the fourth card 

 
the 
turn 

 
and the last community card 

 
the r
iver 

 
were dealt. This format was much more attra
ctive 
for television 


,
 
by 2000 the 
telev

surface which added even more suspense to the televised games. 
 
The advent of Internet technology revolutionized poker tournaments by allowing huge 
numbers of players
 
to qualify for tournaments through the Internet via satellite rounds. The initial 
WSOP competitions involved a dozen players in total. In 1982 the tournament drew 52 players 
and by 2000 there were 450 players.
286
 
In 2003
,
 
the worldwide popularity of poker i
n general and 
the WSOP in particular exploded when an unknown amateur with a suitably relevant moniker, 
Chris Moneymaker, won a seat at the tournament through a $40 satellite round on PokerStars and

One year later 
a total of 2,576 players contested for a $5 million first prize. In 2006, the pinnacle of WSOP 
popularity, a total of 8,773 players participated
,
288
 
the vast majority entering the tournament 
through Internet satellit
e rounds. 
 
This timely convergence of television and Internet technology had caused online poker to 
skyrocket in popularity over the early portion of the last decade. However, in 2006 Congress 

,
 
which suppressed Internet 
wagering by making it illegal for payment processors to handle gaming transactions. Internet poker 
participation in 
the United States
 
crashed after passage of this legislation and many of the more 
reputable offshore operators, i
ncluding Party Poker and 888.com, voluntarily withdrew from the 
US market. Despite UIGEA, a number of offshore sites continued to take bets from US players 


 
when the US Department of 
Justice
 
entered indictments against Full Tilt, Absolut
e
 
Poker, and Poker Stars and seized their 
assets and domain names.
289
 
T
he indictments alleged fraud and in the case of Full Tilt the creation 
of a Ponzi scheme where player deposits were used to fund operations 
and salaries paid to celebrity 
player spokespersons. After the Black Friday indictments
,
 
US Internet poker participation truly 
plunged as players lost confidence in many offshore sites and withdrew their deposits. Some 
committed or professional players eve
n established foreign residences in order to continue playing 
poker online.
290
 
After UIGEA
,
 
most major Internet poker operators turned their sights away from 
the 
United States
, a trend which accelerated after Black Friday, resulting in the development of a 
f
lourishing Internet poker in Europe. This market is dominated by Internet only operators based in 
offshore jurisdictions. It is also characterized by high volumes of players (liquidity), and intense 
competition among the top tier poker sites which results 
in low player retention, lucrative free play 
bonuses, celebrity player
-
sponsors, and due to all of the above, low operating profit margins. Since 
Black Friday, global Internet poker revenues have declined worldwide as the former boom 
continues to recede.

H
owever, this decline in the popularity of poker is expected to reverse dramatically in the 
next few years as Internet gambling becomes legal 
on a state by state basis in 
the United States
. 
On December 23, 2011, the US Department of Justice issued an opinion in response to a request 
by the New York and Illinois state lotteries
, 
revers
ing 
the
ir previous
 
position held for more than a 
decade that t
he 1961 Wire Act prohibited Internet wagering.
 
Since then three states have passed 
enabling legislation for Internet gambling in 
the United States
 
and all three follow different 
models. Nevada will offer poker only gambling through commercial providers lic
ensed by the 
state. Delaware will offer most games currently featured at the three racetrack casinos licensed by 

commercial casino operators to offer all 
games currently approved by the Division of Gaming 
Enforcement over the Internet utilizing licensed providers. In addition, at the time of this writing, 
California has multiple bills legalizing Internet poker before the legislature and other states, 
includ
ing Illinois, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Iowa, and New York have considered various bills 
to legalize Internet wagering.

December 23, 2011, reversing its long held 
position that the 1961 Wire 
Act barred state lotteries from participating in online gambling, 
13 
states have introduced legislation regarding some form of Internet gambling. Illinois and Georgia 
quickly implemented legislation permitting online lottery ticket sales and are the only t
wo US state 
lotteries currently leveraging the Internet sales channel. 
 
Currently, lotteries in New York, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Virginia 
offer some form of online subscription for lotto tickets.

Conclusion
 
T
he Internet offers great opportunities 
nationally and inter
nationally 
for all gambling 
providers, be they commercial, tribal, state lottery, or illegal/non
-
regulated, to expand their reach 
to a new audience that is often younger and more affluent than their current customers. 
Internet 
access promises to take gambl
ing beyond the casino floor and into the living rooms and bedrooms 
of Americans which opens a whole new range of opportunities as well as potential problems. 
For 
both 
the 
casino
 
industry 
and state lotteries, Internet gambling and ticket sales 
represent the
 
future 
of gaming, 
offer
ing
 
the means to 
broaden their appeal, widen their marketing footprint and 
engage 
the next generation of players 
in order to replace
 
aging player bases.
 
At the same time, the 
increased convenience of Internet play also poses the iss
ue of cannibalization of brick and mortar 

the specter of increased problem gambling
. 
 
The inability of the US Congress to debate and resolve the legality of
 
Internet gambling 
left a vacuum over the past decade which was filled by offshore operators which n
ow dominate a 
vibrant European Internet gambling
 
market generating $15 billion in 2012 and an expanding global

Overview of Gambling Regulatory Schemes
 
A gener
al description of gambling regulatory schemes, including: State
-
operated, consolidated agency 
oversight, multi
-
agency oversight, and the use of local and state commissions; authorizing and revocation 
mechanisms; taxation schemes. 
 
In this section we review
 
the structure of the Florida gaming regulatory agencies as well as 
those of a number of other states and also address how each state addresses the most critical points 
of regulation. 
 
1.
 
Overview of 

Regulatory Structures
 
Preliminarily, we observe t
hat e
ach state has
 
its own
 

venue, 
laws, 
history of gaming, priorities, etc.
,
 
but there are also 
common 
themes that
 
often, but 
not always, shine through regardless of differences. It is these themes of regulation 
that
 
can
 
be 
very instructive. Practices repeated are oft
en in place for a good reason
 

 
because they have been 
considered important in many locations over long periods. This is not to say that they should not 
change 
if circumstances warrant
, but it
 
is
 
important to
 
understand the primary principles of gaming 
regulation.
 
The overriding regulatory interest that permeates all effective legislative schemes is the 
recognized need to engender public confidence and trust in the integrity of the regulatory process 
and gambl
ing operations. To this end, regulatory agencies are charged with the responsibility of 
ensuring that unsavory and nefarious influences are prohibited from infiltrating the authorized 
gambling industry. This mandate is especially important for an industry 
that historically has been 
susceptib

 
experience, the linchpin of effective regulation is

a comprehensive licensing process designed to ferret out unsuitable persons and entities from 
participating in this highly lucra
tive industry. In order for the regulatory apparatus to succeed, it is 
imperative that licensure be limited to those persons and entities that are able to demonstrate their 
good character, honesty and integrity.
 
T
here are also significant differences in 
the regulatory structures
 
formulated to accomplish 
this laudatory objective of effective oversight.
 
Of course
,
 
states have regulatory structures that are 
designed to account for their particular population, location and statutory requirements. For 
example
,
 
in Ohio the location and even the owners of the casino locations were part of the 
referendum initiative that was approved by the voters in 2010
.
298
 
Thus
,
 
the regulatory structure did 
not have a component for 
selecting
 
an applicant, like Massachusetts, Maryl
and or Kansas. But the 
referendum did have a component for 
evaluating
 
an applicant like virtually all states
, which was 
tied to an affirmative showing of integrity and financial suitability
. 
 
In another example, many states
,
 
such as Pennsylvania, Kansas an
d Maryland, have a 
requirement for renewal of licenses, including the licenses of owners of casinos. Other states, such 
as Nevada and (at this time) New Jersey
,
 


to provide additional information under certain 
conditions, with 
some discretion 
allowed by the persons in authority
.
.
 
 
Many regulatory structures have been created and are almost unchanged from the original 
enabling legislation, some have had minor change
s
,
 
and others have been radically altered since 
first implemented. Sometimes the length of time that a regulatory structure has been in existence 
has made a significant difference as to whether there have been changes. For example
, one
 
might 
expect New Jersey and Nevada to have 
made 
some changes to their regulatory structures because 
of how long the gaming industry has been 
operating
 
in those states. Indeed
,
 
New Jersey has 
experienced
 
radical changes just in the last few years to their 
regulatory agencies: the Casino 
Control Commission and the Division of Gaming Enforcement
.
299
 
On the other hand
,
 
Nevada has 
not had significant regulatory changes in many years.
 
Other regulatory structures have changed a moderate amount to accommodate the gr
owth 
of their gaming industry but much of the regulatory apparatus has remained. For example
,
 
Iowa 
has changed primarily from a riverboat gambling state with considerable pari
-
mutuel gaming to a 
state that has mostly land
-
based casinos. Their regulatory st
ructure has primarily expanded but not 
changed in form to take these changes into account
.
300
 
Maryland has 
reconstituted
 
its Maryland 
Lottery to what is now the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control 
Commission and Maryland

Chapter 550, 
Florida Statu
t
es
,
 
provides for a comprehensive regulatory system with 
specific licensing and other regulatory requirements for the pari
-
mutuel industry. The Division of 
Pari
-

)
 
is the regulatory agency exclusively entrusted with oversight 
responsibilit
y for these various authorized forms of gaming activity at pari
-
mutuel facilities. The 
PMW
 
is a program area of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation within the 

-
201
2) As detailed 
below, the Florida regulatory design empowers the regulatory agency with broad oversight and 
licensing responsibilities over all participants in the pari
-
mutuel gaming industry.
 
The Division has also been designated by the Florida Legislatur
e as the State Compliance 

Gaming Compact between the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the State (
s
ection 285.710, Florida 
Statutes)
.
 
The Seminole Tribe operates
 
seven casinos in Broward, Hillsborough, Collier, Glades, 
and Hendry counties. 
 
Notably, 
PMW
 
has no authority to regulate other forms of gaming activity such 
as lottery, 
bingo or so
-
called 
cruises to nowhere. The Florida Lottery regulates lottery operation
s. Counties 
that permit bingo have their own individual ordinances which govern their operation
. 
We also note 
that the Miccosukee Tribe does not have a 
gaming comp
act with the State and therefore operates 
exclusi
vely under federal jurisdiction as a Class I
I gaming entity.
 
The Director of 
PMW
 
is Leon M. Biegalski. The Office of the Director is responsible for 
such areas as budget planning; rule promulgation; policy development; legislative analysis of

proposed legislation; strategic planning; and enforcement
 
of administrative actions. There are six 
functional units which operate under the management of the Office of the Director: Auditing; 
Investigations; Operations; Slot Operations; Revenue and Financial Analysis; and State 
Compliance Agency.
 
The Office of I
nvestigations is responsible for conducting background investigations of 
applicants for permits and occupational licenses and the enforcement and investigation of 
suspected violations that occur in pari
-
mutuel wagering, 
cardroom
 
and slot machine gaming 
fac
ilities. 
PMW says
 
typical investigative cases include falsified license applications, criminal 
history checks, animal cruelty, and the use of performance altering medications and/or illegal 
substances during races. The Office of Investigations also conduct
s inspections of all new pari
-
mutuel, 
cardroom
 
and slot machine facilities prior to opening and all facilities are routinely 
monitored by investigators to ensure compliance with the gaming statute and applicable 
regulations.
 
The Office of Auditing performs
 
annual compliance audits to verify that statutory 
accounting procedures are utilized and to identify any fraudulent activity. The auditors reconcile 
pari
-
mutuel wagering pools for more than 80,000 races and games annually to ensure 
integrity in 
the wageri
ng activity
. 
 
The Office of Operations is responsible for ensuring that the day
-
to
-
day operation of races 
and games are conducted appropriately, consistent with the statute and regulations. 
It is 
also 
responsible for administering the licensing process. Al
l individuals and businesses who work or 
conduct business at a racetrack, fronton, 
cardroom
 
or slot machine facility or who have access to 
money wagered, restricted areas and/or racing animals, are required to obtain an occupational 
license issued by 
PMW
. 
Slot facility occupations requiring a license include, but are not limited 
to: slot operations managers; slot shift managers; floor supervisors; slot tech supervisors; slot 
technicians; slot attendants; security and surveillance personnel; count room and c
age personnel; 
information systems managers; systems analyst supervisors; operations analyst supervisors; and 
revenue audit managers and supervisors. 
 
Every racing and 
cardroom
 
occupational license applicant is fingerprinted, and then re
-
fingerprinted at t
he time of license renewal five years after initial licensure. Every slot machine 
occupational license applicant is fingerprinted and then again every three years at renewal. Slot 
machine licensees pay an annual license fee of $2 million and a regulator fe
e of $250,000. 
 
A slot machine business entity occupational license for slot machine management 
companies, service companies, manufacturers, vendors, distributors and testing laboratories is 
$1,000 for a one
-
year license and $2,000 for a three
-
year license
. All officers, directors and 
shareholders with 5 percent or more interest in the business entity are required to be fingerprinted. 
Those persons who need to have access to the slot machine facility are also required to obtain a 
Slot Machine Business Emplo
yee Occupational License.

Annual

Cardroom
 
business licenses are issued to any

ting business with a 
cardroom
. In addition, 
cardroom
 
employee occupational licenses are required for all 
cardroom
 
employees except food 
service, security, maintenance and 
mutuel
 
teller employees. Possession of this license does not 
allow access to any rest
ricted area other than the 
cardroom
. A pari

license is necessary for supervisors of food service, security, maintenance and mutu

l teller 
employees who require access to restricted areas of the track as well as the 
cardroom

pari
-
mutuel/
cardroom
 
employee license is needed for food service, security, maintenance and

.
 
The Office of Slot Operations oversees the pari
-
mutu
el facilities that have slot machine 
gaming. A key element of that regulatory oversight is to ensure that every slot machine has been 
certified by an independent testing laboratory. The Office of Revenue and Financial Analysis is 
responsible for safeguardi
ng and accounting for state revenues derived from authorized pari
-
mutuel gaming activity.
 
T
he State Compliance Agency conducts inspections of 
Indian
 
gaming facilities.

Applicants for Slot Machine licensing must be 
21 years 
of age or older
. 
Applicants must submit his/her fingerprints for a criminal history 
background check and pay the 
$40.50 fingerprint processing fee when submitting an 
initial application. Every 
three
 
years after the initial fingerprint submission, upon 
renewal, the applicant must pay $16.50
,
 
The disclosure forms required for natural persons require disclosure of prior
 
license and 
criminal history information among other things. Though the disclosure requirements are 
substantial the forms that are used by 
PMW
 
do not include
 
a document on the order of the
 
multi
-
jurisdictional disclosure form provided by the International
 
Association of Gaming Regulators
,
302
 
which is utilized by many 
casino gaming 
regulatory agencies. While this specific form is not 
essential to the process the disclosure of information that is required on that form is critical to the 
process of investigatio
ns. 
 
Some specific information such as a financial net worth statement for natural person 
qualifiers is not required by the forms now utilized by 
PMW
.
 
Additional Functions of 
PMW
 
 
In addition to these functions of a typical gaming regulatory agency for slo
t machine 
facilities
,
 
PMW also has comparable responsibilities for pari
-
mutuel wagering. The regulation of 
pari
-
mutuel wagering also includes many other functions such as the collection of urine and blood 
samples. PMW utilizes a racing laboratory under con
tract 
that
 
collected over 86,000 samples in 
FY 
2012.
 

agency addresses almost all the regulatory functions, including pari
-
mutuel wagering.

Changes to the Division because of Slot Machine Licensing
 
The absorption by 
PMW
 
of the licensing function has significantly added to 
its
 
staff. 
B

the implementation of 
slot ma
chine l
icensing
,
 
the agency had 62 full
-
time employees. In 
FY
 
2013 
there were 115
 
appropriated
 
employees, 50 of which were dedicated to slot machine licensing. 
Four
 
full
-
time
-
equivalent positions
 
were added for oversight 
of t
he c
ompact between the State and 
the Seminole Tribe. 
There would
 
be significantly 
more staff added if full casinos we
re 
implemented.
 
E
ven with this increase in the 
PMW
 
budget it is apparent that 
the agency
 
is still heavily 
dedicated, in staff, to the regulation of pari
-
mutuel operations rather than slot operations, even 

of the slot machine 
operations. This is due to the numbers of fa
cilities

operations.
 
b.
 
Lottery
 
The Florida Lottery requires submission of a company application form and a host of other 
requirements for approval to be a lottery retailer
.
303
 
The application requires identification of 
the 
persons associated with the company who have a 10
 
percent
 
holding and the identification of any 
criminal record for those persons. The disclosure form also requires a short explanation of the 
business operation. 
 
Retailers must agree to a seven

addresses Public Entity Crime and the

charitable organizations

scholas
tic works and other similar activities. 
All charitable organizations must be qualified for 
exemption from federal income tax as an exempt organization under the provisions of section 
501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
The statute mandates that all procee
ds resulting from the conduct of the bingo games are 
donated to charitable organizations, less actual business expenses for the operation, conduct and 
playing of bingo. The statute strictly prohibits the net proceeds from bingo games from being used 
for an
y other purpose.
 
Section 849.0931, Florida Statutes, contains various other provisions intended to assure 
that the primary benefactors of the authorized bingo games are actually the charitable, non
-
profit 
and veterans' organizations, and not private person
s. These include requirements that the operators 
must be bona fide members of the organization conducting the bingo game, must not be 
compensated for the operation of the bingo game, and must be residents of the community where 
the organization is located.
 
The protective statutory provisions also include requirements that the 
property upon which the bingo games are held must either be owned by the worthy organizations 
or leased by worthy organizations for not less than one year, provided that the rent is no
t 
unreasonable for the location.

Bingo i
s not regulated by the State
. However, municipalities and/or counties that permit 
bingo have their own local ordinances that govern its operation. Most municipalities require a 
business tax license, or occupational 
license, to conduct bingo. Some require a special exemption 
waiver for that activity (bingo) in order to qualify for a business tax license. The licenses are issued 
annually and require copies of IRS financial statements.

The Gaming Commission has established a regulatory structure
 
that Spectrum believes is 
thorough and substantial. Ed 
Jenkins is Director of Compliance and Regulations for Gaming and 
has significant experience with the FBI a
nd with the gaming industry. He indicates he 
has 
worked 
for
 
the tribe since 2001 and has established a regulatory agency
 
that was designed to be 
indep
endent and capable. Perhaps an example of this independence is the requirement that 
surveillance departments within the casinos are required to report to the Gaming Co
mmission and 
not to operations.
 
The surveillance department is critical to internal contr
ols because it is designed to be the 
eyes and ears to any crime that may be occurring at the casino floor. It is the last line of defense 
against crimes committed by any patron or emplo

 
experience
,
 
often casino manag
ement will balk at providing sufficient staff to the department and 
argue against creating a reporting line which establishes a point of view which is free from 
influence by casino management. Spectrum believes a reporting line 
that
 
goes to casino operatio
ns 
leaves a casino vulnerable to a host of crimes, including collusion at the highest levels. 
 
The fact that the Gaming Commission requires this independence is 
one 
sign that 
regulatory requirements are being taken seriously. There are other signs as well.
 
Gaming 
Commission 
staff is
 
present at the casinos 24 hours a day, seven days a week
. 
The license process, 
including the licensing or registration of all employees, seems significant (though Spectrum notes 
there is no renewal to a license)
.
312
 
The fact that someone of significant experience such as Ed 
Jenkins was hired is another indication of the significance 
that the Seminole Tribe has
 
placed on 
regulation
.
 
I
t
 
is also important
 

s
 
reporting line appears also to be independent from 
casino management influence.

Regulation in Other States 
 
Spectrum reviewed and analyzed gaming laws and interviewed representatives from 
several other states. In addition
, we reviewed
 
the Florida Senate interim report of October 2010
,
 
Review of Casino Gam
ing i
n Other States
.
313
 
 
Based on our experience working 
for, 
with, and 
studying, state regulatory agencies across the country, we selected several gaming commissions 
for discussion in this report that we believe would be insightful into various regulatory m
odels.
 
a.
 
Introduction: 
Establishment of Standards
 
All states and many foreign jurisdictions require companies to apply to be a casino 
operator, and require companies to show qualification in such areas as good character, honesty, 
integrity, the absence of a 
criminal record
,
 
and financial stability. There are variations in the extent 
to which persons associated with the company and associated companies must file and establish 
these standards. Most
,
 
if not all
,
 
states 
that
 
have implemented casino gaming, or are
 
in the process 
of doing so, such as Massachusetts, Maryland, Kansas and Ohio, require parent companies as well 
as all those natural person
s
 
with an ownership interest beyond a certain percent (5
 
percent
 
is often 
used)
 
to
 
file and establish these qualifica
tions.
 
In addition, those officers, board members and 
executives deemed to be qualifiers due to their prominence in the company must demonstrate these 
qualifications.
 
Since these associated companies and natural persons can have an influence over 
the casin
o operator it is incumbent upon a state to require the establishment of such standards. 
 
The selection of casino operators is the starting point of establishing public trust in the 
casino industry as one of integrity
. I
t is critical that this step be compl
eted carefully and thoroughly. 
Through this process the state is not only establishing that the gaming industry is one of integrity
,
 
but that the selection of who will be a casino operator has been done with integrity by the state. In 
cases where the selec
tion process was called into question (
see Chapter II[E][1]
), the expense to 
the state of re
-
establishing that trust can be enormous. 
 
b.
 
Bid Process or Non
-
Competitive Application
 
Beyond requiring of the qualification standards
 
noted above
, 
licensing decisio
ns depend 
on basic policy:
 
The state must decide how and in what way it wishes to limit the numbers of 
operating casinos, or whether unlimited numbers of casinos may be issued. 
There are two primary 
methods for awarding licenses: competitive bidding and no
n
-
competitive applications. The former 
process occurs in situations where there are a finite number of licenses permitted in a particular 
region, while the latter method is utilized in instances where an infinite number of licensees 
are
 
permitted by law. F
or both methods, there are still essential qualification requirements relating to 

an

If 
a s
tate determines the demand is great enough
,
 
an 
unlimited numbers of casinos 
may
 
be 
appropriate, but 
the 
s
tate
 
must address if that level of competition would 
potentially saturate the 
market and 
negatively affect the financial viability of the businesses involved. Nevada
 
allow
s
 
unlimited numbers of casinos in unlimited locations
; a
ll 
other states have some limitations. 
 
Limitation to a specific area of the state can create a destination area. For example
,
 
New 

area. 
S
tates such as Pennsylva
nia, Maryland, Kansas and Massachusetts limit the number and types 
of casinos that are permitted and their location. Within those limits these states required a 
competitive bid process that required applicants to show the value of their application in such
 
areas 
as economic development and job creation in the area. 
 
c.
 
Regulatory Structures Consolidated or Separated Oversight
 
Alt
hough generalizations can be made about regulatory models
,
 
no two states
 
have 
regulatory agencie
s that
 
are 
truly 
comparable
 
in all re
spects
. There are
 
simply too many unique 
forums, too many different types of gaming venues, and too many unique legal structures
 
in every 
state. The states addressed below
, while not intended to be a complete survey of every state, are 
illus

of
 
both
 
the uniqueness of different states

 
regulatory structures a
nd their similarities.
 
Massachusetts
 
T
he Massachusetts Gaming Commission
 

 
has begun the process of 
awarding four casino licenses,
 
was created
 
by law 
in November 2011
.
 
That law 
provid
ed for 
commercial casinos in the state
,
 
created a provision which could allow for a
n Indian casino,
 
and 
brought the pari
-
mutuel industry under the auspices of the 
MGC.
314
 
This law also created one agency
, whose five members serve full
-
time, and 
which 
consoli
dated responsibilities and authorities for investigations, prosecution of violations, policy 
formulation and decision making
. 
With the exception of the Massachusetts Lottery, the MGC has 
wide reaching purview over gaming matters
.
 
 
Thus the MGC is an 
example of an agency which has consolidated oversight. An important 
part of this consolidation is the Investigation and Enforcement Bureau (

IEB

enforcement agent for regulatory matters
.

315
 
The IEB has numerous responsibilities, including 
th
e authority to conduct or limit investigations
,
316
 
the 
decision on certain license matters and the

holding of 
relevant

.
317
 
The IEB is a law enforcement agency and works directly with and 
will include members of the Massachusetts 
State Police. Because 
of its designation as a law 
enforcement agency it can request fingerprint criminal records checks directly from the FBI. The

ability to investigate or prosecute violations of this chapter or the regulations adopted by the 
commission

318
 
In many states
,
 
there are agencies or bureaus 
that
 
have the 
responsibilities
 
of the IEB 
b
ut 
which are separate from the 
gaming commission/
decision
-
making authority. 
S
ome of these 
agencies are part of or connected to the State Police and many times they report to the Attorney 
General of the state. In Massachusetts
 
the IEB reports to the MGC
,
 
wh
ich has ultimate authority 
over license decisions and policy matters. And the IEB is only one of a wide range of consolidated 
responsibilities under the auspices of the MGC. 
 
Another consolidation that has taken place in Massachusetts is the fiscal authori
ty and 
responsibility which has been given to the MGC. The MGC is the trustee for the many funds 
created by the Expanded Gaming Act and for all revenue collected by from the commercial 
casinos
.
319
 
In many other states trustee responsibilities are under the a
uthority of the State 
Treasurer.
 
Still another responsibility under the MGC is that of the Racing Commission. The Racing 
Commission was a separate agency until passage of the Expanded Gaming Act, but now is under 
the authority of the MGC. Thus the MGC is a
 
host racing commission and an off
-
track betting 
commission and also has responsibilities over simulcasting
.
320
 
Despite this, the MGC is primarily 
a gaming commission, with the majority of its resources and staff devoted to casino gaming. 
 
In Massachusetts
,
 
the extensive responsibilities of the MGC can be represented in chart 
form, as indicated below. All functions, relating to gaming, with the exception of the lottery, are 
encompassed under the purview of the MGC, although the Attorney General also will have
 
investigative authority into casino criminal activities.

Iowa has a primary agency 
that 
regulates the 18 commercial casinos in the sta
te but oth
e
r 
agencies are utilized in more minor roles. The Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission (

IRGC

) 
performs most typical functions including licensing and the oversight of daily operations. 
Employees and gaming related companies are licensed. Investigations, however, are primarily

The IRGC 
is similar to the

The IRGC is responsible for the 
presently operating pari

,
 
there are also considerable differences with the Florida

fewer

Regulatory Overs
ight Critical Functions
 
Regulatory agencies that oversee commercial casinos have a number of typical functions. 
While there are variations in the details as to the depth of regulation and the specifics of procedures, 
the 
types
 
of functions have become
 
stan
dard in almost all states.

140
 
 
Some of the most critical of those functions include licensing, ongoing review of daily 
operations, internal control requirements
,
 
and auditing. Each of these is addressed below
:
 

 
Licensing
:
 
A
ll regulatory agencies investigate and make a determination regarding the 
qualifications of companies and natural persons that apply to operate, work in or service 
casinos. Some states have more extensive requirements than others. All states require 
casino
 
operators and companies that supply gaming related equipment or services, such 
as slot machines, to file for a license. 
S
ome states, such as Pennsylvania and 
Massachusetts, require companies that supply non
-
gaming goods or services to file for 
a license u
nder certain conditions (in Pennsylvania a certification, which is similar to a 
license, is required). In Massachusetts
,
 
the MGC may require any vendor regularly 
conducting over $250,000 of business with a gaming licensee within a 12
-
month perio
d
,
 
or $100,
000 of business in a three
-
year period
,
 
to be licensed as a gaming vendor.
337
 
The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board requires companies that conduct over 
$500,000 worth of business to be certified.
338
 
 
Without having some mechanism for a regulatory agency to 
review all contracts with a 
casino operator, even those that relate to non
-
gaming companies, the regulatory agency 
may be unaware of the movement of large amounts of money or the infiltration of 
organized criminal elements. The need for close examination o
f non
-
gaming 
enterprises
,
 
such as construction companies
,
 
became evident in New Jersey in the 
Bayshore Rebar matter, among others.
339
 
Similarly, almost all states require either licensing or registration of employees 
who
 
work in the gaming areas. Some states
, such as Massachuse
tts, also require employees 
who
 
work in non
-
gaming positions to be registered.
340
 
Spectrum 
has found that it is 
good policy to require licensing or registration of such persons because of the potential 
for such individuals to be involved 
directly or through collusion in theft or other crimes 
in a casino operation. 
 
The attention to detail of this process is critical as it is the first step in assuring integrity 
of the casino industry in that state.

Ongoing Review of Daily Operations:
 
Virt
ually all states also maintain a presence in 
the casino. The extent of this presence varies from a 24/7 inspector or agent 
at a 
publicly 
visible level, such as exists in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Ohio, to a limited law 
enforcement presence such as wh
at now exists in New Jersey
. 
The inspector or agent 
presence includes greater scrutiny of ongoing gaming operations and transactions.
 
As 
happened in New Jersey, such requirements may be stringent in the early years and then 
relaxed somewhat as both the ind
ustry and regulatory system mature.
341
 

 
Internal control requirements: 
V
irtually all states have requirements 
that
 
require the 
casino operation to address internal controls within their operations. Internal control 
requirements 
may mandate 
that certain depart
ments
,
 
such as surveillance and internal 
audit
, are created. Internal control requirements may also require
 
separation of such 
duties as income control and table games to prevent incompatible functions
.
 

 
Auditing
: 
R
egulatory agencies have an audit function 
over the casino operations, 
though the extent and frequency of such audits 
may vary
. At a minimum
, best practices 
demonstrate that
 
the casino regulatory agency must conduct random unscheduled audits 
relating to
 
the collection of gaming revenue. 
 

 
Underage 
gambling and problem gambling
: 
All jurisdictions are justifiably 
concerned with the problems associated with underage gambling and 
problem
/
compulsive gambling. Statutory schemes attempt to cope with such important 
public policy concerns. One such endeavor 
entails the formation of a self
-
exclusion list 
whereby self
-
proclaimed problem gamblers can voluntarily decide to be excluded from 
gambling activity. Once a person is placed on the self
-
exclusion list, the casino operator 
is obligated to take appropriate m
easures to enforce the exclusion from gaming activity, 
including a cessation of direct marketing to the individual. With respect to underage 
gambling, such activity is generally harshly punished, both as to the underage patron 
and the casino operator.
 
e.
 
Tabl
e of Organization of Regulatory Agencies
 
Organizations of regulatory agencies are largely divided by the functions detailed above 
and by functions that allow for these actions, with some additional functions that are needed in 
most government agencies. In 
2010
,
 
Spectrum did a review of gaming agencies that address the 
types of tables of organization. This report will 
borrow
 
from that earlier research.
342
 
 
The following are departments or offices that are typical in casino regulatory agencies:

Investigations.
 
Casino regulatory agencies have staff devoted to inve
stigations, though 
as detailed in Sub
section
 
C above
, investigatory functions are often separated from those 
function
s that
 
decide licensing. 
 

 
Licensing
: The license function often has its own staff 
beca
us
e the specific activities of 
licensing are often most efficiently accomplished by those familiar with applications, 
the review of investigatory reports and data collection relevant to the process. 
 

 
Operational Review of Casinos
: Casino regulatory agencie
s often have an inspection 
or agent staff that is devoted to the operations of casinos. In some cases there is both a 
law enforcement and civilian presence. A civilian presence in a casino operation can 
assist in the oversight of internal controls and is l
ess expensive than a law enforcement 
presence. A law enforcement presence is necessary also for criminal purposes.
 

 
Internal Controls
: There is typically a group of staff devoted to the review of the 

sdictions that involve larger 
casinos, the internal control plans of a casino are submitted for review and approval by 
this group
 

 
Financial Analysis: 
Casino regulatory agencies
 
are responsible for the collection of 
revenue, thus the analysis of trends in i
ncoming revenue is useful and possibly critical.
 

 
Auditing: 
Auditing of the considerable
 
sums of revenue in a casino industry by the 
regulatory agency is especially critical. Nearly all agencies employ staff devoted to such 
functions. 
 

 
Other functions:
 
Casi
no regulatory agencies are in great need of services in 
Information Technology since the management of revenue and license data is an 
ongoing, regular and challenging process. There is also a need for the accounting for 
and transfer of funds, as many regul
atory agencies are the trustee of funds. There is also 
a need for typical services such as administration, human resources, and public 
information dissemination. 
 
Regardless of the 
regulatory scheme employed, Spectrum has found that regulation is most 
effe
ctive when it provides the following, as noted 
in the aforementioned 2010 report:
343
 

 
Provide
s
 
for sufficient regulatory oversight by creating a unit or team that is 
frequently 
on
 
the casino floor, accessible to the public and visible to casino employees
 

 
Crea
te
s
 
a license structure that addresses all those that participate in the gaming
 
industry, including the casino licensees, the companies that service those licensees
 
and 
the employees. It is only by examining the background of all those who seek to
 
particip
ate in the industry that integrity can be assured.

143
 
 

 
Create
s
 
a decision
-
making structure that allows for independence from the
 
investigatory 
branch of the regulatory structure. In addition, sufficiently staff the
 
decision
-
making 
agency to ensure it has adequ
ate resources to carry out its duties.
 
f.
 
Full
-
 
and Part
-
Time 
Decision
-
Making Authorities
 
Agencies in all casino gaming states have full
-
time staff.
344
 
However, as documented in 
Subsection C above
, no two states are the same in the composition of the staff or even in the 
number of agencies that employ them. There is also a mixed bag regarding the decision making 
authorities (often called commissions) in each state. 
 
The argument for a full time gam
ing commission can go back to the time of Abscam at the 
start of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (Commission).
345
 
At that time the 
Commission was part
-
time (except for the Chairman who was full
-
time). After Abscam
,
 
the law 
in New Jersey was changed 
to require full time commissioners. A full time commissioner, which 
is allowed no other occupation, is likely to be more focused on their positions. The tradeoff may 
be that full time commissioners should be paid a full time salary. 
 
Two of the most recent
ly formed commissions, the Ohio Casino Control Commission and 
the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, went in different directions when they formed their 
agencies.
346
 
As is also documented in the aforementioned Spectrum report of 2010, there is no 
specific tren
d on this issue.
347
 
The appropriate answer for a state forming a new gaming 
commission would depend in the size and complexity of the gaming industry. Surely the larger 
gaming industries would require more license making decisions and a full
-
time position ma
y be 
more appropriate. 
 
3.
 
Application Forms
 
a.
 
Form of Application and Background Investigations
 
The basic application form that is used by many casino regulatory agencies for natural 
persons is the mult
i
-
jurisdictional
 
personal history disclosure
 
form.
348
 
This form is often

jurisdictional form requires disclosure of information on family 
background, offices and positions, employment and lic
ensing data, testimony before a license 
agency, company ownership information, civil and criminal arrest history, financial data, and a net 
worth statement. 
 
Gaming agencies also often require a Business Entity Disclosure Form

Con
fidentiality of Information 
 
When crafting a specific license application that requires certain background information 
to be provided by the applicant, in advance of the requisite suitability background investigation, 
an important consideration for any reg
ulatory agency involves a determination of whether material 
provided in an application is to be treated as confidential or whether it would be made available 
upon request to the public. Generally, most gaming jurisdictions consider personal information 
con
tained in an application, especially financial data, to be confidential. Some jurisdictions, most 
notably Ohio and Massachusetts, which have broad right
-
to
-
know laws, have narrowly drawn rules 
governing confidentiality of material received. By contrast, Ne
w Jersey affords broad 
confidentiality protections for information submitted as part of the application process. The

of suspected wrongdoing, examination of int

the imposition of disciplinary action for violations of applicable regulatory requirements. 
Sanctions vary from stern warning letters to the imposition of fines, to suspension of licenses for 
a finite term
, and in the most egregious cases, to the revocation of licenses. Depending on the 
gravity of the accusation, there may be a disciplinary adjudicatory hearing to resolve the matter.
 
It is noteworthy that a gaming license is considered to be a revocable pri

a right of entitlement. Common violations applicable to the operating entity include

Enforcement of Illegal Gambling
 
We spoke to official
s
 
in 
Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania and foun
d that t
he investigation of illegal gambling is handled by law enforcement 
officers
 
(as opposed to regulators)
. Whether the state gaming regulatory agency regulates illegal 
gambling or not depends primarily on whether they are authorized to do so based on 
whether they 
have law enforcement authority, in most cases. Even when the state gaming regulatory agency has 
such authority
,
 
the actual prosecution of such matters is normally referred to the county or local 
prosecuting authority. 
 
Ohio is one such
 
example
. The Ohio Casino Control 
Commission
 
has
 
authority under the 
casino control act
350
 
to levy and collect penalties for some noncriminal violations. Criminal 

ma
tter the casino control act is a fairly new law and the actual prosecution of criminal matters 
depends on the circumstances. Internet cafes have been of major concern in Ohio. The addressing

however we were 
informed that there was recently a further complication
:
 
Some
 
I
nternet cafes, in addition to using 
the normal internet machines in the cafes, were employing the equivalent of slot machines. The 

hio Casino Control Commission 
staff cooperated in the matter 

 
which we found to be a common theme among states
. Illegal gambling often comes in forms that 
are not completely anticipated. In this case
,
 
the
 
Casin
o
 
Control Commission
 
staff was used to help 
d
etermine the nature of the machines and whether they met the definition of slot machines.
352
 
There are law enforcement agents with the 
Casino Commission
,
 
but prosecution for criminal 
illegal gambling would come from other 
state 
offices. Internet cafes are a 
subject unto 
themselves.
353
 
In Mass
a
chusetts the State Police handle illegal gambling investigations
,
 
but it
 
i
s importan
t 
to note that the Massachusett
s Gaming Commission 
has a State P
olice unit
 
assigned to it. Either 
the Gaming Commission unit of the State 
Polic
e
 
or another branch of the State
 
takes responsibility 
for the matter, dependent on 
the 
nature of the type of illegal gambling. 
 

somewhat
 
different. There are two primary agencies in New Jersey: 
the Casino Control Commission and t
he Division of Gaming Enforcement
. Gaming Enforcement
 
is the prosecutorial arm f
or civil matters, and also has State P
olice assigned to it, under the purview 

s Office. The State P
olice in 
Gaming Enforcement
 
would be involved in 
inve
stigating illegal gambling. 
 
In Pennsylvania
,
 
the Gaming Control Board has no authority over illegal gambling. 
The 
State P
olice would take the lead on those matters and likely would work with local law 
enforcement
 
and prosecuting authorities, depending on 
the nature of the illegal gambling
. 
 
In Maryland the Lottery and Gaming Control Agency 
has no
 
authority over illegal gaming. 

,
 
illegal gaming matters are not addressed 
by the Iowa and Racing Commissi
on. Instead such matters are turned over to the Division of 
Criminal Investigation.
 
In Kansas
,
 
however
,
 
the Racing and Gaming 
Commission
 
does take the lead on such 
matters. There are enforcement agents at the 
Racing and Gaming Commission that
 
can make 
arre
sts on such issues. Prosecution, as is the case in many states, rests with the local prosecutors.

Costs: How Regulator
s are Addressing Expansion of Gaming
 
The regulatory model that has been accepted 
in 
many jurisdictions is that the cost of 
investigations should be paid for by applicants
. As 
Spectrum noted in its
 
2010 report for the State 
of New Hampshire
,
 

A subcomponent
 
of this category is that those companies and individuals
 
applying for a casino or vendor license should be required to pay for all costs associated
 
with the 
conduct of their background investigations. This requirement allows the
 
regulatory agency to 
under
take what are often complex and multi
-
faceted entity and other
 
investigations without having 
the taxpayers of the state pay for these types of
 
investigations

355

Gaining an Expertise in Casino Gaming 
 
The regulation of casino gam
bl
ing is unique 
from other t
ypes of business activity 
because 
of the speed of the transactions, the amount of money that changes hands and the way in which 
transactions are completed. Unlike any other type of business money changes hands in some cases 
with no documentation. For examp
le at table games the allocation of chips
 
by the dealer to the 
customer
 
after the playing of a hand
, (or the throwing of dice, or the spinning of a wheel, etc.) 
permits no documentation
. 
 
The types of transactions at slot machines are comparable in some re
spects to transactions 
in other businesses but it too is challenging in a regulatory sense. T
here 
can be
 
multiple 
transactions over short periods between a machine and a 
patron
 
involving what 
might
 
be a great 
deal of money. 
Jackpots worth seven figures can
 
originate from the risking of a very small amount 
from the patron. 
 
Because of the nature of the business there are unique types of crimes that will be attempted 
in the gaming industry. Criminals can be attracted simply because of the large amounts of mon
ey 
involved, but there are also ample unique ways to commit crimes in casinos. Two examples, of

many, are card cheats at table games and attempts at altering the computer chips in the slot 
machines. 
 
The regulatory structure that a state adopts, and all th
e functions involved in that structure, 
including investigations, audits, licensing, etc., are all ultimately designed with one purpose in 
mind: to create an appropria
te gaming and business activity and 
to mi
nimize any criminal activity. 
The states

 
collec
tion of 
gaming 
revenue depends on the fulfillment of this purpose, but just as 

integrity and fairness of the 
gaming industry. 
 
While gaining an expertise in the types of transactions in casino gaming is critical to 
regulation of the gaming industry, so too is gaining an expertise in the types of investigations 
necessary in the examination of applicants for casino operators and the
 
transparency of the 
licensing process. Casino gaming operators are sometimes parts of multinational companies. The 
awarding of a license to operate a casino can be lucrative for a company. Thus the investigation, 
the consideration of the investigatory fin
dings by the licensing authority and the awarding of the 
license are regulatory matters that must be addressed with thorough understanding and 
considerable deliberation. 
 
While it may be argued that there are many 
advantages
 
and disadvant
ages to expanding 
gaming
,
 
we believe there is no valid argument
 
for the expansion of gaming
 
without
 
taking 
the 
proper 
regulatory measures. While a strong regulatory structure may be expensive to implement, 
this expense is typically borne by the gaming industry and not taxpa
yers.
356
 
On the other hand, a 
weak or flawed regulatory system will invite nefarious and criminal activity, will fail to
 
assure 
integrity of operations
, and will not maintain the public trust and confidence in the regulatory 
system. Weak or flawed regulation
s is neither a model which is acceptable to the 
s
tate nor a model 
which is an acceptable business practice to the casino industry that is regulated. 
 
7.
 
 
Other
 
Critical Factors in the Regulatory Structure
 
T
here are advantages to creating a consolidated 
gaming
 
agency
,
 
such as the maximum use 
of resources and the prioritization of functions. The danger in a consolidated agency is illustrated 
in the early Pennsylvania model. As explained in the grand jury findings
,
 
there was a bias created 
in the agency toward th
e awarding of licenses and the minimizing of investigative findings that 
could delay such licenses. The present Pennsylvania model incorporates a more independent 
reporting
 
line for the investigative functions
.
 
Spectrum 
has found
 
there can be advantages in
 
separate agencies whi
ch have some built
-
in and intentional overlap of functions. In the Kansas model, for example, there is little if any 
expense in any overlapping functions, but there is a greater assurance of integrity in having more 
                                        
        
 
356
 
The norm in the regulation of casino gaming is to r
equire the payment for investigations and other 
regulatory functions through fees and billings paid by casino applicants and operators.

than one agency in

,
 
any overlap should be 
clearly defined and be designed to complement the functions of each agency.

Conclusion
 
R
egulatory structures are almost impossible to place into a few models, as e
ach
 
state h
as 
unique features relating to 
its
 
gaming industry. Spectrum believes that a consolidated regulatory 
agency or a group of agencies which share responsibility can both complete their functions in a 
competent manner. However there are a number of important c
onsiderations. There are a number 
of themes of regulation which almost always shine through regardless of the state, the gaming 
venues, or the number of casinos or where they are located in the state. These are not themes of a 
consolidated model of all reg
ulatory issues or a model that is divided between numerous agencies. 
The theme
s
 
of regulatory models over casino gaming have to do with the types of regulation that 
casino gaming demands.

policies while protecting the overall public interest. While the entire scope
 
of policies to be 
advanced will 

 
and arguably should 

 
vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, certain goals would 
be considered universal. Such goals would include:
 

 
Promoting public confidence in gaming as both a leisure activity
 
for the public,
 
and as 
an investment opportunity
 
that would generate interest from casino operators seeking 
an attractive return on invested capital.
 

 
Fostering public confidence and trust in the integrity of the regulatory process and 
gaming operations
 

 
Ensuring that individuals 
and business entities involved in gaming meet universally 
accepted standards of good character, honesty and integrity.
 

 
Ensuring the prohibition of unsuitable persons and entities from participating in the 
gaming industry. 
 

 
Developing, overseeing and monito
ring programs to address problem gambling, 
including reviewing responsible
-
gaming policies and practices, while maintaining and 
enforcing exclusion lists, including self
-
exclusion.

Optimizing financial benefit to the jurisdiction from multiple revenue streams, including 
gaming taxes, employment taxes and tax revenue generated from other sources, such as
 
expanded tourism and purchases of goods and services.
 

 
Maintaining flexibility in writing the rules that govern gaming to make sure that 
regulators are able to adapt to changes in technology and to revise and reform 
regulations as circumstances change, and
 
as regulators become more familiar and 
comfortable with evolving industry practices.
 
Individual states, as they develop and customize their own statutory and regulatory 
governing structures, can layer on additional goals that are specific to their own eco
nomic, 
political, demographic and competitive landscapes. Such ancillary goals can vary, but often 
include the following:
 

 
Promoting tourism
 

 
Reviving or improving urban areas
 

 
Creating employment opportunities
 

 
Enhancing the conventions and meetings business
 

 
Creating opportunities for other businesses within the jurisdiction
 

 
Attracting additional capital investment
 
Establishing such goals is relatively straightforward. Achieving them is often difficult for 
the following reasons:
 

 
Once a license is issued, the p
ower of regulators and lawmakers to effect change 
diminishes.
 

 
Sometimes, goals can conflict with each other. For example, a goal of maximizing 
license fees can conflict with a goal of maximizing capital investment.
 

 
The market does not always cooperate.
 
Sti
ll,
 
jurisdictions that have the ability to establish a competitive bidding process would, 
with all else being equal, be more likely to achieve goals, since applicants for licensure have more 
incentive to establish ambitious plans to achieve goals.
 
We have 
witnessed that in various states with competitive processes, including 
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. At this writing, Massachusetts is pursuing a competitive bidding 
process, and various applicants have made it clear that they are developing robust polic
ies to 
achieve goals that range from promoting tourism to training existing Massachusetts adults for the 
jobs that will be created.
 
Absent a competitive bidding process, gaming tends to evolve either as a system in which 
pari
-
mutuel facilities are grandfat
hered in, sometimes with requirements for significant capital 
  
 
Florida Gaming Study, Part 1
-
A 
                                                              
151
 
 
investment, or with 
no statutory limit on the number of
 
licenses in specific geographic regions 
such as the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, Las Vegas or Atlantic City.
 
Whether a licensing process is 
competitive or not, however, the ability of regulators to take 
action after a license is issued diminishes quickly and dramatically. Absent specific violations that 
would warrant fines
 
or either the revocation or non
-
renewal of a license
, regulators have a
 
limited 
ability to prod operating licensees in specific policy directions. The larger goal then in the effective 
regulation of gaming is to align the goals of the public and private sectors.
 
Some of these goals 
noted
 
above may seem to be contradictory. Fo
r example, a single 
licensing jurisdiction would be tasked with developing a positive investment climate while 
addressing serious policy issues, such as crime and problem gambling. Such seeming 
contradictions can be best addressed by adhering to what econo

a system in which
 
the interests of
 
all stakeholders 
are parallel
.
 
Such a system is quite achievable in gaming, but is by no means assured in all instances. 
For example, both the state and the casino operator have a stak
e in realizing an attractive return on 
investment. The state 
receives
 
tax revenue, among other benefits, while investors are rewarded for 
the risks they have undertaken. Similarly, both the public and private sectors have an abiding 
interest in promoting p
ublic confidence, and in maintaining high standards for integrity. Operators, 
who are often licensed in multiple jurisdictions, would not want to risk their gaming license in 
any
 
jurisdiction as that would put their licensure at risk in 
every
 
jurisdiction.
 
Where goals are not congruent, legislators and regulators would have an obligation to 

disparate interests into parallel goals. The most illustrative example of t
his phenomenon can be 
traced back to 1982, when a bank clerk from Toronto, Brian Molony, was regularly embezzling 
funds from his employer and gambling with those dollars at Caesars in Atlantic City.
 
The Molony case 

 
which was widely publicized and became 
the subject of both a 2002 
book, 
Stung: The Incredible Obsession of Brian Molony
, by 
Gary Ross
, 
and a 2003 movie
 
that was 
inspired by the events but changed the name of the chief subject
, 
Owning Mahowny
 

 
was viewed 
by many, including regulators, as a story of greed run amok. Gaming operators were willing to 
bend rules and not ask questions about a bank clerk clearl
y gambling over his head, and without 
paying any heed to issues ranging from the potential of pathological gambling to the issue of 
gambling with stolen funds.
 
The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the prosecutorial arm of the dual
-
agency regulato
ry structure in the state, negotiated a settlement with Caesars for various violations 
of regulations in the Molony matter, with the casino being required to close its doors 

 
while still 
paying its staff

152
 
 
1985.
357
 
The matter was summarized in 
The New York Times
 
following a decision by the quasi
-
judicial agency of the state to approve the settlement: 
 
The Casino Control Commission today ordered Caesars to close its Atlantic City casino 
for a day as a penalty for violating credit, deposit and reporting regulations to cater to a 
heavy gambler. The closing, the first ordered by the commission, could cost Caesars nearly 
$1 million in lost revenues. Thomas R. O'Brien, director of the New Jers
ey Division of 
Gaming Enforcement, said it was the harshest penalty to be imposed in the seven
-
year 
history of the Atlantic City gaming industry.
358
 
Nearly 30 years later, that penalty of shutting the casino down for a 
busy day
 
remains 
as 
one of 
the harshest
 
penalt
ies 
imposed by regulators in that state
 
(short of an outright license denial)
, 
and we are unaware of a similarly harsh penalty imposed in any other gaming jurisdiction.
 
Six months after that unprecedented closing, Caesars reached a settlement with C
anadian 

summary in the 
Philadelphia Inquirer
:
 
Molony was arrested April 27, 1982, a day after he lost $1 million gambling at Caesars. 
He got the gambling money by writ
ing loans in the names of both real and fictitious 
companies.
 
In court papers filed in Canada, Caesars said it never asked Molony for credit information 
and had never asked what he did for a living. The papers said Caesars supplied Molony 
with tens of thou
sands of dollars in hotel rooms and airfare by private Lear jet.
 
Although he plunked down thousands at the gaming tables, Molony led a modest lifestyle 
in Toronto, where he wore inexpensive, ill
-
fitting clothes and left carefully calculated 7 
percent tips 
in restaurants.
 
Court documents also show that Molony was able to transfer millions of dollars out of the 
Imperial Bank of Commerce through a company called California Clearing Corp., a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Desert Palace, a Las Vegas casino. The corp
oration's only purpose, 
according to records, was to let people deposit sums of money into a casino without 
detection.
 
As a result of Molony's activities at the casino, Caesars was forced to close for the day 
Nov. 30, the (Friday) after Thanksgiving, as a 
disciplinary measure for gambling
-
law 
violations. The closing was part of an agreement worked out between Caesars and the state 
Division of Gaming Enforcement.

The Casino Control Commission approved the agreement and $36,500 in fines against six

Industry analysts estimated that the casino stood to lose between $700,000 and $8

because of the shutdown.
359
 
The Molony case offers the highest profile, but was hardly alone
,
 
as an example of casinos 
having goals that were not parallel with 
the goals of the state in which they operated. In Atlantic 
City alone, the record includes numerous matters in which casinos ignored policies ranging from 
preventing underage gambling to minimizing problem gambling. Notably, such violations have 
declined i
n recent years. While it may very well be that regulatory oversight has diminished, thus 
leading to fewer violations being revealed, our experience suggests that much of the decline in 
violations can be attributed to goal congruence: Casinos are increasing
ly adapting their policies to 
be more fully aligned with the goals of the states in which they operate.

gaming statutes, regulations or policies should have a clear and legitimate purpose that can be 
readily communicated and understood. Indeed, while the perception of

Typically
, gaming regulation start

strict and then allow
s
 
for reforms as circumstances 
change, and as regulators become more comfortable with the processes involved in the governance 
of gaming. To move in the opposite direction 

 
moving from a relatively relaxed regulatory 
regimen to a more restrictive one 

 
would be difficult to implement 
practically and 
politically.
 
In 
large measure, the inherent difficulty in moving toward a more st
rict regulatory system if one is 
needed can be attributed to the relationship between gaming and politics. By its nature, gaming is 
inextricably intertwined with the political process

ence 

 
as well as its ability to generate profits 

 
depends on its ability to be in 
the good graces of elected and appointed officials, and to remain there
.
 
In understanding and in governing the relationship between the gaming industry and 
politics, certai
n trends and observations should be considered, based on our experience in other 
markets:
 

 
The ability of elected and appointed officials to shape and guide the policies that govern 
gaming, and that are designed to marshal the economic and social benefits o
f gaming, 
are at their zenith prior to the issuance of gaming licenses.

To whatever extent is reasonable and appropriate, steps should be taken to insulate 
gaming from politics, and to limit the ability of the gaming industry to directly influence 
the poli
tical process.
 

 
Over time, regulators and the regulated are likely to grow closer to each other. Left 
unchecked, a real risk exists that regulators can become cheerleaders for the industry 
they govern.
 
Much of this can be described as common sense, and as r
ecognition of reality. While public 
confidence in gaming demands that controls be put in place to restrict the ability of the industry to 
influence the political process, such controls are clearly limited, and gaming can never be fully 
insulated from polit
ics, or vice versa.
 

been identified that establish some level of insulation. These include:
 

 
Limiting, or eliminating, the ability of gaming licensees and their key e
mployees and 
qualifiers
360
 
from making political contributions at the state and/or local levels.
 

 
Appointing regulators to fixed terms that are not tied to the terms of the elected officials 
who make such appointments.
 

 
Establishing guidelines for regulators t
hat limit their ability to participate in the political 
process.
 

 
Limiting the ability of regulators to secure outside income.
 

 
Establishing strict post
-
employment restrictions for regulators and top staff that limit 
their ability to work for the industry th
ey govern once they leave public employment.
 
The presence of any or all of such policies can help establish and maintain public 
confidence and provide some level of independence for regulators, but true independence is clearly 
chimerical in established gam
ing jurisdictions. 
 
While we can identify benefits for the public and private sectors to share common goals, 
the shared goal of a successful gaming industry can turn regulators into cheerleaders. This risk was 
identified quite early in modern gaming regula
tion by the late Martin Danziger, one of the first 
appointed full
-
time members of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. 
In an interview 
conducted in 1982
,
361
 
Danziger observed a number of industries that had been regulated in the 
1970s, from securities t
o air transportation, and suggested that it is quite risky 

 
and that public

ers to individuals with the ability to 

license unless all of its qualifiers are deemed to be licensable as well.

Interview was conducted 
by Michael Pollock, researching his book, 
Hostage to Fortune: Atlantic City 
and Casino Gambling
, 1987. That portion of the interview was not directly cited in the book but is relevant for 
purposes of this analysis.

policy might suffer as a result 

 
if regulators get to the point where they are willing to overlook 
transgressions or endorse shortcuts as a means of advancing success.

362
 
The problem of balancing dual roles remains, and is arguably a permanent concern that 
will require a permanent balancing act. In gaming, the issue of dual mandates
 
spe
cifically translates 
into a risk of sending a message to licensees that revenue maximization is a primary goal, often at 
the expense of such other policies as addressing problem gambling, or of maintaining standards of 
character, honesty and integrity.
 
Thi
s risk is exacerbated and enhanced by another very real phenomenon in gaming 
regulation: Once a casino is licensed and operating, the ability 
of
 
regulators to change its course 
or, in the most extreme instance, remove its operating license is dramatically 
diminished. An 
operating casino is employing hundreds or, in many instances, thousands of employees and 
generating significant revenues for the state. This means that, on the very day it opens, a casino 
gains political stature, while the political will of 
regulators to enforce the rules declines.
 
This phenomenon is not uniform across states, and states have taken steps to address it
. 
In 
states in which the number of licenses is not fixed 

 
such as New Jersey, Mississippi or Nevada 
(which were the three earl
iest adopters of commercial gaming in the United States) 

 
the risk is 
less severe, as other gaming properties can open, or expand, to address any unmet market demand 
and increase employment.
 

 
in which an entity can 
purchase a casino prior to a full investigation and determination of suitability, based on the 
approval of regulators, by appointing a trustee entrusted with the preservation of the
 
assets of the 
gaming operator
. Such trustees 

 
oft
en retired judges, former casino gaming regulators, or other 
individuals who have the clear appearance of independence and integrity 

 
have no responsibilities 
or role in the operation of the casino whatsoever, unless the New Jersey Casino Control 
Commissi
on determines that the operator is not suitable for licensure.
 
At that point, a conservator is appointed, again usually a retired judge or government 
official, who assumes full control of the operation, including managing the property, with the goal 
of preparing the casino for sale to a third party. In the aforementio
ned case involving the license 
denial of the Tropicana, the trustee of the ICA was appointed to be the conservator. The

conservator has a fiduciary responsibility to obtain the highest and best price for the property, 
although the original owner 

 
the enti
ty deemed not suitable for licensure 

 
cannot be allowed to 
profit from such a sale. Any money paid for the property over and above the level of original 
investment goes to the state.
 
That process is far superior to one in which the state has limited abili
ties to fully distance 
an unsuitable owner from the operation. However, experience has shown that the concept of 
conservatorship can be less than perfect in practice.
 
A rare use of the conservatorship provision occurred in New Jersey in 2009, when the 
Comm
ission determined that the new 
owner
 
of the Tropicana was not fit for licensure. A pre
-
approved conservator 
immediately
 
took control of the property with the intent of readying it for 
sale, as r
e
quired by the ICA regulations.
 
The conservator
, however, 
rais
ed questions and criticism 
by the fees he charged for his services. As the 
Associated Press
 
reported at the time:
 
As many gamblers know, things can get expensive in a hurry in Atlantic City. 
 
The latest proof is the Tropicana Casino and Resort, where the 2
0
-
month effort to sell the 
business has racked up nearly $7.7 million in legal and consulting fees, with still more to 
come. 
 
On Wednesday, the state Casino Control Commission will consider additional bills totaling 
nearly $50,000. 
 
Those fees, some billed
 
at $970 an hour, are paid by the casino. They represent more than 
nine full days' winnings for the Tropicana, which is struggling to regain market share while 
threatening to lay off employees because of economic pressures. 
 
The Tropicana was sold last mon
th for $200 million to a group of investors led by 
billionaire Carl Icahn; the deal could close by year's end. When the casino
-
hotel first went 
on the market over a year and a half ago, it was expected to fetch about $1 billion. 
 
The mounting fees have pro
mpted casino regulators and state lawmakers to consider 
limiting the time and cost of similar efforts in the future. And with several distressed 
casinos struggling to survive, one or more additional gambling houses could find 
themselves 
going the way of th
e Tropicana.
363
 
The lesson here is that the best designed and crafted laws and regulations can still 
fail to 
meet expectations in practice. 
Perfection in gaming regulation will remain elusive, and no 
regulatory agency is immune from negative publicity, a dec
line in public confidence or, at worst, 
a scandal. The New Jersey Casino Control Commission endured a severe scandal of national 
proportions in its earliest years, when one of its first appointees was embroiled in the Abscam 
scandal, in which FBI agents es
tablished an elaborate scheme

The history of scandal and controversy in gaming regulation shows that agencies can 
survive, sometimes following dramatic step
s, and sometimes simply by appointing new people 
over time who fully understand the delicate relationship between maintaining public confidence 
and advancing public policy.
 
Gaming, and its regulatory oversight, has been guided by certain principles and rea
lities 
that we have observed in our work over the past several decades. 
In 2008, Spectrum wrote the 
following in a report for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts:
 
Our experience over the past decades has led us to develop certain cautionary notes to help 
ens
ure that expectations are realistic. While no two gaming markets can be precisely alike, 
there are some commonalities, including:
 

 
Gaming should never be viewed as a panacea to cure social ills or solve fiscal 
problems. It is a tool that, if effectively man
aged, can generate capital 
investment, employment and
 
visitation that in turn would provide resources that 
can help address a variety of other issues.
 

 
Casinos, by themselves, cannot turn unattractive or unappealing neighborhoods 
or communities into attract
ive magnets. To effect such a potential change often 
requires significant amounts of planning, financial capital and political capital.
 

 
Casinos, by themselves, cannot turn former industrial areas or other non
-
tourist 
sites into tourist attractions. That re
quires a concomitant investment in 
developing a necessary tourism infrastructure.
 

 
Neither the challenges nor the opportunities created by a casino industry stop at 
municipal or even state boundaries. 
 

 
The heart of the competitive bidding process will be the establishment of 
guidelines that delineate the criteria for evaluating bids. 
(The state)
 
needs to be 
as expansive and comprehensive as possible in its guidelines. 
 
In our experience in various market
s, including as participants and close observers in the 
30
-
year history of casino regulation in New Jersey, we note the following: 
 

 
A regulatory system should start out strictly, and then be modified as 
circumstances change, and as the regulators become mo
re comfortable and gain 
confidence that the process is moving in the right direction. In most cases, 
political and economic realities will be quickly established, making it difficult 
to move in the opposite direction, toward a system of stricter regulation
 
and 
tighter controls. This would be particularly true in this instance, where the

legislation contemplates a competitive bidding process. In such instances, the 
most important rules are the ones established at the outset to determine the 
successful bidder
s. Once those criteria have been established and a successful 
bidder has been named, the system would not allow lawmakers or regulators to 
go back and alter those initial criteria.
 

 
(Once)
 
a casino is established and is generating tax revenue, employing peo
ple 
and attracting visitors, it cannot be easily undone in any practical sense.
 

 
The public sector 

 
has broad discretion and powerful leverage at the outset to 
ensure that the successful bidder takes whatever steps are necessary to advance 
the public inter
est on a wide variety of fronts. Such leverage would be at its 
zenith during the pre
-
licensing phase, in which applicants would recognize that 
they must compete against each other in their zeal and in their creativity in 
developing strategies to advance th
e public interest. Once licenses are issued, 
and casinos are operational, we caution that such leverage would largely 
disappear.
 

 
Using that leverage to require that all bidders submit comprehensive, credible 
plans that are in congruence with public policie
s can be justified by the proposed 
legislation, which essentially creates 

 
regional monopolies. No other private 
businesses that targets consumer discretionary spending, from hotels to 
restaurants, could reasonably expect that 
(the state)
 
would protect th
em from 
potential in
-
state competition. We suggest that such protection requires a 
corresponding commitment to ensure that marketing, human resources and other 
policies put forth are designed to promote the public interest.
368

Conclusion
 
The modern history o
f efforts to establish effective gaming regulation 

 
beginning with the 
adoption of the New Jersey Casino Control Act in 1977 

 
parallels the interest of Wall Street in 
gaming as an investment opportunity. In our experience, that is no coincidence. An abse
nce of 
effective, stable regulation adds risk to investments, and risk translates into a higher cost of capital. 
The reverse is also true. Confidence lowers risk, which lowers the cost of capital 

 
a necessary 
ingredient for the development of a successful
 
gaming industry.
 
The ability of policymakers to push through changes and establish policies declines over 
time. With that in mind, policies can be established from the outset that are designed to ensure that 
both the state and the licensees share common g
oals.

1.
 

 
States choose to legalize gambling to raise revenue for public programs or for economic 
development, or 
for 
both. The amount the states collect from gambling revenues is a function of
 
several factors, including:
 

 

 

 
The types of gambling allowed and their availability to key population centers.
 

 
The tax rate on gambling revenue, or other fees and obligations.
 

 
The public policy 

 
or underlying purpose 
of 
why gambling was established. In Nevada, 
for example, the low casino
-
revenue tax rate has spawned the development of 
multibillion
-
dollar resorts, which in turn collect sales and lodging taxes that do not show 
up in gambling
-
specif
ic revenue reports
.
 
For data in this section, Spectrum relies on (and has the permission to use) reports by The 
Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the University at Albany (NY), which annually 
tracks state receipts from gambling. Its most such recent report, 
Bac

Gambling Revenues Rose in 2010

by Lucy Dadayan and Robert B. Ward, provides 
comprehensive data and analysis on this important subject.
 
For some states, gambling is an integral part of their fiscal health and hence their 
governments closely monitor the performance of their various gambling sectors 

 
and may help 
explain the economic need by some states to expand to either sustain or grow revenues. As noted 
later in this section, gambling receipts accounted for more than 5 
percent of own

revenue for five states in FY 2009.

Next, we rank
 
the states by total gambling receipts for FY 2010. The states with the highest 
gambling revenues do not necessarily generate the highest state tax receipts because their tax rates 
may be lower and/or they may have fewer types of legalized gambling. Nevada
 
generates more 

ranked only 10
th
 
best 

 
because it has the lowest casino

revenue tax in the country (6.75 percent) 
and because it has no lottery and no pari

Now we look at the US trend in state receipts from gambling, by sector, from FY 1998 
through 2010. Note in the following chart that receipts declined after the Great Recession began 
in 2007. The gambling industry had until that time proven to be resistant 
to economic downturns, 
but the two largest sectors 

 
casinos and lotteries 

 
experienced revenue declines coinciding with 
the recession. The racino industry was still very much 
undergoing widespread expansion
 
and thus 
remained in a growth mode
.
 
Regarding r
acino revenue, it is important to note that The Rockefeller 
Institute groups VLT revenue from racetracks with lottery revenues, impacting the classification 
of racino receipts from Delaware, New York, Rhode Island and West Virginia (and, going forward, 
Ohi
o). T
he pari
-
mutuel industry continued its long, steady decline, with state revenues
 
plunging 
from
 
$554 million in 1993 to
 
$150 million in 2010
.

2009 relied on gambling receipts for 12.5 percent of its own

Reliability of Gambling Revenues
 
As shown in Figure 
4
4
, legalized gambling generally provides a reliable revenue stream 
for 
governments,
 
on a 
holistic level
, 
except in times of severe recession. At the individual state 
level, however, gambling
-
revenue receipts
 
are
 
subject to rapid 

 
and sometimes dramatic 

 
declines when a neighboring state introduces a competing product that is within easy reac
h. This 
is most notable in 
Delaware and New Jersey
, where 
the introduction of competing casinos in 
neighboring states has
 
caused casino
-
tax receipts to decl
ine 
6
 
percent and 
45
 
percent, respectively
, 
from their peak collection years of 2011 and 2006, respe
ctively.
 
Nationally, i
n 2011 (the most recent period available for both sectors), commercial and 
Native American casinos 
(including VLT racinos, which in Figure 
4
1
 
are instead grouped as 
Lottery revenue) 
throughout 
the United States
 
generated $63.1 billion
 
of gross gaming revenue
.
 
This is depicted in the following 
chart
 
(the dotted line indicates overall linear trend in US gross 
gaming revenue).

year period (ended 2011), year

over
-
year growth occurred in eight of 
the 10
 
years, with the Great Recession causing revenue declines in 2008 and 2009. Th
e
 
breadth 
and depth of the recession 
effectively shattered the truism that casino gambling was recession
-
resistant
. T
otal growth in US gross gaming revenue (from 2002 to 2011) was 46 percent, or average 
annual growth of 4.3 percent. This growth was considerably greater than overall growth in 
the 
Consumer Price Index
371
 

 
which grew by 25 percent over the entire period, or average annual 
growth of 2.5 percent.
372
 
For 2012, 
as noted earlier, 
commercial casinos had gross gaming revenue of $37.3 billion, 
a 4.8 percent increase over 2011 figures.
373
 
Comparable data for Native American casinos will not 
be available until later this year; however, assuming there is no decrease in Native American 
gaming revenue (i.e.., 2012 vs. 2011) will equate to total US gross gaming revenue posting at least 
a 2.7 pe
rcent year

over

year increase 

 
marking the third consecutive year of revenue growth.

start of the aforementioned period), of the 15 states that

Direct and Indirect Costs to the State
 
The costs that legalized gambling may impose on stat
e and local g
overnments are both 
direct and indirect
. 
Direct costs, such as specific transportation infrastructure 
improvements or the 
costs of additional law enforcement officers, are easy to identify and quantify. Indirect costs 
are

Ascribing indirect costs to legalized gambling also presents another challenge. Where do you draw 
the line? Can anything that can even be remotely linked to gambling be consid
ered an indirect 
cost?
377
 
 
The 
proliferation of legalized gambling and the apparent strong public support for it may 
understandably lead one to 
believe that the social costs of
 
gambling exist within an acceptable 
range or are sufficiently 
offset by its 
benefits.
 
As recently as March 5, 2013, 
nearly 
62
 
percent
 
of 
the voters in Linn Cou
nty
,
 
I
A
, an economically vibrant
 
and 
white collar 
area, approved a new 
casino despite a strong opposition movement that emphasized the negative costs of gambling.
378
 
Currently
, all but two states, Hawaii and Utah, have some form of legalized gambling. However, 
opponents might argue that the proliferation of gambling is attributable to financially powerf
ul, 
politically influential pro
-
gambling forces 
that
 
have successfully defin
ed and manipulated public 
understanding of the issue.
 
According to the American Gaming Association, a 2013 poll found public acceptance of 
gambling to be at the highest level of the past decade. 
Some 85
 
percent 
of Americans 
view casino 
gambling as an accep
table activity for themselves or others. O
verall
 
acceptability is above 80
 
percent
 
for all age groups and is highest among younger individuals, those 
age 
21 to 39, and lowest, 
82
 
percent
, among those age 60 and over.
379
 
 
The national experience seems to indi
cate that while more accepting of legalized gambling, 
the public wants it to be contained within a strict regulatory framework. As the 1999 National 

permitted and which wil
l not; the number, location, and size of establishments allowed; the 
condition under which they operate; who may utilize them and under what conditions; who may

Many state and local governments are in a conflicted position when it comes to legalized 
gambling. They are often the beneficiaries of increased ta
x revenues, but they must also bear the 
financial burden of any social dysfunction caused by gambling. States that operate lotteries are 
actually gambling providers and maintain an exclusive monopoly on that service
. 
 
No responsible public official wants t
o harm h
is community. The challenge public officials
 
co
nfront is knowing what gambling
-
related course of action will produce desired results given 
strong and conflicting public opinion and data
.

notes that researchers 
fail to agree on the appropriate way to conceptualize and quantify how gambling may affect 
society. He identified the need for a st
andardized methodology for measuring the costs and benefits 
of legalized gambling and believes that public policy debate is hampered by the lack of such a 
model.

present cha
llenges. For example, if one community elects to commit considerable funds to battle 
problem gambling and another similar community does not, is it reasonable to assume that problem 
gambling is greater in the former community
?
383
  
 
According to Walker, it is
 
important to understand this distinction 
because
 
the level of 
government expenditures may not necessarily reflect the magnitude of a social problem
. 
Another 
aspect of this is that a well
-
funded, effective public program located in one community, may attra
ct 
clients from outside that community and thereby inflate the local extent of the problem
. 
A good 
example of this is services provided to homeless persons.
 
Economist Earl Grinols has written extensively on the benefits and costs of legalized 
gambling. Acc
ording to Grinols, t
he social costs of gambling 
mainly 
fall into nine
 
categories:
 
crime costs, business and employment
 
costs, bankruptcy, suicide, illness
 
related to pathological 
gambling, social
 
service costs, direct regulatory costs,
 
family costs, and 
abused dollars.

Crime 
 
Of the costs associated with legalized gambling, crime is usually a foremost governmental 

require the allocation of additional resourc
es that could offset the potential revenue benefits of

legalized gambling. Crime may also lower the quality of life in a given area, causing residents and 
businesses to leave and result in urban blight. Of all the arguments against legalized casino 
gamblin
g, the concern that casinos will bring more crime into a community is among the most 
common. On the other hand, casino gambling is believed by some advocates to help reduce crime 
by providing good employment opportunities and reducing poverty.
 
In 2005, Mar
yland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. issued a report to a legislative 

fiction to delude ourselves that it is possible to have casinos without more crime
. 
Ca
sinos would

The types of crime he cited included violent 
crimes, crimes against property, insurance fraud,
 
juvenile crime, drug and alcohol related crime, 
domestic violence and child abuse

These cr

organized crime elements.

According to Curran, this increased crime would

When the Massachusetts legislature was considering a casino proposal in 2008, the 
Massachusetts Distr
ict Attorneys Association was 
more reserved and less strident
. 
The group took
 
no
 
official position on the issue but made available a fact sheet that quoted a state legislative 

 
gambling expansion is likely to bring an attendant 
increase in crime volume, as is consistent with increases in vis

developments across the country. There is no evidence conclusively pointing to an increase in

The 1999 National Gambling Impact Study Commission took a similar position when 
exami
ning the relationship between
 
crime and gambling
. Due to inconsistencies in the types of 
crimes studied, the Commission noted that it was not surprising that the proponents of both views 
are able to advance research to support their views. Therefore, the 
C
ommission
 
found the 
reliability of such studies questionable

In a 2005 study published in 
The Review
 
of Economics and Statistics
, Grinols and Mustard 
examine
d
 
the relationship between casinos and crime using
 
county
-
level data for the United States 
between 1977 and 1996. 
Their sample covered
 
all 3,165 
US
 
counties
 
and focused on the seven 
FBI indexed crime
s:
 
aggravated assault, rape,
 
robbery, murder, larceny, burglary, and auto theft.
 
They found that m
ost factors that reduce crime
 
occur before 
or shortly after a casino opens. T
hose 
that increase
 
crime, 
such as 
problem and pathological gambling, occur over 
time. The
 
concluded 
that the e
ffect on crime is l
ow shortly after a casino opens and 
escalates over time.
391
 
Although 
Grinols and Mustard considered their study to be one of the most comprehensive in terms of the 
counties covered and the variables used, it w
as not without its critics.
 
Walker faulted the Grinols and Mustard study for not adequately addressing the issue of 

Their results are
 
invalid because of a variety of serious problems in their data and 
analysis.
 
The authors simply compared casin
o to non
-
casino counties. But they did
 
not control for 
the volume of tourists, so the crime effect they found may
 
have been caused by tourism generally 
rather than casino tourism
 
specifically. To show a valid link between crime and casinos, the authors
 
wou
ld have needed to compare casino counties to other counties with non
-
casino
 
tourism.

392
 
Walker believes that since 
few, if any, of the researchers 
Grinols and Mustard cite a
cknowledge 
this issue or account for it
, 
the result is 
an overstatement of the
 
socia
l costs of casino gambling on 
government and society.
393
 
In a 2011 study, 
Grinols
, Mustard and 
Staha
 
studied the issue of how the type of visitors 
may affect crime. In an exhaustive study that analyzed
 
data on National Park visitors between 1979 
and 1998
 
in 
every county in 
the United States
,
 
they concluded that the type of visitor and the nature 
of the attraction have significantly different effects on crime rates.
394
 
Obviously, conflicting studies and interpretations of data present a huge challenge to state 
a
nd local policy makers attempting to accurately gauge how casino gambling related crime might

affect their communities
. 
Another complication in analyzing the crime related costs of legalized 
gambling is that costs are often dispersed among various levels o
f government 

 
federal, state, 
county and municipal. For example, the costs of criminal investigations and prosecution may be 
borne by county government and the costs of imprisonment by the state.
 
b.
 
Public Health
 
Public health is another area in which state 
and local governments are both directly and 
indirectly impacted by legalized gambling. The World Health Organization, which established 
standardized definitions 
f
or community health care

The state of 
complete physical, mental,
 
and social well
-
being and 
not merely the absence of disease or 
infirmity
.

395
 
Advocates of casino gambling often cite its potential to improve the overall wellness 
of the community in many ways. Chief among these is the potential to create employment with 
t
angible benefits such as good incomes, adequate health insurance, and access to quality health 
care. Such positive outcomes would improve the quality of life, vitality and overall well
-
being of 
a community. 
 
 
Opponents are quick to point out that negative 
community health impacts may also 
accompany the advent of legalized gambling. Many of these would be related to pathological and 
problem gambling, which have been associated with unhealthful behaviors and outcomes such as 
drug and alcohol abuse, 
nicotine d
ependence, depres
sion and insomnia. It has also been associated 
with 
higher rates of child abuse and neglect, domestic 
violence, unsafe sex and family break up. 

 
 
How 
effective the response to a public problem will be depends on how accurately the 
problem is understood
. 
Addressing the challenge of problem and pathological gambling is difficult 
since an individual may be plagued by other pre
-
existing disorders such a
s
 
dr
ug and alcohol abuse 
or mental illness. Again, the question of causation must be addressed
. 
Simply because certain types 
of behaviors are associated with gambling does not necessarily mean that gambling caused them
. 
This condition is known as co
-
morbidity.
 
Co
-
morbidity was cited as a consideration by the 1999 National Gambling Impact study 
Commission
. 

psychological problems, including substance abuse, mood disorders, and personality dis
orders
. 
The joint occurrence of two or more problems 

 
termed co
-
morbidity
 

 
is an important, though 
complicating factor in studying this disorder. Is problem or pathological gambling a unique

pathology that exists on its own or is it merely a symptom of a
 
common predisposition, genetic or 

396
 

If gambling were not an option, a person who is predisposed 
to a
 
pathological disorder may manifest his disorder in other unhealthy ways.
 
Many pa
thological 
gamblers have other behavioral disorders
. 

 
If
 
pathological
 
gambling is simply a symptom of 
some more basic disorder, then, it is the
 
more basic disorder rather than gambling itself that is the 
underlying cause
 
of the adverse consequences and so
cial costs of the pathological gambling.

397
 
He notes that according to the 
DSM
-
IV
 
criteria, 
a person
 
coping with b
ipolar disorder, who may 
meet 
all of the criteria for pathological gambling
,
 
is not considered a
 
p
athological gambler if the 
individual
 
also me
ets the criteria for a Manic
 
Episode, and the Manic Episode is responsible for 
excessive gambling
.
398
 
Similar questions arise if an individual is both an alcoholic and a compulsive gambler who 
abuses and neglects his family. To what extent is his alcoholism 
responsible for the harm and 
distress he causes his wife and children as opposed to his compulsive gambling? 
 
The data do suggest that individuals who are afflicted with these sorts of behavioral 
disorders may be more inclined to problem gambling. However,
 
even if opportunities to gamble 
were not readily available, government would still need to cope with the various manifestations of 
these other problems. The failure of policy makers to take co
-
morbidity into account may lead one 
to overstate the negative 
impacts of legalized gambling and lead to sub optimal government 
policies and programs designed to respond to those impacts.
 
How to manage any negative health impacts of gambling is clearly a concern to many state 
and local officials. As with crime, they w
ill find little definitive guidance in the literature, which 
is often conflicting and ambiguous
.
 
Framing the problem with adequate precision to shape and 
enable an effective public policy response may be difficult
. 
 
A further complication is that what is o
ften perceived as benefit of casino gambling may 
have some inherent ne
gative health aspects as well. 
For instance, family sustaina
ble employment 
is good, but employment
 
in 
a 
casino can expose 
workers to long
 
periods of second
-
hand smoke
, 
of which the adver
se health effects are well known.
399
 
Shift workers and those required to work 
long hours 
can experience considerable disruption
s
 
of
 
family and social activities since 
many of 
these are 
day 
or
iented. Weekend work schedules 
can 
impede 
involvement in 
family 
sporting
 
events 
or religious activities and diminish supportive social connections with those whose daily schedules

assist with child care, shopping and housework

Many of the

negative aspects may be 
ameliorated by a better understand

in the

400
 
It is critical that state and local governments considering or already affected by legalized 
gambling evaluate and u
nderstand all its potential aspects. Many communities impacted by 
legalized gambling respond to public health concerns by conducting a community health impact 
assessment (

HIA

)
.
 
A
n HIA is 
an information
al tool designed and implemented by the local 
communi
ty to enable 
decision
-
makers 
to 
consider the health implications of pro
posed policies, 
especially policies that do not 
appear to have 
a 
direct 
health connection. It has three 
core functions: 
assessment, policy development and assurance.
401
 
 
An excellent exam
ple of a HIA for a community considering legalized gambling is the 
Kansas HIA Project.
402
 
It was conducted by the Kansas Health Institute, and funded in part with 
grants from the Health Impact Project, a collaborative effort by the Robert Wood Johnson 
Founda
tion and the Pew Charitable Trusts
. 
The Kansas HIA Project 
thoroughly e
xamined how the 
presence of a 
local 
casino 
could 
affect health, both positive
ly and negatively. It examined 
potential 
risks, such
 
as second
-
hand smoke
 
exposure
, traff
ic accidents, probl
em and pathological gambling
, 
divorce
 
a
nd suicide. It also analyzed
 
potential community benefits, such as job creation,
 
increased 
tourism, 
increased 
state and local revenue
s
, and health insurance. 
The goal of the assessment was 
to bring all 
health
 
implications 
up for informed consideration and debate. The Kansas HIA believe 
they succeeded in that goal.
403
 
c.
 
Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure
 
There are several pathways through which casino gambling may imp
act the state and local 
government
 
transpo
rtation infrastructure. 
The roadway system need
ed
 
to support 
increased leve
ls 
of traffic may already be old, at capacity, or inadequately designed to acc
ommodate new traffic 
patterns. The cost to bring the infrastructure up to requisite
 
standards can be 
hu
ndreds of million
s 
of dollars. 
Impacts may also extend to public
 
transportation. State and local governments may see 
train, bus or subway traffic increase to uncomfortable levels on certain routes requiring that they

increase service levels. They may also 
feel pressure to establish unprofitable routes in order to 
transport workers who might otherwise be unable to get to work
. 
 
 
In many cases
,
 
a casino developer may agree to share some of the estimated costs of 
improvement 
or public transportation service 
as
 
part of his approval process
. 
In other cases
,
 
government may assume 
a portion of 
these costs in order 
to 
get

other economic benefits
. 
 
In New Jersey
 
in the mid
-
1990s
, under Governor Christie Whitman, the state agreed to 
fun
d $275 million in major roadway improvement
s
 
to facilitate the development of 
a 
new casino 
resort proposed by 
Mirage Resorts and its CEO, 
Steve Wynn. 
It is currently the site of the 
Borgata 
Casino Hotel & Spa
 
in Atlantic City. 
Donald Trump, who owned a cas
ino on an adj
acent
 
property, 
strong
ly fought against the 
proposal.
404
 
He withdrew his opposition after the state included in the 
plan 
an 
access improvement to 
one of the
 
casino
s his company operated at the time
.
 
One of the more immediate impacts state and lo
cal government may feel upon opening a 
new gaming facility is an increase in traffic on local roadways. The degree of the impact is subject 
to many of the aforementioned variables as well as the scale and location of the new facility. 
Sometimes, the impact
s of traffic are felt regionally, in nearby communities that may have had no 
say in the development process
. 
Connecticut was one of the first states to have Indian gaming, as 
it was fo
rced upon it by a federal court decision. It can serve as an important e
xample for two 
reasons. It demonstrates how the impact of a casino can transcend municipal boundaries and it 
shows how the lack of good regional planning can exacerbate their more challenging impacts. 
 
Concerns regarding the impact of traffic were substant
iated in an impact study Spectrum 
did for the State of Connecticut in 2009.

T
he impact of 
non

disorderly persons, lost

and dispute resolutions?
 
Within the first year after the Horseshoe Casino Cleveland opened in Ohio, the city 
incurred $3.1 million in additional expenses related to the police department larg
ely due to 
increased visitors and activity in its downtown area.

According to the 
Maryland Gazette,
 
the 
creation of a special county police unit for the area was 
necessary
 
to keep a lid on problems
 
in
 
the 
vicinity of the new Maryland Live Casino in Hanove
r. 
 

he City of Norwich 
felt 
significant impacts from Indian gaming casinos eight miles away. 
City officials estimate
d
 
casino
-
related costs to be anywhere from $1 million to $2.5 million a year. They 
include: A 27 percent 
increase in motor vehicle accidents from 1991 to 2004. An increase in police overtime from 
$85,000 in 1991 to more than $280,000 in 2008. A 76 percent increase in calls for
 
service from 
people needing police 
from 1992 to 2004.
408
 
In som
e communities, local police and fire department
s
 
may be required to purchase 
additional equipment and provide specialized training for their workers.
 
Government may reduce 
these costs by requiring gambling establishments to 
share the costs. To minimize the
 
impact on 
local police, gambling establishments may be required to 
maintain certain levels of in house 
se
curity personnel or establish
 
a fee for service arrangement 
to cover 
when additio
nal police 
service
 
may be desired or required. Governments may impose
 
additional tax assessments 
on 
gambling establishments to offset additional law enforcement costs.

Driving Under the Influence
 
Do casinos increase the number of drunk drivers on local roads?
 
Earlier in this report, we 
noted that destination resorts can increase demands on law enforcement, a subject we will explore 
in more detail here. 
Casinos are k
nown for their fast
-
paced environments where customers are 
encouraged to let loose and have a goo
d time
. 
This often means enjoying alcoholic beverages that 
may be provided complementarily to the customer while gambling or enjoyed at a casino lounge 
or restaurant. The anecdotal evidence would indicate a connection between an increase in drunk 
drivers a
nd casinos

In 2009,

had
 
more than doubled since 1992. 
The towns of Montville and Ledyard
 
also experienced 
significant increases. Roughly 20 percent of the motorists in Montville, Ledyard and North

In what is considered one of the first empirical studies on the subjec
t, 
Chad
 
D. Cotti and 
Douglas M. Walker explored 
whether there is a link between casino expansion and alcohol
-
related
 
fatal traffic accidents.
 
They found 
that in urban areas, casinos actually reduce the rate of DUIs, 
while the rate for suburban and ru
ral ar
eas increases. The
y
 
believe the difference may be that in 
urban areas the shorter 
driving distance
s
, availability of public transportation, and substitution of 
gambling for bar
-
hopping 
might 
account for the dec
reased rate, while the rate increase in less 
p
opulated areas
 
is caused by the increase in distance driven by alcohol
-
impaired drivers.

There are several ways in which governments respond to the problem of intoxicated 
driving
. 
Public education campaigns can make people more aware of the dangers of dru
nk driving 
and the severe penalties for it. Strict enforcement and police tactics such as drunk driving check 
points are also effective
. 
Ensuring that the proprietors of establishments that serve alcoholic 
beverage properly train their staff on how to dete
ct and handle intoxicated patrons is also necessary 
to reduce the problem.
 
f.
 
Social Service Costs
 
Legalized gambling is believed to impose higher costs on governments by attracting more 
people to the area who may sooner or later need assistance from governme
nt programs. These 
individuals may have come as patrons of the gaming facility or in search of work. The energy and 
24
-
hour activity attendant with casino
s
 
is a special attraction for the homeless or otherwise 
financially destitute. It offers opportunities
 
to panhandle and to seek temporary respite and 
accommodation in the public areas of facilities that may be open 
24 hours
 
daily.
 
A survey conducted by the International Union of Gospel Missions 
found what they called 

compelling evidence of a link between 
gambling and homelessness.

adversely impacted by, a gambling facility may impose additional public costs for psychiatric and

shelter operations, traveler

risdiction
s
 
address the impact on schools by requiring that a portion of casino 
revenues be dedicated to education. In 2009, 
Ohio voters amended the state constitution to allow 
casinos in Cleveland, Toledo, Columbus and Cincinnati. The state levies a 33 pe
rcent tax on 
adjusted gross g
ambling revenue
. 
School districts in Ohio will share 34 percent of that tax 
revenue

still desirable, would be too small to have any meaningfu

Workforce Training
 
The workforce required by a new gambling establishment may vary depending on its size, 
nature and amenities. Casino development may spur other nearby development and create even 
more employment opportunities. To the extent tha
t the local latent workforce may adequately 
possess the skills and training necessary meet the new demand, the project can be easily assimilated 
into the community with little or no governmental assistance. If the local workforce is inadequate, 
then traini
ng and importation of workers may be necessary
. 
 
A report to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission estimates
 
the cost of developing and 
training a workforce for its new
 
casino industry at $9 million dollars.
418
 
Responsibility for 
workforce training usually com
es under the local Workforce Investment Board. These entities 
were established throughout the United States by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Their 
role is to coordinate and direct state, local and federal funding into appropriate employment 
trainin
g programs.

Conclusion
 
Gambling is a reliable and predictable funding source for governments, except in times of 
pronounced recession and when competition arises in neighboring states.
 
Five states in FY 2010 
relied on gambling receipts for more than 5 per
cent of their own
-
source state budget revenue.
 
Gambling, however, costs governments in both direct and indirect ways in such areas as 
crime, public health, infrastructure, law enforcement and emergency services, social services, 
schools (in those areas wit
h large, high
-
employment casinos) and workforce training.
 
Whether the 
economic benefits brought by gambling receipts outweigh its economic and social costs has been 
the subject of considerable research 

 
and considerable debate.

Impacts of Gambling: 
Social, Criminal, Personal, Fiscal
 
A general description of gambling impacts, including: Social, criminal, and personal; short
-
 
and long
-
term 
fiscal.
 
Legalized gambling can affect society in a variety of different ways, positive and negative. 
Among the mos
t common forms of legalized gambling, including lottery, pari
-
mutuels such as 
horse and greyhound racing, and casinos, the spread of legal commercial casinos has generated the 
most interest, concern, and debate during the past two decades. Indeed, the intr
oduction of casinos 
has been a controversial subject in Florida for years; as a result, the State endeavored to study 
casinos back in 1995.
419
 
In this section, we provide a general description of impacts from gambling, including 
moral/ethical concerns; socia
l, criminal, and personal impacts; as well as long
-
 
and short
-
term 
effects of casinos development. As commercial casinos are the most controversial form of 
gambling expansion currently being considered in Florida, our analysis focuses on the literature 
and
 
evidence on the impacts of casinos.
 
The economic and social impacts of legalized gambling have been widely written about 
and studied. Studies generally focus on the effects of gambling as they relate to quantifiable metrics 
such as employment, crime, tax 
revenues, and problem gambling. Analyzed less are
 
impacts that 
are somewhat subjective and not readily quantifiable.

Moral and Ethical I
ssues
 
Some people oppose gambling in all its forms, such as lotteries, race tracks, and casino
s. 
According to a May 2013
 
Gallu
p Poll survey, 64
 
percent
 
of Americans find gambling morally

From these results one may infer that 36

Irving Kristol, a Professor of Urban Values at New York University, articulated this point 
of view at a time when legalized gambling was just beginning its national proliferation in America. 
In 1974, he wrote an op
-
ed piece for 
The Wall Street Journal
 
oppo
sing the spread of legalized 
gambling. At the time, a movement to legalize gambling was underway in New Jersey. Kristol 


ermined classical social virtues such as moderation, self
-
reliance, self
-
discipline, thrift, and diligence. At the same time, it encouraged classical vices such 
as extravagance, avarice and the lack of social responsibility.
421
 
Kristol believed that state 
su
pported gambling was antithetical to a capitalist society. It subverted the values capitalism 
needed to thrive.
 
The same year that Kristol wrote his op
-
ed, Congress established the first Commission on 
the Review of National Policy Toward Gambling. The purp
ose of the Commission was to study 
all aspects of gambling that existed in America at the time and to develop recommendations for 
the states to follow when establishing policies. In its final report, the Commission began with a

It also fostered a desired to achieve wealth without work. It distracted one 
from pursuing 
activities that brought one closer to God.
 
As public acceptance of gambling as a leisure activity increased, arguments based on its 
moral costs lost ground. According to 
the 
Rev. Tom Grey, spokesman for the National Coalition 
Against Legalize
d Gambling, church opposition to gambling has not been widely effective. Grey, 
who railed against gambling for years as a United Methodist pastor, said the argument that 
gambling is sinful does not adequately counter strong public unwillingness to restrict
 
certain 
personal freedoms. Consequently, Grey's anti
-
gambling coalition now avoids explicit mentions of 
religion, and presents more economically based arguments that focus on addiction, bankruptcy and 
crime.

Focus on the Family, a politically influenti

and strengthening families, strongly opposes all forms of legalized gambling. In their official 

activity is 
morally bankrupt from its very foundation. Gambling is also an activity which exploits 
the vulnerable 

 
the young, the old and those susceptible to addictive behaviors. Further, gambling 
entices the financially disadvantaged classes with the unrealistic ho
pe of escape from poverty 



428
 
In Florida, the
 
Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist 
Convention has been a leading voice in warning about the effects of widespread gambling. The 
commission notes on its website:
 
Among the arguments advanced to justify gambling is the one which
 
says that all of life is 
a gamble or a risk. But risk
-
taking in gambling is different from the risks involved in the 
normal routine of life. The risks in gambling are artificially created. In other ventures, the 
risk is part of the creative process. For e
xample, the contractor risks labor and capital to

It is also argued that so
me people like to spend their recreation money betting on horses or 
playing slot machines, just as others prefer to spend theirs for a round of golf or a movie. 
Gambling obviously provides a kind of recreational excitement for some, but the cost to 
individ
uals, families, the economy, and society is too high to justify it. 
 
Seen in this light, gambling is personally selfish, morally irresponsible, and socially 
destructive. Therefore, gambling must be vigorously resisted. Such resistance requires an 
understan
ding of the problem, a workable plan of attack, and a personal commitment to 
work against gambling. 
 
The gambling problem results from two interrelated factors: (1) Many people have a desire, 
often a compulsion, to gamble. (2) Most of these people have acc
ess to gambling 
opportunities. The ultimate goal of a plan of action is to control the desire to gamble and 
eliminate the access to gambling opportunities. 
 
When the desire to get something for nothing and the opportunity to gamble go hand in 
hand, resista
nce to one requires resistance to the other. To attempt to eliminate the desire 
without abolishing the opportunity is to invite failure. It is a matter of record that as 
gambling becomes more accessible, more people gamble. Thus, legalization is not the 
an
swer to the gambling problem. Instead, it is one primary cause of the gambling problem. 
 
Any adequate plan to deal with gambling must be both extensive and comprehensive. It 
must be extensive enough to include the spiritual, educational, and legal approach
es. It 
must be comprehensive enough to incorporate the family, the world of work, community 
clubs and organizatio
ns, the church, and government.
429
 
Moral opposition against gambling is not limited to the Christian community. In Maryland, 
both the Baltimore 
Jewish Council and the Baltimore Board of Rabbis officially came out against 
expanded gambling.
 
Rabbi Gila Ruskin of the Harford Jewish Center and first vice president of 
the Baltimore Board of Rabbis stated she believes expanded gambling preys on the weak
 
and 

name of raising money for causes like education. But what do you tell those kids about where the 
money for their school came from? That we raised the funds by

Notably, the successful 1976 campaign to legalize casinos in Atlantic City, NJ included

school in the Atlantic City region were used in
 
radio advertisements that claimed morality was on 


432
 
In sum, mo
rality has historically been a factor in shaping public policy. Capital 
punishment, pornography and gay marriage are some examples where much weight is placed on 
moral perceptions and concerns when shaping policy. It is a challenging factor since it may be
 

from one community to another, as well as over time. 
 
2.
 
Opportunity C
osts
 
In economics, an opportunity cost is defined as the cost incurred in forgoing the ben
efits 
of one course of action while pursuing the benefits of another. For example, one might decide to 
take a job right out of high school rather than go to college. In the short term, one reaps the benefits 
of not paying tuition costs and losing four year

pay the cost of earning less income
 
over 
a period of many working years
.
 
Those opposed to legalized gambling sometimes argue that it is pursued as an economic 
development policy because it
 
i
s easier and i
ts financial benefits are more immediate. However, 
they argue that those benefits are offset by its social costs and may not be sustainable in the long 
term. According to opponents, while casino gambling might make local sense, especially in 
financially di
stressed communities that have few, if any, viable alternatives, the collective long 
term costs of its proliferation are significant and have a national impact. Thousands of workers 
and billions of dollars in capital are directed into investments that, the
y argue, do little to increase 

. 
Casino opponents 
argue that casinos invest little, if anything, 
to 
improve worker skills and training and capital could 
arguably
 
be
 
better invested 
in more productive industries.
 
The problem with assessing opportunity costs is that knowing the outcome of any course 
of action with any degree of certainty is not possible. A high
-
tech startup company may fail and

Social, Criminal, Personal Impacts
 
a.
 
Negative Impacts
 
We now turn to a discussion of specific negative impacts that are ofte
n thought to 
accompany legalized gambling. The goal in this section is to provide a brief review of those 
impacts that have been studied and quantified in the academic literature.
 
Disordered Gamblers
 
Most of the negative socioeconomic impacts often associa
ted with gambling, and casino 

are people who gamble to an extent beyond recreational gambling such that it disrupts their career 
and/or personal/professional re
lationships.
433
 
Psychologists estimate the prevalence rate of 
disordered gamblers to be between 0.4
 
percent and
 
2.0
 
percent
 
of the general population.
434
,
 
435
 
 
However, prevalence rates may be greater or lower in areas. In discussing this issue with 
representatives from the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling (

FCCG

), it appears that the 
prevalence rate could be significantly higher, depending on where one attempts to identify problem 
gamblers. The 0.4
 
percent 

 
2.0
 
percent
 
rate is based on the ps
ychology literature, much of which 
is based on clinical diagnoses of problem gamblers. However, as noted
 
by Laura Letson at the 


see a much higher prevalence rat
e if the diagnosis was attempted at non
-

that

analysis, based on a preliminary

of the arrestee population, the prevalence rate may be over 15
 
percent
. Other FCCG data indicate 
that prevalence rates for adults and adolescents may be in the same range (15
 
percent
 
to 18 
percent
).
436
 
Disordered gambling is a condition which is usually
 
diagnosed in a clinical setting. The 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
(

DSM

), published by the American Psychiatric Association, 
is the standard for the diagnosis of problem/disordered gambling. The DSM
-
IV (1994; 2000) lists

Disordered 
Gambling and the Proximity of Casinos
 
One important question for any government jurisdiction considering the expansion of 
legalized casinos is whether the prevalence of disordered gambling is related to the proximity of 
casinos. In other words, is the intr
oduction of casinos to an area likely to increase the prevalence 
of disordered gambling? Several studies have examined this issue. While the odds of a person 
being a disordered gambler are about 1
 
percent
, for people within 10 miles of a casino the odds

crease by 90
 
percent
 
(to 1.9
 
percent
), according to one study.
439
 
However, it is unclear whether 
an increase in this risk is the result of new people in that area developing gambling problems, or 
whether a casino attracts existing disordered gamblers to the 
area. Another study on adolescents 
found that the number of different forms of legal gambling in a state is related to an increase
 
in
 
the 
proportion of problem gamblers in the state.
440
 
 
Hence, the evidence suggests that the negative impacts from casinos tha
t are associated 
with disordered gambling would likely be worse in Florida if casino gambling is expanded there. 
Indeed, r
epresentatives from the F
CCG
 
indicate that, since 2005, help
-
line calls in the state have 
increased over 50
 
percent
. This is during a 
time period in which the amount and types of legalized 
gambling increased dramatically in the state

441
 
At the
 
same time, however, psychologists have not found significant differences in 
prevalence rates across jurisdictions or across time. So, even though casinos have spread across 
the United States, the prevalence of disordered gambling has not increased at the 
same rate. Since 
Florida already has several legal types of gambling, including tribal casinos, it is unclear how the 
introduction of commercial casinos would affect the prevalence of problem gambling. But if help
-
line call data are an indication, gambling
 
problems would likely increase with expanded gambling 
in Florida.
 
Negative Social Impacts Associated with Casinos (and Gambling
)
 
Social scientists have been studying the economic and social impacts of legalized 
gambling, particularly casino gambling, sinc
e the early 1990s. Such research was frequently cited 
in debate over the expansion of casinos into new states, especially when the research offered a 

of resea

189
 
 
Among 
the many studies that examine the negative social impacts that are often associated 
with gambling in general, and casino gambling in particular, the paper by Thompson, Gazel, and 
Rickman represents one of the most careful analyses.
443
 
These authors surveyed 
Gamblers 
Anonymous members, people who might be expected to be more likely than the general public to 
be diagnosed as disordered gamblers. Based on the survey responses, Thompson et al. estimate the 
annual social costs per disordered gambler to be around $
9,500. This amount includes the 
following types of social cost: employment (including lost work hours, unemployment 
compensation, and lost productivity and unemployment; $2,941), bad debts ($1,487), civil court 
($848), criminal justice (including thefts, a
rrests and trials, and incarceration; $3,498), therapy 
($361), and welfare ($334).
 
There is no doubt that disordered gamblers sometimes engage in socially costly behaviors. 
However, such monetary social cost estimates have been criticized in the literature
.
444
 
One of the 
key problems with estimating the monetary value of social costs is that most disordered gamblers 
also have other behavioral problems, such as alcohol or drug use problems.
445
 
Yet, most social 
cost studies simply attribute all of the social cost
s created by these individuals to the gambling 
problem. There is no research 
that 
successfully partitions the costs among the various behavior 
problems experienced by the individual.
446
 
 
While it is not possible to offer an objective social cost monetary est
imate without making 
a variety of arbitrary assumptions, it is informative to discuss the different types of problems that 
are most commonly associated with disordered gambling. In other words, a qualitative, rather than 
quantitative, discussion of social 
costs is more useful.
 
Casinos and Crime Rates
 
One of the most common concerns people have with the expansion of gambling is that it 
may cause an increase in crime rates. Such concerns are often voiced by members of the law 
enforcement community. For exampl

indicates that she believes there is a link between gambling and crime. Her organization is opposed 
to any expansion of gambling in Florida because of concerns that crime problems would be 
exacerbated.

crime, depending on the types of gambling available and other characteristics of the community in 
question. 
 
Over the past three decades numerous researchers have examined the 
relationship between 
casino gambling and crime rates. One of the most commonly cited studies is the 2006 study by 
Grinols and Mustard.
448
 
These authors examined county
-
level crime data from 1977 through 1996. 
As do most studies on the subject, Grinols and Mu

Uniform Crime Reports
 

burglary, and auto theft. They argue that approximately 8
 
percent
 
of casino county crime can be 
attributed to 
the existence of casinos. Several studies confirm the Grinols and Mustard results; yet 
others find no relationship between casinos and crime rates.
 
Although the Grinols and Mustard paper received a lot of attention, it has also received a 
significant amoun
t of criticism because the authors calculated the crime rate in a way which 
overstates the impact of casinos. Crime rates should reflect the risk of an individual being 
victimized by crime.
449
 
In a county with no tourism, for example, calculating the crime r
ate is 
simple; it is the number of crimes committed divided by the population at risk (or county residents). 
But if there is 
significant
 
tourism in a county, then the crime rate should be calculated as the total 
number of crimes committed divided by county
 
residents plus tourists. Since Grinols and Mustard 
divided crimes by county population only 

 
and excluded tourists from their population measure 

 
their calculations almost certainly overstate the effect of casinos on crime. 
 
The 2010 study by Reece
450
 
sig
nificantly improved on the Grinols and Mustard study, as 
Reece controlled for the number of tourists and also the number of casino customers 

 
two critical 
adjustments 
absent
 

thorough
 
than the Grinols and Mustard analysis, he examined only Indiana. Nevertheless, his 
findings are an important contribution to the overall understanding of casinos and crime. In 
summary, Reece finds that burglaries increase in a county a few years after a c
asino opens. 
However, car thefts and aggravated assaults decreased. Increased casino volume reduces larceny, 
car theft, aggravated assault, and robbery.
451
  
 
A recent, fairly comprehensive review of the casino
-
crime literature shows that almost all 
studies that find a relationship between casinos and crime calculate the crime rate by excluding the 
tourists from the population at risk. Those studies that do incl
ude the tourists in the population

measure find no casino effect on crime rates.
452
 
Given the best available evidence, it seems unlikely 
that the existence of casinos causes an increase in crime rates, properly calculated. There 
may be 
a relationship between casinos and crime, but there is no good evidence, as yet, to support such 
claims. 
 
Problem Gambling and Crime
 
There
 
is solid evidence that disordered gamblers are more likely than non
-
gamblers to 
engage in crime. This connection make
s intuitive sense. For example, a person who has difficulty 
controlling his gambling may have to take drastic actions to obtain money to satisfy a gambling 
habit. A variety of studies that rely on Gamblers Anonymous members confirm that these 
individuals a
re more likely to commit crimes. For example, the study by Meyer and Stadler finds 
that 89
 
percent
 
of their sample of pathological gamblers admitted to having committed at least one 
crime in their lifetime.
453
 
This rate is much higher than for the general po
pulation.
 
Even when analyzing a sample of people from the general population, the link between 
gambling behaviors and crime seems to exist. In one study of adolescents, researchers found that 
individuals who indicated gambling behaviors consistent with tho
se from the DSM were 
significantly more likely to indicate that they had also engaged in crime, compared to individuals 
who did not exhibit disordered gambling behaviors.
454
 
However, the study also found that it was 
not
 
casino gambling that is
 
most
 
linked to
 
crime
 

 
r
ather
, it was
 
gambling on horse racing, sporting 
events, and card games 
that 
were found to have the link to crime. 
 
It is difficult to predict whether or not the increased crime committed by disordered 
gamblers has a meaningful impact on overall 
crime rates, since disordered gamblers make up such 
a small portion of the population. Aside from that, as noted above, results from crime rate studies 
are inconclusive as a group. Nevertheless, the literature seems to confirm that problem gamblers 
are mor
e likely to engage in crimes than non
-
problem gamblers. 
 
Casinos and White
-
Collar Crime
 
Over the past two decades, there have been numerous suggestions in the academic literature 
and in political debate that gambling is associated with white
-
collar crimes,
 
such as embezzlement, 
forgery and fraud. The motivation for such crimes, especially on the part of disordered gamblers,

seems obvious. If one is accumulating significant losses at a casino, one way to finance such losses 

trust to commit a financial crime. 
 
A link between casinos and gambling and white

collar crime has been cited in countless 

American Insurance Institute estimate
s that 40 percent of white
-
collar crime has its root in 

455
 
The problem is, as explained by Joseph Kelly, the American Insurance Institute does 
not exist. The citation to this statistic often appears in anti
-
casino writings, some dating back to 
198
0, even though no one has apparently ever seen the report from which this statistic is said to 
come.
456
 
Nevertheless, there is likely a motivation for individuals, particularly with gambling 
problems, to engage in white
-
collar crime to finance their gambling
. 

Fowler
 
suggests 
that white
-
collar crime is a problem associated with gambling in Florida, although it has not 
received adequate research attention to date.
457
  
 
Indeed, there has been very limited research on a link between white
-
collar crime an
d 
casinos (or gambling, generally). A review of the literature finds one recent study. The 2008 study 
by Jay Albanese specifically examines the impact of the introduct
ion of casinos on certain white
-
collar crime arrests. Albanese provides national arrest d
ata for embezzlement, forgery, and fraud, 
between 1988 and 2005. (He excluded juvenile arrests from his data.) Embezzlement arrests 
increased by about 20
 
percent
 
over the period, forgery arrests increased by 19
 
percent
, and fraud 
arrests decreased by about
 
11
 
percent
.
458
 
Since casino gambling, particularly by disordered gamblers, may be a motivation to 
engage
 
in white
-
collar crimes (for example, in order to gain money with which to gamble), Albanese also 
examines arrest rates before and after the introduction
 
of casinos in several markets: Atlantic City, 
NJ; Connecticut; Detroit, MI, and St. Louis, MO. Albanese also considers Las Vegas; even though 
casino gambling has existed there since the 1930s, Las Vegas grew dramatically during the 1990s. 
Albanese summari
zes his findings on these markets:
 
The pre
-
 
and post
-
casino arrest trends in these large casino jurisdictions were remarkably 
consistent, but unexpected. Embezzlement arrests increased in Connecticut (and 
nationwide), but declined in the other casino juris
dictions. Forgery arrests dropped in the 
casino jurisdictions despite a general increase in forgery arrests nationwide. Fraud arrests 
also dropped in casino jurisdictions, reflecting nationwide trends. These results indicate

that there have been mostly net
 
decreases in average annual arrests for these white collar 
offenses in these large casino jurisdictions.
459
 
There are 

arrest counts, not arrest rates (i.e., they are not per cap
ita arrest rates). However, given the large 
number of tourists that visit casinos, this omission is likely to cause an overstatement of the crime 
rates in casino jurisdictions. In addition the picture may look different if convictions, rather than 
arrests,
 
were considered. Finally, as Albanese notes (p. 342), it is impossible to determine whether 
gambling was the motivation for these crimes. 
 
Albanese focuses his di
scussion of the causes of white
-
collar crime on embezzlement, since
 
those
 
arrest numbers incr
eased nationwide during the period he studied. He cites evidence from 
interviews of prisoners who were convicted of embezzlement. Although there 
is
 
a variety of stated 
causes for embezzlement, gambling is not one of the more common suggested causes. Rather, 

together when threatened with financial problems, wh

Political Corruption

seeking money to fund their gambling, historically there has been a concern 
about gambling and 
political corruption. The late 
US 
Senator Paul Simon wrote

has any invol
vement in the industry, and whether politicians systematically engage in corrupt 
activities with respect to the casino industry.
 
As with white
-
collar crime and street crime, there may seem to be an obvious motivation 
for corruption related to the gambling 
industry, and casinos in particular. First, the casino industry 
is growing very rapidly and is largely a cash business. Perhaps this would make it easier for the 
industry to corrupt the casino industry. More importantly, the casino industry needs politicia

consent to exist. Since state governments control almost every aspect of the casino industry 
perhaps the spread of casinos across the United States is due, in part, to corrupt politicians. 
Alternatively, there could be a link whereby, once casinos are 
legal and operating, they contribute 
to the corruption of politicians in an attempt to win favorable regulatory changes.
 
Spectrum has significant experience in New Jersey, where the possibility of political 
corruption was first addressed in the Casino Cont
rol Act of 1977, in which Sec. 138 
includes the 

No applicant for or holder of a casino license, nor any holding, intermediary 
or subsidiary company thereof, nor any officer, director, casino key employee or principal 
employee of an app
licant for or holder of a casino license or of any holding, intermediary or 
subsidiary company thereof nor any person or agent on behalf of any such applicant, holder, 
company or person, shall directly or indirectly, pay or contribute any money or thing of
 
value to 
any candidate for nomination or election to any public office in this State, or to any committee of 
any political party in this State, or to any group, committee or association organized in support of 
any such candidate or political party

463
 
In o
ur experience, that provision was designed to help ensure public confidence in the 
governance of gaming, and was not 

 
nor could it have been 

 
expected to hermetically seal the 
industry from politics, or vice versa. Indeed, as noted earlier, the provision
 
did not prevent 
corruption, but it might have reduced it, and arguably achieved its principal goal of fostering 
confidence in the governance of gaming.
 
Since 2006, the casino/gambling industry has spent roughly $30 million per year on 
lobbying federal pol
iticians; it employs over 400 lobbyists.
464
 
Of course, it is legal for individuals 

influence on the government that regulates it.
 
It would be i
ncredibly tim
e
-
consuming to analyze individual corruption arrests to 
determine whether they are directly linked to casinos. However, there have been some high
-
profile 
arrests that were linked to gambling. Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich was convicted for

convictions and casino adoptions/revenues using data from 1985 to 2000. Their 
statistical analysis focuses on whether changes in one variable (e.g., corruption convictions) 
improve the prediction of the other variable (e.g., casino revenues), and vice vers
a. If there is such

f casinos. Rather, they find 
evidence that predicted casino adoptions lead to corruption convictions. This suggests that casinos 


dustry they are supposed to regulate. Anecdotal evidence of 
regulatory capture by the casino industry can be seen in a variety of states. For example, several 
states that initially had casino loss limits (for example, $500 per casino cruise) have since 
eli
minated those limits. Some states which used to require casinos to be on boats no longer do.
468
 
While such examples of regulatory changes favorable to the casino industry may be 
examples of regulatory capture, it should also be noted that the regulators them
selves may benefit 
when regulations benefit the industry, as many state casino regulatory agencies are funded directly 

empirical analysis to suggest a statistical lin
k between casinos and corruption, one could criticize 
the study because it does not directly link casinos or the gambling industry to particular corruption 
convictions. In any case, a carefully designed regulatory framework for the casino industry can be 
t
he best way of preventing any corruption associated with casinos.

trend
 
in bankruptcies coincided with the expansion of commercial casinos outside of Nevada and 
New Jersey during the early 1990s, so the increased availability of casinos and spike in 
bankruptcies could be related. Several studies have been published that exami
ne this relationship. 
Key findings of these studies are described. 
 
Nichols et al. studied bankruptcies from 1989 through 1998 in eight casino jurisdictions 
and control jurisdictions without casinos. They found that personal
 
bankruptcy rates increased in 
s
even of the eight
 
casino communities they studied.
470
 
The study by de la Viña and Bernstein 
examined 100 counties in 36 states, from 1989 through 1994; they did not find a relationship 
between the introduction of casinos and county bankruptcy rates.
471
 
However
, their lack of results 
may be because their study only went to 1994, only five years after casinos began to spread outside 
of Nevada and New Jersey. A more recent study found that bankruptcy rates in casino counties are 
initially higher than non
-
casino co
unties, but then casino
-
county rates actually fall below non
-
casino counties four to eight years after casinos are introduced. But rates again start to rise, and 
thirteen years after the introduction of casinos, bankruptcy rates in casino counties are 15
 
p
ercent
 
higher than in non
-
casino counties.
472
   
 
Barron et al. examined data for over 3,000 
US
 
counties. Their results suggest that 
bankruptcy rates are higher closer to casinos, and that if casinos were eliminated there would be a 
5
 
percent
 
decline in 1998 
filing rates in casino counties.
473
 
Finally, the study by Garrett and Nichols 
indicates that individuals who visit out
-
of
-
state casinos have a 10
 
percent
 
higher chance of filing 
for bankruptcy back in their home states, compared to individuals who did not vi
sit out
-
of
-
state 
casinos.
474
 
There have been several other journal articles that examine bankruptcy rates and their 
relationship to casinos. Considering those studies discussed above and the others in the literature, 
the majority of the evidence suggests 
that the existence of casinos does cause an increase in 
personal bankruptcy rates, especially in close proximity to casinos. It is likely that disordered 
gamblers are disproportionately responsible for the bankruptcy effect, as they are more likely than 
ot
hers to experience financial problems because of their gambling.

Drunk Driving Fatalities
 
Many casinos 
provide their patrons with free alcohol
ic beverages
 
as long as they are 
gambling. Indeed, like bars, casinos represent an increasingly popular form of ni
ghttime 
entertainment. To the extent that alcohol is relatively cheap at many casinos, then one might exp
e
ct 
there to be a link between casinos and drunk driving. 
 
There has not been published work that has studied the relationship between casinos and 
DUI 
arrests in the United States. However, one study examined casinos and alcohol
-
related traffic 
fatalities (

ARFAs

). The 2010 study by Cotti and Walker examined data from 1990 to 2000, a 
period that covers much of the recent 
US
 
commercial casino expansion o
utside of Nevada and 
New Jersey. Their findings indicate that there is indeed a relationship between the existence of 
casinos and ARFAs.
475
 
However, the relationship appears to be related to miles driven. In short, 
the study finds that ARFAs increase by 9.2 
percent for casino counties with average population. 
However, the effect declines as county population incre
ases. Specifically, they write:
 
[R]
ural or moderately sized counties will likely see an increase in alcohol
-
related fatal 
traffic accidents when cas
inos are present, but urban or greater
-
than
-
average populous 
counties may be expected to see a decrease in alcohol
-
related fatal traffic accidents when 
casinos are present.
 

son drunk 
driving fatalities are likely to increase in rural casino counties is that the average patron must drive 
more miles to get to and from the casino. This increases the likelihood that an individual will be 
in a traffic accident. At the same time, i
n urban or more populated casino counties, patrons do not 
have to drive as far, and they often have alternatives to driving, such as taking a cab, bus, or other 
public transportation. In addition, the authors suggest that urban casinos may serve as a subst
itute 
for bars and nightclubs, at which the average patron may consume more alcohol than at casinos.

Negative Personal/Professional Impacts from Gambling
 
Much of the discussion in this section thus far has focused on potential negative impacts 
associated 
with gambling for which there are solid, publicly available data. Such data facilitate 
academic studies on the effects. Yet, a variety of negative social impacts from problem gambling

Nevertheless, there is solid anecdotal evidence that such problems exist. For example, the 
National Gambling Impact Study Commission 


discusses suicide, divorce, and 
homelessness rates, among other social problems often attributed to gambling.
477
 
The NGISC 
describes a variety of individuals who testified that their lives had been shattered because of their 
own gambling problem or b

Grinols
 
dedicates 21 pages in his book to reproducing newspaper headlines and quotations that 
provide anecdotal evidence of social problems and gambling.
478
 
However, such cases may grab 
the atten
tion of newspaper reporters and readers precisely because they are unusual or 
extraordinary cases. 
 
One must look at academic research to determine whether a statistical link between 
gambling problems and these other problems exists. The National Research 
Council provides a 
review of research, prior to 1999, on many of the social impacts of gambling.
479
 
Even then, 
however, the research on these issues was still relatively sparse. 
 
As with the crime discussion from above, there is quite likely to be a distinct
ion between 
the results from research that examines individuals (such as through survey research on Gamblers 
Anonymous members) and research that examines aggregates (such as studies on divorce or crime 
rates at the county
-
 
or state
-
level). We review some 
of the evidence from each of these types of 
studies.
 
The study by Thompson et al. (1997) examined data collected from a survey of 98 
Gamblers Anonymous members in Wisconsin.
480
 
They report that 21 of their respondents indicated 
they had lost or quit their jo
bs, and attributed it to gambling. Of this group, 18 reported being 
unemployed for an average of over 12 months. Sixty
-
four of the respondents indicated missing 
work because of gambling. Thirty
-
eight of the respondents had been arrested, only 14 of which 
w
ere attributed directly to gambling. Among the 98 respondents, 57 had sought professional help 
for their gambling problem; 15 had been hospitalized. Many of the survey respondents had other 
behavioral problems: 30 were alcoholics; 25 were compulsive shoppe
rs; 22 compulsive overeaters; 
and 14 drug addicts. 
 
Twelve of the respondents indicated they had marriage and family problems. Among the 
30 respondents who were separated or divorced, 70
 
percent
 
indicated that gambling was a cause. 
These effects of gamblin
g are likely to have a significant impact on children. Problem gamblers 
are also probably more likely than the general population to consider or commit suicide. The

survey of Gamblers Anonymous members indicated that 69 respondents had thought about suicid
e, 
59 indicated they planned how they would commit suicide, and 23 had actually attempted suicide.
 
The survey statistics reported by Thompson et al. are indeed startling. However, as they 
represent GA members, they perhaps represent the extreme end of the 
distribution of individuals 
in society with the most serious gambling problems. A variety of other studies reports on similar 
social impacts of disordered gambling. The N
ational Gambling Impact Study Commission
 
and the 
National Research Council
481
 
provide co
mprehensive discussions of many of these social impacts.

issues, sorted b

S
tudies that focus on disordered gamblers find that such individuals often have o
ther 
behavioral problems and issues. Similar results have been found with respect to crime, although 
there is not clear evidence that casinos affect crime rates. There is an important distinction between 


aggregate statistics. Although the studies cited above point to a variety of problems experienced 
by disordered gamblers and their surrounding society, these results do not always hold at an 
aggregate level. For e
xample, one study examined county
-
level rates of suicide and divorce in 
eight new casino jurisdictions, comparing them to similar non
-
casino control jurisdictions.
483
 
The 
results are summarized: 
 
Suicide rates are not statistically different between casino a
nd control communities. 
Divorce rates are lower in three casino counties, higher in one, and not statistically different 
in four. Overall, the results suggest no widespread, statistically significant increase in either 
suicide or divorce.
484
 
These results co
uld be interpreted as meaning that casinos do not contribute to suicide and 
divorce. However, since the study relies on county
-
level data, one may not expect statistically 
significant results, especially since only about 1
 
percent
 
of the population is like
ly to have a 
gambling disorder.
485
 
 
Despite the lack of results in macro studies of the negative impacts of gambling, 
jurisdictions should be aware that such problems are likely to occur, even if they affect a relatively 
small number of people.
 
NIMBY
 
One gen
eral concern that many people have with respect to legal gambling (and expanded 


 
brings with 
it more traffic, perhaps more crime, and a variety of other changes that may fundamentally change 
a community. A person may not necessarily be opposed to the activity of gambling, but they would 
prefer that it not be located near their home.

as social impacts.
 
Design State policy that addresses the regula

Challenge:
 
Although Florida State government has and continues to promote gambling expansion, at 
no time has it ever established a 
dedicated
 
fund for problem and compulsive gambling 
prevention, education, research, and treatment
.

necessitated that the FCCG 
identify another funding source willing to subsidize free treatment in instances 
when compulsive gamblers or concerned persons lack adequate insurance or 

. 
However, if the State is going to promote and s

impacted.)
 
Solution:
 
Legislatively establish a dedicated fund for problem gambling prevention, education, 
research, and treatment, based upon a percentage of State revenu
es generated by Florida 
based gaming operations
. 
This will resolve existing and longstanding voids within the 
problem gambling community and result in appropriate widespread awareness and 
treatment for Florida residents.
 
Challenge:
 
Currently, private and 
managed care providers do not furnish appropriate, consistent 
and/or comprehensive insurance coverage for pathological diagnoses in problem 
gamblers, or for persons adversely affected by gambling
. 
They also do not facilitate 
treatment for problem gambling
 
for persons presenting with co

Solution:
 

reclassified as an addictive disorder (i.e. DSM

Legislature
 
cou
ld take steps requiring insurance providers to furnish coverage for persons with positive 
diagnoses or for those adversely affected (e.g. family members and other loved ones). 
 
Challenge:
 
Few substance abuse, mental health, medical, and other health care p
rofessionals ask 
clients about their gambling habits
. 
As a result, the early signs of a gambling problem are 
overlooked, particularly in conjunction with other addictive, mental health or medical 
conditions
. 
So, while nearly all patients presenting in me
dical offices, drug and treatment 
programs, mental health facilities, emergency rooms, and elsewhere are subject to 
screening for tobacco, alcohol and other substances, they are not preliminarily screened 
for gambling
. 
Yet, more than one
-
third of compulsi
ve gamblers in treatment experience 
other addictive or mental health disorders, and a significant percentage suffer from an 
array of medical conditions. 
 
Solution:
 
Educate a broad array of existing health care professionals and institute programming 
within
 
medical universities and other academic institutions to assure awareness and 
competency to systematically assess for gambling related difficulties.
 
Challenge:
 
Problem gamblers in Florida do not currently have access to therapeutic justice as is the 
case f
or those experiencing substance abuse, mental health and domestic violence 
difficulties. In particular, Florida does not currently have a system that identifies those 
with gambling problems at all levels within law enforcement and criminal justice faciliti
es
. 
As a result, problem gamblers are not identified nor are the protocols for sentencing, 
release or reintegration into communities considering the nuances directly impacting this 
population and/or the potential ramifications to families, communities and
 
the State as a 
whole. 
 
Solutions:
 
Develop screening mechanisms to identify problem gambling at appropriate points, from 
the initial investigation through arrest, booking to arraignment, and trial and sentencing.
 
Train law enforcement personnel, defense an
d prosecuting attorneys, and Judges on 
screening, identifying and responding to problem gamblers, both in traditional and 
therapeutic justice settings

Challenge:
 
Public school students are not being exposed t
o programming related to problem gambling 
despite research sponsored by the FCCG based upon the findings from the Florida 
Department of Children and Families' Youth Substance Abuse Survey, revealing that more 
than half the students reported gambling in the
 
past year, 13% have done so once a month 
or more, and 4% bet weekly
. 
 
In addition, 15 % admitted to having arguments with family 
or friends due to gambling (which is a problem gambling indicator)
. 

independent study, Gambling Among Florida Mid
dle and High School Students, revealed 
(per the DCF Youth Survey) that gamblers are over two times more likely than non
-

during the past year. 
 
Furthermore, although th
e Florida Departments of Lottery, Education, Health, Office of 

public school system, to date, nothing has been required
. 
(Note:
 
A joint letter from these 
o
rganizations we
re sent to every school superintendent but no action has been 
systematically taken. Since this time, the FCCG has also devised programming for 
elementary school (Smart Choices) and college students (SAGA 

 
Students Against 
Gambling Addiction). 
 
Solution:  
 
Require the use of problem gambling programming as a natural extension to existing 
dialogue about tobacco, alcohol and substance use, abuse, prevention and treatment. 
 
Challenge:
 
Responsible gaming programs by Florida gaming operators vary, as do practices regarding 
self
-
exclusion
. 
Presently, not all gambling venues implement responsible gaming programs 
and in other instances where protocols are established, they often reflect bar
e minimum 
provisions which are deficient in providing necessary training to employees, safeguards to 
protect the patron population, and/or strategies for aiding a person in need of assistance 
for a gambling problem. And while there are establishments adher
ing to high standards, 
the State lacks consistency throughout the industry.

206
 
 
Further, self
-
exclusion is intended to preclude patrons from returning to a facility for a set 
period of time, up to a lifetime
. 
However, it is not working effectively throughout 
the State, 
lacks uniformity statewide, allows excluded persons to return to excluded properties 
because facility employees are not enforcing provisions (which is also a liability for the 
gaming operator), and requires that these patrons travel to different
 
gambling facilities to 
self
-
exclude versus implementing a statewide clearinghouse).
 
Solution:
 
Legislatively mandate implementation of a comprehensive responsible gaming program 
that requires minimum standards, assures adequate employee training, conspicuo
us 
disclosure of the statewide helpline, and develops and oversees a statewide self
-
exclusion 
registry that reflects the spirit of self
-
exclusion and serves as a disincentive for patrons to 
return to a property or to attempt to gamble elsewhere.

Positive 
Impacts
 
Legalized gambling has expanded in the United States quite dramatically since the 1960s. 
The lottery was introduced in New Hampshire in 1964, and now 43 states have a state
-
operated 
lottery. Horse and greyhound racing are also very common. Casinos,
 
which began to spread outside 
of Nevada and New Jersey in the late 1980s, a
re now legal in 42
 
states. 
 
State governments and voters tend to approve the legalization of commercial casinos for 
economic reasons. That is they expect significant economic benef
its from the introduction of 
casinos. These benefits may include increased employment and an increase in average wages, 
economic growth (i.e., increases in per capita income), and increased tax revenues. These effects 
are discussed in 
Chapter III
; here we 
provide a brief introduction to the literature on these economic 
benefits, particularly from casinos.
 
Employment and Wages
 
The casino industry promotes itself by publicizing employment data. Casinos can g
enerate 
employment through the construction of their
 
facilities and then through 
the
ir
 
day
-
to
-
day 
operation
s
. The 
casino 
industry is very labor
-
intensive. As an example of this, the American 

State of the State 
annual report lists the number of casino employees in each 
state with commerc
ial casinos.
489
 

-
level 
aggregate. There is certainly an effect on local labor markets when a new casino is built and 
operating. In general, one can think of the new casino as causing an increase in the 
demand for 
labor. As a result average wages should increase as employment increases. 
 
However, casino critics often argue that casino jobs are low
-
quality, low
-
paying jobs. 
There are no academic studies of which we are aware that confirm this contention. P
erhaps the

most comprehensive, best analysis of the labor market effects of casinos was written by Chad Cotti 
in 2008.
490
 
Cotti analyzes 
US
 
county
-
level data, comparing counties with and without a casino. He 
finds that casino counties see an increase in empl
oyment after a casino opens. Further, his analysis 
shows that casinos create modest benefits to both employment and wages, but that the employment 
growth is negatively related to county population. (That is, there is a smaller impact on 
employment growth i
n more populous casino counties.) 
 

-
casino counties, and because 
he controls for other economic variables in his analysis, we can be confident that his analysis 
isolates the impact of casinos. W
hat his analysis does not show is the net effect of casinos 
compared to some other specific non
-
casino industry. In order to analyze the effects of gambling 
in Florida, jurisdictions in which casinos or pari
-
mutuels are operating should be compared to othe
r 
non
-
gaming jurisdictions, while controlling for other economic variables. 
 
These results should not be surprising, as a casino represents new economic activity in a 
local economy. As with other new businesses, one should expect that a new casino will cre
ate jobs. 
However, measuring the impact of casinos on employment requires a consideration of the 
net 
impact
. That is, simply because a casino employs 1,000 workers does not necessarily mean that 
the casino created 1,000 new jobs. Some jobs may have been lo
st in other competing industries. 
Nevertheless, the available empirical evidence suggests that casinos have a positive impact on the 
labor markets in which they operate.
 
Economic Growth
491
 
The casino industry does not typically promote itself as generating e
conomic growth. This 
is probably because, as a political matter, how a casino would generate economic growth is a more 
abstract concept then, say, the creation of jobs. However, politicians often claim that casinos can 
be used as a tool for redevelopment.
 
Casinos can lead to economic growth simply because they represent new economic activity 

of economic development.
492
 
This proposition has been tested with respect
 
to casinos. 
 
The most recent evidence on the issue uses Granger causality analysis. Basically
,
 
what this 
statistical test does is determine whether the use of one variable (casino revenues) can improve the 
prediction of another variable (per capita income


variables. The Granger causality analysis uses data from 
US
 
states with commercial casinos, from

1990 through 2010.
 
The analysis indicates strong statistical evidence that casino revenues do 
Granger cause economic growth. 
493
 
If we step back and consider what causes economic growth (increases in per capita income) 
to occur, it boils down to mutually beneficial transactio
ns. That is, whenever a market transaction 
occurs between buyer and seller, both parties are expecting to benefit as a result of the transaction; 
otherwise they would not agree to trade. 
 
The benefits of such transactions can be easily seen, especially for
 
the sellers. Profit is 
simply the difference between the selling price and cost of production. This is the net benefit to 
the seller, which is the amount of money that remains after paying for the inputs to production. On 

here is a similar benefit from the transaction, but it is a little more 
abstract. Consumers typically receive more in benefits from consumption than they had to pay for 
it. For example, if a person is so thirsty that 
he would
 
be willing to pay $5 for a sod
a, but 
he has
 
to pay only $2 
at the neighborhood grocery, 
he
 
receive
s
 
a $3 net benefit from the transaction. In a 

 
Any business that provides a good or service for which people are willing to pay helps to 
foster this process of mutually beneficial exchange. This is simply economic activity, which is the 
basis of economic growth. It matters little what type of business 
it is, as long as the customers 
receive benefits from the product at least as great as the amount they must pay. 
 
As new businesses are formed, workers must be hired to produce the goods and services. 
This creates increased competition for workers; that 
is, there is greater demand for workers, and 
wages are likely to be pushed up as a result. The new firm must offer a salary and/or benefits in 

-
best option; otherwise the new firm will not be able to find suitable 
employees. It is po
ssible that the new firm would simply hire individuals who are currently 
unemployed. In this case, the new job still presumably represents an improvement over the 

 
Tax Revenues
 
Legalized gambling, in general, and casin
os, in particular, can have a significant impact on 
state government budgets. Yet, the effect is not as large as many observers believe. In 2004, 
legalized gambling accounted for less than 2
 
percent
 
of state revenues in most states. In Nevada, 
casino taxes
 
represented 10.4
 
percent
 
of state revenues. In Florida, the lottery represented about 
1.7
 
percent
 
of state government revenues during 2004.

It should be noted that a similar study performed in 2007 did 
not find a Granger causal relationship between casinos and economic growth. However, as noted above, the most 
recent evidence suggests there is such a relationship.

Although legalized gambling is usually taxed at relatively 
high rates, this does not 
necessarily mean that the 
existence of a 
gambling industry necessarily results in a net increase of 


495
 
away from other 
consumption, legalized gambling could 
actually result in a decrease in tax revenues. This result is 
unlikely in most jurisdictions, however, since tax rates on gambling are typically much higher than 

 
percent
. The
 
effective 
tax
 
rate on gross 
casino
 
revenue
 
range
s
 
from 7
 
percent
 
in Nevada to over 50
 
percent
 
in 
several states
. 
 
Several researchers have examined the impact of legalized casinos and lotteries on state 
government revenues. For example, Siegel and Anders 
(1999) examine how Missouri county sales 
tax revenues were affected by the introduction of riverboat casinos.
496
 
They studied 1994
-
96 data, 
and found that a 10
 
percent
 
increase in gambling tax revenue leads to about a 4
 
percent
 
decrease 
in taxes from other a
musement and recreation sources. The study by Borg et al. (1993) found that 
$1 in lottery revenue has a cost of 15
-
23 cents in other types of government revenue.
497
 
However, 


is not very great.
 
The study by Walker and Jackson (2011) is probably the most comprehensive tax study in 
the United States, to date.
498
 
They found statistical evidence that lotteries do lead to an increase in 
state net tax receipts, 
but that the positive effect diminishes as sales increase. Their casino result 
was interesting, that casinos have a mildly negative impact on state tax receipts. However, their 
analysis also finds a positive impact on state tax revenues from increases in p
er capita income (i.e., 
economic growth) and hotel employees (as a proxy for tourism). If casinos generate economic

of casinos on taxes is probably not positive, the overall impact of casinos may be positive when 
the economic growth and tourism effects of casinos are accounted for.

Gambling
-
Specific vs. Non
-
Gambling Impacts (
Job 
Creation and 
Wage Changes
)
 
For any of the impacts discussed in the previous section, understanding the specific effects 
of gambling is more complicated than it may initially seem. This is because the relevant 
comparison for understan
ding the changes in society caused by gambling is not just between the 
situations before and after gambling is introduced. Rather, the relevant comparison is between the 
situation with gambling and 
what otherwise would have happened
, called the 

counterfac
tual.

 
Consider an example in which there is a single plot of vacant land in a city, and the land 

is eventually built. Then there will be employment and wa
ge effects, for example, resulting from 
the building and opening of the casino. The jobs created by the casino, the wages paid, and taxes 
paid will likely be reported as the effect of the casino on the local/regional economy. The reported 
benefits of the c
asino are those compared to the situation prior to the casino being built. But this 
assumes that if the casino had not been built, nothing else would have been. But in our scenario, a 
shopping mall would have been built. Then to determine the net impact of
 
a new casino, the effects 
of the casino should be compared to what would have likely happened had the shopping mall been 
built instead.
 
For the practical analysis of the impacts of casinos, it is difficult to always know what 
would have otherwise happened
. One way of isolating the impact of casinos is to compare the 
situation in casino communities with those in non
-
casino communities. As an analysis of 
aggregates, this type of analysis can isolate the marginal impact of casinos, as long as other 
variables 
are controlled for in the analysis.
 
Perhaps more importantly, in considering the impacts of casinos, it is important to 
distinguish those effects that are specific to the nature of gambling (such as crime committed by 
problem gamblers), and those that also
 
result from a casino, but are simply economic impacts 
caused by a new firm/industry entering a local economy. 
 
By way of example, if wages increase in a community because some of its previously 
unemployed and under
-
employed adults are working at a casino,
 
that would increase spending 
power in that region. That increased spending power could potentially result in increased 
investment by non
-
gaming businesses. 
 
Hypothetically, such investments could include, say, a regional supermarket chain or a 
national ph
armacy outlet in an area that previously did not warrant such investments. This 
economic growth would be casino
-
related, but it is not the result of gaming, in particular. 
Alternatively, consider if a local food store or local pharmacy is adversely impacte
d and 
hypothetically goes out of business, it is clearly an impact of the casino. But it is not necessarily 
gaming
-
related, but is rather related to general economic growth. Moreover, such an impact is 
adverse to that pharmacy owner, but may not be adverse
 
to the community.

211
 
 
Similarly, if a casino raises the prevailing wage in an area, particularly for unskilled or 
semi
-
skilled work, that could have an adverse impact on a number of small businesses, such as 
small hotels, restaurants or fast
-
food franchises. 
Some may find that they cannot afford to pay the 
prevailing wage rate and still be profitable
. 
That is an impact of casinos, but is not related to the 
specific nature of gambling, nor is it clear whether that is adverse or beneficial to the larger 
communit
y.
 
Historically, Atlantic City and the Miami region, particularly Miami Beach, have had much 
in common, starting with their histories as East Coast tourist destinations. At various times, both 
endured economic downturns and experienced rebounds 

 
sometimes
 
with the same results 

 
but 


detected, as noted in a 2012 blog
: 
 
There is a flip
-
side to Miami's rebound. While the super

rich are buying, locals continue to 
suffer. Wages and income levels are low, and the metro has a high level of income 
inequality. Miami's housing market and broader economy remains highly uneven a
nd 
divided. While South Beach and the downtown corridor may be booming, the area inland 
is rife with housing misery, foreclosures and homelessness. The economic and social 
distance between the global super

The Substitution Effect
 
The introduction or expansion of legalized gambling, in particular casino gambling, raises 
a variety of concerns. Although casinos are often introduced in order to raise tax revenues, create 
jobs, and spur economic development, 
many observers have a concern for the potential 

casino(s) will be redirected from other local or regional businesses, with the end result that the 
casinos have n


industries.
502
 
Fundamentally, the substitution effect is not unique to the casino ind
ustry. Indeed, anytime 
any new business opens, there is the potential that an addition to the local economy will be harmful 
to incumbent firms and industries. This is because the substitution effect is essentially synonymous 
with market competition. As suc
h, from an economic perspective, the substitution effect is not 
necessarily a cause for concern. Casinos compete for a share of discretionary incomes within their 
respective markets, as would be expected from any segment of the entertainment or leisure 
ind
ustries. When adults elect to visit a casino, rather than the theater or a museum, the casino wins 
and the alternative loses. Quite often, however, the reverse is true 

 
and the number of precise 
alternatives competing for a share of discretionary spending
 
is so vast, even in smaller markets, 
that it would defy any efforts to track precise winners and losers.
 
Such efforts are further complicated because, not only are there many options for 
discretionary dollars, we point out that overall discretionary spend
ing also competes against 
savings. A dollar saved is a dollar not spent, and vice versa.

Notably, Spectrum suggests there is a potential negative correlation between the savings 
rate and gaming spending. For example, in 2006, a pre
-
recession period that wa
s at or near the 
high
-
water mark for gaming revenue in both Atlantic City and Nevada, the national savings rate 
had sunk to a seven
-
decade low, as reported in early 2007 in 
The
 
New York Times
:
 
Americans once again spent everything they made and then some l
ast year, pushing the 
personal savings rate to the lowest level since the Great Depression more than seven 
decades ago
. 
 

1 percent, meaning that not only did people spe
nd all the money they earned but they also 
dipped into savings or increased borrowing to pay for purchases.
 
The 2006 figure was lower than a negative 0.4 percent in 2005 and was the poorest showing 
since a negative 1.5 percent savings rate in 1933 during t
he Great
 
Depression.
503
 
Notably, that original estimate of a negative savings rate was since revised by the 
US 
Commerce Department, taking it out of negative territory. Yet the principle that low savings 
equates to increased disposable income, which benefits
 
certain leisure industries, remains 
unchanged. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York published the following in 2007: 
 
By definition, personal saving is the difference between actual current
-
dollar after
-
tax 
(disposable) income and current
-
dollar spending.
 
Many have observed that increases in 
wealth (assets such as stocks and homes, less debt) relative to disposable income, both over 
the last generation and during the more recent rise, could have worked to boost spending 
relative to income and reduced the p
ersonal saving rate. This is especially true to the extent 
that these rises in wealth are linked to increases in expected future income, thus elevating 
permanent income relative to disposable income.
504
 
Our analysis and experience suggests that the success o
f gaming in destination markets 
such as Las Vegas during periods of low savings is not coincidental. This was generally a period 
in which both the stock and housing markets were robust, creating a general feeling of well
-
being 
in which household net worth 
was increasing by itself, without the need for additional savings, and 
much of that increased spending 

 
the flip side of decreased savings 

 
benefited the casino industry, 
as evidenced in the following chart, which tracks data in Las Vegas through the per
iod of low 
savings, right through the first, most traumatic months of the Great Recession:

As the chart shows, an increase in the savings rate shrinks the pie of discretionary dollars, 
which affects the gaming industry and, presumably, other leisure industries as well, further 
complicating any analysis regarding subst
itution.
 

the Commonwealth 
of 
Massachusetts noted the following:
 
We note a very important point that was articulated rather well by Michael E. Porter who 
makes the point that substitution is an omnipresent issue that must be viewe
d in a much 
larger context:

505
 
With that in mind, we caution that any analysis of the substitution effect defies 
simplification. If a casu
al dining establishment loses customers to casino restaurants, it is 
easy to identify a competitive culprit. But what if patrons of high
-
end restaurants decide to 
alter their spending patterns, and shift more dollars to casual restaurants to free up more 
d
iscretionary income to visit a spa at a destination casino. Who benefits? Who suffers?

Casino advocates might argue that casinos should not be treated differently than other 
businesses; as long as they generate a profit, it implies the casino is satis
fying the wants of 


is of higher value than alternative pro
ducts; otherwise 

 
according to such economic logic 

 
consumers would not have changed their spending patterns. Two exceptions to this may be argued:
 

 
To some extent, casinos derive a portion of their revenues from problem or 
disordered gamblers, who do not
 
really exercise free choice if they have a gambling 
problem.
 

 
Casino licensure is largely viewed as a privilege that often comes with some level 
of exclusivity. As such, casinos have a concomitant obligation to act in the public 
interest, which can transla
te into policies that minimize substitution and focus more 
on attracting business from outside the region or state.
 
There have been a few academic papers that have addressed the substitution effect, either 
directly o
r in a round
-
about way. Figure 51
 
summar
izes some of these studies. Most of the studies 
examine data from the 1990s.

Potential Impact of Commercial Casinos on New York Lottery Ticket Sales and Video Gaming Machine

Note:

As shown in the above table, not all industries appear to act as substitutes across state lines. 
However, the availability of casinos tends to harm casinos and lotteries in neighboring states. 
Lotteries also harm lotteries in neighboring states.
 
Three other studies offer some insight into the substitution effect. One is a county

level 
study that examines the labor market effects (employment and wages) of casinos. The 2008 study 
by Cotti analyzes the effects on labor of counties that have a casino
 
(or casinos), relative to those

inos in nearby states, rather than the casino 
revenues in neighboring states.

Cotti finds that, generally, casino counties fare better, in terms of employment and 
wages, relative to non

sing both employment, earnings, and promoting economic development 

a casino represents a relatively large business in a smaller community. The evidence s
uggests that, 
on net, there is no net negative impact of casinos on employment or wages. This is not to say, 
however, that some industries may not see a negative impact from the introduction of casinos
. 
 
 
Another study examines the effect of casinos on ret
ail property values. In their 2011 paper, 
Wiley and Walker examine how casinos in Detroit have affected property values, based on 
commercial property sales data.
519
 
Their results suggest that the casinos tend to have a positive 
impact on property values, par
ticularly for some sectors related to tourism (e.g., service stations, 

the only published papers to directly examine the effect of casinos on other non
-
casin
o businesses. 
Of course, not every community will see the same relationship to casinos that Detroit does.
 
Finally, the 2007 paper by Wenz examined the impact of casinos on residential property 
values.
520
 
Wenz found that casinos have a net positive impact on 
housing prices, of about 2 percent, 
in the same geographic area as a casino. At the same time, property values in bordering areas see 
an even greater effect, of about 6 percent. Notably, most of the casino areas analyzed are tribal 

ts may be due partially to the fact that tribal casinos may be more likely 
to be located in relatively depressed local economies. Indeed, Wenz finds that the positive impacts 
of casinos decline as population density increases.
521
 
Several other studies (one o
n Atlantic City, 
and one on Windsor, Ontario) suggest, when the effect of crime is considered, the net impact of 
casinos on property values may be negative.
522
 
We caution that such studies, no matter how rigorous they may be in developing their 
models or ass
umptions, should never be taken at face value, particularly as authors rarely take into 
account the full complexity of issues. In Atlantic City, the notion that casinos had a negative effect 
on property values might comport within the parameters of a speci
fic model, but we would

respectfully point out that, in 1978 when the first casino opened, the entire assessed valuation of 
all property in Atlantic City was $308 million, a number that actually
 
had
 
been declining in tandem 

iral in the years preceding gambling.
523
 
Within two years, the 
assessed valuation grew by more than 182 percent,
524
 
a phenomenon that we would attribute almost 
entirely to the presence of this new industry. That growth, of course, did not dispel concerns about
 
the impact of casinos, and created new sets of problems for those property owners that faced 
steeper tax bills. 
 
When dealing with complex issues such as substitution, both facts and perceptions must be 
considered and addre
ssed.
 
In the case of casino gambling, it becomes an understandable concern 
for business owners, voters, politicians, and others because the introduction of casinos requires a 
positive act by government. Therefore, while there may be relatively little interest i
n, say, the 
economic impacts of opening a new restaurant in a particular neighborhood, that would not be the 
case with casinos.
 
Nevertheless, we can begin to identify the impacts of a new casino in Florida by 
considering the possible sources of spending at
 
the new casino. Those revenues would come from 
a combination of these sources:
 

 
New spending from Floridians
 

 
New spending from out
-
of
-
state tourists
 

 
Existing spending on other Florida non
-
gambling industries (by Floridians and tourists)
 

 
Existing spending 
on other Florida gambling industries (by Floridians and tourists)
 

 
Existing spending by Floridians on out
-
of
-
state purchases, including gambling
 
The evidence suggests that casinos are likely to have 
a 
negative impact on lotteries, and 
some other businesses 

different from what happens when any other business opens. Certainly some of the revenues for a 
new casino would come at the expense of other, existing gambling firms in Florida. R
evenues are 
likely to come from all five of the sources identified above, but it is very difficult to predict the 
exact percentage from each source. In any case, the substitution effect is relevant for any new 
business that opens.

Conclusion
 
To be sure, n
ew casinos create a substitution effect, but it is much less clear what the 
significance of it will be and which industries would be most affected by it. The academic studies

that have been performed suggest that, at least for non
-
gambling industries, casi
nos are more likely 
to act as complements than substitutes. This suggests that the concern over the substitution effect 
may be greater than is justified. After all, the casino industry has expanded across the United States 
over the past two decades, and th
ere is no evidence to suggest that this expansion has led to any 
long

hosting regional economies.
 
Still, we do not discount the importance of concerns regarding substitution, nor do we 
dismiss the notion that casin
os compete. Indeed, they compete against any other option that seeks 
a share of discretionary income. While it is difficult to determine with any level of precision which 
businesses will win and which will lose in such competitive battles, there is one ove

Term Fiscal Impacts of Government Policies
 
In an increasingly competitive global economy, casino gambling is seen as a quick and 
easy way to create jobs, increase c
onvention and tourism business and stimulate development of 
additional visitor attractions and amenities. However, to maximize the economic benefits of casino 
development and to minimize any potential negative impacts, it is vital that state and local poli
cy 
makers have a clear understanding of how different implementation scenarios and community 
variables may affect short and long term outcomes. 
 
Land
-
use planning 
and 
zoning power is the most effective tool that state and local 
governments have to plan for
 
and control development related impacts
. 
Casinos are unlike other 
types of development projects such as an office park or a shopping center
. 
Casino development 
may potentially have a greater impact on traffic, housing stock, the labor force and municipal 
services. Newer, more sophisticated planning tools such as geographic information systems and 
economic modeling enable government planning to have a better understanding of the potential 
impacts of projects and thereby plan more appropriately. 
 
A study of 
the impact of casino gambling in Connecticut by Spectrum found that the 
absence of regional planning had significantly impeded state and local officials in their efforts to 
address the impact of two Indian casinos on traffic, public safety and education.

other jurisdictions considering casino gambling. Casinos must be right sized and properly 
integrated into the

quickly to changing consumer tastes and market conditions. By establishing itself largely as a 
convenience destination, failing to plan for gaming competition elsewhere, and f
ailing to 
responsibly incorporate casinos into the social and economic fabric of the city, the prognosis for 
both Atlantic City and its casino industry is an open question.
 
Workforce development is another area where proper planning can have positive short

labor intensive and require a variety of skill levels to operate 
efficiently and meet the expectations of their patrons

Depending on the magnitude of their

Getting unskilled and low skilled workers into the workplace can be a challenge.
 
In Massachusetts, where casino development was recently enacted, it is anticipated that 
over 30,000 individuals will need to be considere

that are expected. To meet this objective, the state recently ramped up its workforce recruitment 
process and employment infrastructure. To accomplish this, a collaboration of workforce

The past three decades provide policy makers with an abundance of data and first
-
hand 
ex
amples of how casino gambling impacted a community and what the role of policy makers 
should be. However, a clear, compelling understanding of the costs and benefits remains elusive 
and the academic literature is contradictory. 
 
The 1999 
National Gambling 
Impact Study Commission Report noted that social and 
economic impacts are not as easily severable as those responsible for policy making would 
prefer
.
536
 
Quantifying gambling related social costs and benefits can be extremely difficult. The 
Commission went on to note that the economic benefits of casino gambling appeared most 
powerful in more financially distressed communities where economic development op
portunities 
were fewer.
 
In a 2005 study, Phineas Baxandall and Bruce Sacerdote compared the experience of 
counties in the United States that have casinos with counties that do not. They found that casino 
development appears to produce both modest positive 
effects as well a modest negative effects as 
well no statistically significant effects at all in some areas. They analyze the effects of casinos at 
the county level rather than the state level because entire states are simply too large to discern a 

s influences on outcomes such as employment or crime.
537
 
In 
Gambling in America: 
Costs 
and Benefits
, Earl Grinols found that when all relevant factors were considered, the social benefits 
of casino gambling were outweighed by the social costs.
538
 
The national experience with casino gambling has led policy makers, urban planners, social 

properly sized and blended into the host community. The type, scal
e and format of a casino will 
inevitably be a factor in what impact it has upon the community. 
 
Iowa was an early adopter of casino gambling and Dubuque is often cited as a community 
where casino gambling has been 
a 
successful component of an overall econo
mic development 
strategy. A 2011 report noted that one would be hard pressed to find someone opposed to casinos

Iowa is unique among states with casino gambling. In every county that has a casino,

notes how casino resorts have undergone significant transformations since 
they first appeared in Nevada in 1931. In their early form, they consisted of low
-
rise motel 
buildings with 200 to 800 rooms centered 
on 
a casino/theater/restaurant area. Other
 
design 
elements included spacious grounds and swimming pools. Beginning in the mid
-
1950s, casino 
operators developed larger, thousand
-
plus room hotel towers atop vast, low
-
rise buildings 
containing the casino, lounges, theaters, convention facilities and 
restaurants. All the amenities 
were integrated into a casino resort complex. In the 1990s, casino operators took these design 
elements further by devel
oping elegantly appointed 3,000
-
room plus hotel complexes. T
hese 
facilities, often costing $1
 
billion or 
more, had distinctive architectural designs, elegant spas and 
pool areas, gourmet restaurants associated with world recognized chefs and high

end retail. They 
also placed a greater emphasis on the non

gaming aspects of the facility.

Different Casino Models
 
Eadington believed that in terms of increasing t
he economic potential of casino gaming 
while minimizing the costs, the modern integrated resort casino
 
(another term for a destination 
casino 
resort
)
 

casinos. These are places wh
ere one mostly goes to play slot machines and table games. This type 
of facility generally will provide limited food and beverage options along with limited hotel 
accommodations, or none at all. Usually, 80
 
percent
 
or more of their revenues come from gamin
g 
activities.
546
 
Conversely, integrated resort casinos offer a wide variety of leisure and entertainment 
options other than just gambling. They all have iconic architecture and require significant capital 
investment
. 
By offering superior dining, 
entertainment and shopping, they often become popular 
attractions that appeal to both domestic and international tourists. They appeal to a broader market 
and compete more effectively for the high
-
end visitor dollar than gambling
-
centric casinos. The 
emplo
yment potential of integrated resort casinos is also greater. T
heir 24
-
hour operations, 
diversity of offerings and specialized services, require that they employ substantially more highly 
skilled and professionally trained employees than gaming
-
centric cas
inos.
547
 
 
Integrated resort casinos pose more potential for convention related growth. Convention 
and conference organizers prefer to have their event in a venue that attendees will find attractive 
and appealing in order to achieve maximum attendance. Conven
tion goers often want adult forms 
of entertainment. Integrated casino resorts with their vibrant nightlife, ample room supply, 
conference facilities and host of amenities can help fulfill that need
. 
 
Gary Loveman, Caesars Chairman and CEO, identified a hyb
rid model. He contends that 
the conventional view of casinos being either convenient neighborhood based slot parlors or as 
integrated resort casino destinations is incomplete. He states that over the past decade another 
model has emerged for policy makers

businesses and attractions. In this model, the casino serves as a hub whose spokes extend out

Conclusion
 
The academic research reviewed here suggests that casinos can have a variety of significant 
social and economic impacts, both positive and negative. Perhaps the most important question is 
whether 
casinos generate more benefits than costs. Unfortunately, the answer to this question is 
not obvious, and probably depends on the jurisdiction under consideration. Certainly in some 
jurisdictions, casinos have had a large positive impact, such as in Las Ve
gas and in the Gulf Coast 
of Mississippi. But casinos may bring their own problems. Most of the negative social impacts 

about 1
 
percent
 
of the general populatio
n. These individuals experience a variety of problems, 
including marital and career problems. They also sometimes engage in crime in order to deal with 
the financial problems caused by their excessive gambling. 
 
It is important that any jurisdiction carefu
lly consider these possible impacts prior to 
introducing or expanding legalized gambling. Although there may be obvious benefits from 
casinos, such as job creation and a new source of tax revenues, research confirms that there are 
some social harms that ac
company the economic benefits of casinos. 
 
When considering the economic and social impacts of a casino, we must consider the 
effects of the casino relative to what otherwise would have happened (or what business might have

we must consider whether the observed effects are related to 
economic changes, in general, or are due to the nature of gaming specifically.
 
The experiences in a variety of casino jurisdictions confirm that careful planning is 
important for the success of t
he casino industry. Casinos should be integrated with their 
surrounding communities; they should be introduced in appropriate sizes and numbers for the 
current and potential future markets. The benefits of introducing casinos can be maximized, and 
the nega
tive impacts minimized, if their development and regulation is carefully considered.

Industry
 
As discussed throughout this report, Florida has an extensive gambling industry, 
principally through its
 
state lottery, Native American casinos and pari

mutuel facilities. Each of 
these gambling sectors generates revenue
 
that contribute
s
 
to the Florida economy through tax 
payments, direct employment, indirect employment and induced employment. This chapter of the 
report 
quantifies the economic impact of the industry.

The current 
tax on slot revenue is 35 percent 

, while this is 
imposed on net slot revenue (i.e., net of promotional credits and unclaimed tickets).
552
 
However, 
at inception the applicable tax rate was 50 percent and has since been reduced.
 
In addition to the 
tax on slot revenue, each pari
-
mutuel location having slot machines is subject to $2 million annual 
Slot License Fee, along with an annual $250,000 Compulsive or Addictive Gambling Prevention 
Program Fee.

The following 
chart
 
shows ann
ual revenue due to the state from inception through calendar 
year ended 2012, along with effective tax rate by year (expressed as a percentage of gross and net 
slot revenue).

It is estimated that the equivalent of about 3,000 thoroughbred 
horses reside full

time in Florida and that each horse generates about $25,000 in expenditures, 
resulting in an economic impact of $75 million. Some of those costs include money spent o
n horse 
transport, stall bedding, grooming, and vet services.
555
 
Florida is home to more than 600 t
horoughbred farms and training centers
 
covering 70,000 
acres of land. M
ore than 75 percent of the
 
horse farms are located 
near Ocala in Marion County. 
Ocala is

for thoroughbreds 
throughout the year.
 
It operates a training facility that includes a one

Harness
 
In harness (or standardbred) racing, 
as seen in the following charts
,
 
the purses and number 
of performances 
have 
been relatively steady while the live handle has declined. 
Isle Casino at 
Pompano Park, the only track where h
arness racing takes place, has stopped charging for 
admission.
 
Its 2012 payroll was $19.1 million.
 
Pompano had a payroll of $19.1 million in FY 2012. 
It had an operating profit of $1.9 million but sustained a loss of $2.4 million from its pari
-
mutuel 
opera
tions while it had an operating profit of $4.3 million from slot machines and $90,000 from 
cardroom operations.
558
 
Purses have declined slightly, 
by 0.5
 
percent, from FY 2006 (the last full fiscal year that 
Pompano did not have a casino) to FY 2012. The fail
ure to increase purses has put Pompano in a 
position where it is not competitive with other racino states, Pennachio said, noting that breeding 
has seen a significant reduction in activity. In 2011, there were 40 foals. In 2006, there were 163, 
according t
o 
Joseph Pennachio, president of the Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association.

Quarter Horse
 
Steve Fisch, president of the Florida Quarter Horse Racing Association, reported that more 
than 2,300 horses have raced at Hialeah since it reopened as a quarter h

organization has set up an accredited breeding program with the state Department of Agriculture, 
which rewards Florida
-
bred quarter horses with additional purse awards for finishing anywhere 
from first through fourth in races
. 
 
Already, Florida has seen some significant impact in breeding activity from the return of 
quarter horse racing. The number of starters foaled in the state in 2008 was 24. In 2012, the number 
increased to 96. During the same period, the number of owners of 
starters who reside in Florida 
increased from 68 to 247.
559
 
Each horse contributes nearly $35,000 to the GDP in Florida, 
according to Fisch. Eventually, Fisch expects quarter horse racing to expand to other tracks. The 
result would be year
-
round racing. When
 
and if that happens, he envisions a significant increase 
in breeding activity, handle and purses. Florida, he said, will become one of the top breeding states 
of quarter horses in the country. The number of starters foaled could exceed more than 2,000, he
 
said.
 
Fisch noted that in just a few years, the Florida quarter horse industry 
has gained a 
reputation for quality 
race horses and breeding stock, so much so that owners have begun to export 
mares and stallions to Brazil and Australia. He expects that 
with the expansion of quarter
 
horse
 
racing to other tracks, the export of quarter horses to foreign countries will become a major 
industry.
 
Quarter horse racing returned to Florida in 2010 after a 17
-
year absence. There are limited 
data points from 
1991
-
92, as seen in the following chart
, which is inclusive of barrel racing

Quarter horse racing attracted paid attendance of 
nearly
 
36,000 in each of 1991 and 1992, 
but upon its return in 2010 did not charge for admission. The number
 
of performances

Cardroom laws were changed in 2003 and then again 
in 2010 that encouraged 
professional poker players to play in Florida. The result, as the table shows, was a significant 
increase in gross receipts and tax revenue
. 
Note that the reve

, 2013 Edition
 
The following is excerpted from 

Indian Gaming Industry Report
, 2013 
Edition,
 
and provides an explanation of the taxes and/or payments associated with Native 
American casinos in Florida:
 
In November 2007, the Seminole Tribe and the Governor of Florida entered into a tribal
-
state gaming compact. Upon federal approval in January 2008
, the Tribe began making 
required compact payment to the State. However, the compact was challenged by the State 
Legislature, and in July 2008, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the Governor did not 
have the authority to enter into the Seminole gaming c
ompact without the ratification of 
the State. Following this ruling, the Tribe entered into a new gaming compact with the 
State on April 7, 2010. This compact was ratified by the State Legislature, and became 
effective when published in the Federal Registe
r on July 6, 2010. The 2010 compact calls 
for several types of payments by the Tribe to the State (note that the State also kept all 
payments the Tribe made under the original 2007 compact). The new payments consist of 
(i) annual revenue sharing payments, 
97 percent of which goes to the State and 3 percent 
goes to local governments; (ii) an annual oversight assessment not to exceed $250,000 per 
year (indexed for inflation); and (iii) an annual donation to the Florida Council on 
Compulsive Gambling in the am
ount of not less than $250,000 for each of its seven gaming 
facilities. The revenue sharing payments, which are made in exchange for exclusivity 
within the local region, are as follows in the first five years: Years 1 and 2 

 
$150 million 
per year; Years 3
 
and 4 

 
the greater of $233 million per year or a percentage payment

based on Class III net win (i.e., amounts wagered minus prizes/payouts and free 
play/promotional credits); and Year 5 

 
$234 million or a percentage payment based on 
Class III net win. P
ercentage payments are based on a sliding scale: 12 percent on net win 
up to $2 billion; 15 percent on net win over $2 billion and up to $3 billion; 17.5 percent on 
net win over $3 billion and up to $3.5 billion; 20 percent on net win over $3.5 billion and
 
up to $4 billion; 22.5 percent on net win over $4 billion and up to $4.5 billion; and 25 
percent on net win over $4.5 billion. The Seminole Tribe also makes fixed annual local 
revenue sharing payment
s to the City of Coconut Creek.
 
The same report indicate
d total direct payments in 2011 (from the Seminole Tribe) were 
$154.4 million, of which $147.3 million (or 95.4 percent) was for state revenue sharing.
565
 
We 
note for the most recent fiscal year (ended June 2012) the state collected $150 million in revenue 
s
haring from the Seminole Tribe, of which $3.75 million was distributed to local governments, 
including both counties and municipalities.
566
 
The
 
State subsequently collected $163.8 million 
from the Seminole Tribe in FY 2012 and for FY 2013 through June 15, 20
13, collected $174.8 
million.
 
Any assessment of the economic impact of Indian gaming should also consider the 
alternative: In the absence of this revenue stream, how would tribes such as the Seminoles be able 
to provide necessary services and funding for t
heir families?  Seminole General Counsel Jim Shore 
told Spectrum that the 3,800 members of his tribe would be living in abject poverty with little hope 
of escape.

The Florida Lottery is also one of t

the 
Lottery has provided a total of $24 billion to the EETF.
571
 
In the past fiscal year the EETF has 
allocated $317 million for construction bonds, provided $271 million for public school finding, 
$130 million for state colleges, and $254 million for s
tate universities.
572
 
Since 1997 the
 
Florida 
Lottery
 
has also provided scholarships to more than 600,000 students through the Bright Futures 
Scholarship Program, funded primarily through Lottery financial transfers. These contributions 
yield subsequent resul

impossible to fully quantify yet undeniable 
nonetheless
. 
 
Beyond sales revenue, and transfers to educational assistance the economic impact of the 
Lottery within the state of Florid
a is substantial. The Florida Lottery directly employs 420 full
-
time
-
equivalent employees. The
 
Lottery is 
a critical partner to the widespread sales network of 
13,300 lottery retailers. Most of these retailers are small independent businesses employing 
tho
usands of Florida citizens and providing essential goods and services to local communities. As 
part of 
its
 
recent work with the Massachusetts State Lottery, Spectrum conducted a survey among 
lottery retailers which showed that, on average, each of the 7,40
0 retailers in the Commonwealth 
employs 
two or three
 
people, often at the entry level, in a very wide range of small business 
enterprises.
573
 
From an economic perspective, lottery revenue was estimated by retail sales agents 
to account for a median 25 percen
t of total business revenues.
574
 
In Florida, retail lottery sales are 
generated primarily from convenience stores with gas pumps (48 percent), supermarkets (27 
percent), convenience stores without gas pumps (17 percent), package liquor stores (3 percent), 
sm
all grocery markets (1.5 percent), dollar/discount stores (1 percent), and newsstand/ 
tobacconist/sundries (1 percent).
575
 
With the exception of supermarkets, the great majority of these 
establishments are local small business enterprises

Charitable Bingo
 
As discussed in Chapter II (B)(9
),
 
bingo conducted for charitable purposes is regulated at 
the county or municipal level and no state agency or organization aggregates the gross or net bingo 
revenue. Spectrum is unaware of even credible estimates as to the dollar size of the Florida 
charit
able bingo market. As noted, there is no 
direct 
employment associated with charitable bingo, 
as the activity 
is operated by volunteers who are members of the recipient charity. In the bingo

Combined with data from the County Business Patterns (

CBP

) by the US Census Bureau 
and 
an 
assessment of the gambling industry in Florida by Spectrum, REMI was able to estimate 
the
 
historical
 
and 
current share of the gambling industry within the
 
three
 
aggregate 
sectors. The 
CBP publishes paid
-
employees and payroll data for both 
Gambling Industries (NAICS 7132)
, 
Casino Hotels (NAICS 72112)
,
 
Food and Beverage Stores and Convenience Stores (NAICS 445 
and NAICS 445120, respectively),
 
which 
we categorized
 
as 
subsectors of Amusement, 
G
ambling,
 
and
 
R

I
ndustries
,
 
Accommodation,
 
and Retail Trade,
 
respectively. 
REMI and Spectrum
 
divided the casino gaming industry into 
four
 
main groups: racinos

With this information, we were able to establish the gamblin

three
 
aggregate sectors. This information is essential to 
the following section 
as we carry out a 
counterfactual analysis that involves removing the employment and its associated wages and 
output to determine the total economi
c and fiscal contribution of the gambling industry. The 
gambling industry is unique because it typically has higher labor productivity than its aggregate 
sector. This is evident in the following table, showing the 
Racinos/Pari
-
mutuels
 
employment is 
approxi
mately 2.8
 
percent
 
of the total employment and wage 
and
 
salary in the Amusement, 
Gambling,
 
and
 
Recreation Industries. However, the 
Racinos/Pari
-
mutuels
 
output is 4.4
 
percent
 
of 
the total 
Amusement, Gambling, and Recreation
 
Industries output. We ha
ve
 
to tak
e into account 
this higher labor productivity of the gaming 
sub
sector
s
 
when we do the counterfactual analysis. 
 
The Casino Hotels shows a similar pattern
,
 
in which
 
the employment a
nd associated 
compensation make
 
up about 5.5
 
percent
 
of the Accommodation se
ctor, but its output is over 10
 
percent
 
of the Accommodation output. 
 
The Lottery sector (excluding retailers) has uniquely high labor productivity due to its 
operation design. Lottery revenues make up nearly 38 percent of the Amusement, Gambling, and 
Recr

Amusement, Gambling, and Recreation Industries. Typically, a lottery control board oversees the 
operation and sells lottery tickets through sales agents (retailer
s). Once the lottery operation is 
established, the administrative cost remains largely the same. The marginal cost for producing an 
additional dollar of lottery sales is very low compared to other goods and services, hence the high 
productivity. That being
 
said, in this report we do not adjust for labor productivity in the Lottery 
sector because the entirety of lottery sales (after prize payouts) transfers to state revenues. Instead, 
we remove the net lottery sales through the revenue module in Tax
-
PI to pe
rform the counterfactual 
analysis for the Lottery sector.
 
Spectrum has studied the lottery business model in multiple states, including its retail 
distribution model. We noted the following in a 2012 report for the Massachusetts State Lottery:
 
Many sales agents are first
-
generation immigrants to the United States. They view retailing 
in general, and the Lottery in particular, as important rungs on the ladder toward economic 
success and independence. 

While we suspect that the present Lottery di
stribution system 
was not designed as an economic ladder for retailers and their families, it has nonethele
ss 
evolved into precisely that.
579
 
The Retail Lottery sector, on the other hand, behaves differently than the Lottery sector. 
According to 

012 Lottery Almanac
,
580
 
over 95 percent of the lottery sales occur at gas 
stations with convenience stores, standalone convenience stores, supermarkets, and liquor stores. 
These businesses primarily engage in providing other goods and services aside from the
 
lottery. 
Lottery sales are a supplement to these businesses, and commission on lottery ticket sales makes

up only a fraction of their total revenue, which would explain why lottery sales make up just 0.3 
percent of the output of the Retail Trade industry.

Discussion of Components of Economic and Fiscal Impacts
 
A description of the direct, indirect, and 
induced components of the economic and fiscal impact of each 
of the subsectors. Impacts associated with facility construction should be distinguished from impacts 
associated with ongoing operation of a facility.
 
Using the employment, output, wage 
and
 
salary, tax revenue, and regulatory costs data 
from Chapter III(A) above, we performed a counterfactual analysis using the REMI Tax
-
PI model 
to evaluate the contribution of the gambling industry as it existed in Florida in 2012. For this 
modeling effort, 

Global Insight June 2013 Control Forecast, a state benchmark based upon population estimates 

 
September 2012 US BEA historical ES
-
202 data in order to correctly calibrate model baseline. 
EDR also provided REMI its latest customized budget for Tax
-
PI to ensure the fiscal module of 
the Tax
-
PI is properly calibrated. 
 
To create a customized budget in
 
Tax
-
PI, a user begins by including at least one year of 
revenue and expenditure into the budget. EDR included its FY 2013 budget data for its current 
Tax
-
PI model. Next, each revenue item must be assigned an economic indicator. For Indian 
Gaming revenue, 
EDR established a time series forecasting the growth of the revenue. For pari
-
mutuel fees, licenses, and taxes, EDR elected to drive the revenue forecast by the demand of the 
Amusement, Gambling, and Recreation Industries. The slot machine fees, licenses, 
and taxes 
revenue forecast is also driven the by the demand of the Amusement, Gambling, and Recreation 
Industries. Lastly, EDR chose to use personal consumption expenditure on gambling to drive the 
lottery revenue forecast. 
 
The user can choose whether the
 
expenditures will be determined by revenues or demand. 


categories to each o
f the expenditure categories. It specified the percentage of each revenue source 
that is associated with each expenditure category. For example, EDR has 77.8 percent of the lottery 
revenue mapped to education expenditures and the remaining 22.2 percent is 
mapped to general 
government spending. All revenue sources must be mapped to expenditure categories, so by 
definition the sum of all expenditures will equal the sum of all revenues. (For further information 
about the methodology of the Tax
-
PI model, please
 
see Appendix II.)
 
The REMI model forecasts the economy out to 2060 to allow analysts to evaluate any 
changes to the baseline. The gambling industry is already presented in the baseline forecast 
because it is a component in the current Florida economy. In 
this study, we are not trying to 
measure the contribution of the gambling industry 
on top of
 
the existing gambling activities in the 
Florida baseline. Rather, the objective is to understand the impacts of the gambling 
as it exists 
currently
. In other words
, what are the impacts to Florida if the gambling industry did not exist? 
Employing the counterfactual requires that we

state gaming spending
 
to simulate th
e loss of 
the gambling industry in Florida. This approach allows us to measure the direct, indirect, and 
induced contribution of the existing gambling industry to the overall economy in 2012.
 
It is also important to consider the substitution effect of gami
ng spending in this 
counterfactual analysis. If households did not spend on gam
bl
ing
-
related expenses, this spending 
would not simply disappear from the economy. Rather, we assume 
these consumers
 
would have 
spent 
those dollars
 
on other goods and services. In this analysis
,
 
we assume 95 percent of the GGR 
to the pari
-
mutuel casinos was from Florida residents, 85 percent of Native American casino
 
GGR
 
was from Florida residents, and 98 percent of total lottery sales were from Flor
ida residents. The 
full amount of GGR attributable to Florida residents is available for redistribution to various 
consumption categories.
 
However, some of this money will also leak out of the state due to 

 
activities. The following few pages outline the 
methodology used to account for the substitution effects.
 
To estimate how much Floridians would be spending in other gaming markets were casinos 
not available in Florida, we look back to data from 2005, prio
r to the authorization of racinos and 
Class III gaming. According to 

,
 
the percentage of adults who gambled at least once in a casino in the 
previous
 
12 months (or in 
2005) was approximately 25.2 
percent.
581
 
Importantly, this figure includes all 
of 
the US adult 
population 

 
those who lived nearby to casinos, as well as those who did not. 
 
According to the 

, of the top 20 largest feeder markets (to casinos) in the 
US, three were in Flor
ida
:
 
Miami
-
Ft. Lauderdale, Tampa
-
St. Petersburg
-
Sarasota, and Orlando
-
Daytona Beach
-
Melbourne.
582
 
These three areas were aggregated by Designated Market Area 

, a term that generally refers to media markets,
 

an
d approximately two
-

participation rate in Florida for these three DMAs, and aggregated, was approximately 23.1 percent 
in 2005 

 
as illustrated in the following table.

Importantly, although this period was before the expansion of casinos in Florida, we do see 
that the Miami

Ft. Lauderdale DMA had a much higher casino participation rate than the other 
two DMAs in Florida, as well as a rate higher than the 
national average.

Fast forward to 2012, 
by w
hich time
 
the US casino landscape 
had 
expanded considerably
. 
The 
reported US casino participation rate was 32 percent
 
and
 
overall GGR at casinos (both 
commercial and Native American) was approximately $65 billion.
586
 
This total GGR divided by 
number of adults who were active gamblers translates into 
average annual
 
GGR of $904 per casino 
gambler in 2012.
 
If we assume that slots at
 
Florida
 
pari
-
mutuels would not exist today, 
and that
 

Native American casinos re
mained limited to Class II operations, and we apply the 2005 casino 
participation rate to the estimated 2012 number of adults in Florida, this would translate into 
approximately 2.96 million active casino gamblers in Florida in 2012. Further applying the U
S 
average GGR per casino gambler (of $904 in 2012) to Florida gamblers yields $2.67 billion of 
GGR (casino only) that we believe could have been reasonably generated by Florida adults in 
2012. Assuming 
the 
status
 
quo for Native American casinos in Florida 
(i.e., GGR remains at 2005 
level for 2012), this translates into $1.514 billion of potential GGR that we assume would have 
been exported out
 
of
 
state in the absence of Florida racinos or Class III casinos.
 
W
e estimated that approximately $500 million of GG
R is already being exported to other 
states by Floridians
 
(
see Chapter III[B][1]
)
, so we can assume that $1 billion in additional out
-
of
-
state gambling by Florida adults would occur annually in the absence 
of racinos or Class III 
casinos.
 
We believe it is 
reasonable that casinos along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, as well as 
those in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and the Bahamas/Caribbean, 
would be
 
the primary beneficiaries 
of this GGR stream from Florida adults.
 
In addition to out
-
of
-
state gambling spending, 
residents would have other gambling
-
trip
-
related spending as well. 
If we assume that Floridians would be gambling more out
 
of
 
state in the 
absence of Florida casinos, we can also assume that the overwhelming majority would be flying 
to distant destinations
. (For the Floridians who drive to casinos in nearby states, those out
 
of
 
state 
casinos would largely still be the most convenient option.)
 
With that in mind, we suggest the following would account for additional non
-
gaming 
spending that would accompany su
ch visits by air. These estimates are based on the most recent 
visitor profile published by the Las Vegas Convention & Visitors Authority,
587
 
which we suggest 
would reflect spending patterns in other distant locales as well. These would be, in addition to 
ga
mbling budgets, dollars that would not be spent in Florida:

Of our estimated GGR for Florida in 2012 (
assuming
 
there were no casinos in Florida aside 

border (based on our aforementioned in
-
state vs. out
-
of
-
state split) and further apportion our 
estimated 2.96 million
 
Florida gamblers accordingly, we would yield 1.675 million gamblers who 
would have gambled outside of Florida. Assuming one
-
half of these Florida adults who gambled 
out
 
of
 
state would have mimicked the non
-
gaming spending as indicated (based on Las Vegas 
in 
2012), we would yield $1.227 billion of non
-
gaming spending 

 
this is spending associated with 
the $1 billion of GGR that would have been exported from Florida in the absence of racinos or 
Class III casinos. The non
-
gaming spending exceeds the gaming sp
ending in this scenario largely 
because of the additional cost of airfare, lodging, meals and other attractions that would occur 
under such a scenario.
 
From the above sections
,
 
we find that the total amount of money that would leave Florida 
in the absence 
of 
Class III and racino 
gambling opportunities is $2.227 billion. This total amount 
is then split in two for the purposes of entry into Tax
-
PI. Since pari
-
mutuels and racinos are 
modeled separately from 
Native American
 
casinos, the out
-
of
-
state spending mu
st be apportioned 
appropriately among the two sectors. We used the proportion of GGR of each sector to allocate 
the total spending. This spending is then used to offset the reallocation of consumer dollars that 
would be freed in the absence of gaming. More
 
specifically, if gambling opportunities were no 
longer available
,
 
then the money that Floridians spent on those activities would become available 
for other purposes. One of those purposes is out
-
of
-
state gambling and related expenditures. The 
remainder is
 
assumed to be spent on the normal basket of goods and services of a Florida resident.
 
It is worth noting that the lottery scenario does not receive an allocation of the out
-
of
-
state 
spending. This assumption is based on the nature of participating in lott

state compared to traveling to popular gambling destination and participating in all the activities 
available. In short, in the absence o
f a state lottery program we do not
 
assume that 
significant
 
numbers of Floridians would travel out
-
of
-
state to participate in 
other 
lotte
ries, 
so in this scenario 
the consumption reallocation goes entirely to other in
-
state spending.
 
 
We selected five policy variables for the counterfactual simulations: Industry E
mployment; 
Industry Sales without Employment, Investment, and Compensation; Wage Bill; Compensation; 
and Consumption Reallocation. 
 
The Industry Employment variable allows us to remove the total number of direct jobs in 
the gambling industry (recall that t
his is a 
counterfactual
 
analysis, so we reduce the amount of 
  
 
Florida Gaming Study, Part 1

254
 
 
employment instead of adding to it); the Industry Sales without Employment, Investment, and 
Compensation variable is used to account for the higher labor productivity in the gambling industry 
in 
comparison to the Amusement, Gambling, and Recreation
 
Industries
 
and Accommodation 
sectors; the Wage Bill variable is used to adjust the wage & salary differences between the 
gambling industry and its aggregate sectors; and the Compensation variable is use
d to adjust the 
compensation differences between the gambling industry and its aggregate sectors; and the 
Consumption Reallocation variable is used to capture the spending of Floridians on gambling 
outside of Florida and to capture the substitution effect 
of gaming spending within Florida. 
 
The tax revenue of each gaming subsector is taken out directly through the revenue module 
in Tax
-
PI. Regulatory costs for pari
-
mutuels are not explicitly modeled in Tax
-
PI because the fees 
paid by pari
-
mutuels fund the c
osts. When we eliminate the direct tax revenue and fees collected 
from pari
-
mutuels, we also eliminate the expenditure (e.g., regulatory costs) associated with the 
revenue
. 
 
 
Note in the following tables that the values for employment, wage, compensation, 
and 
productivity adjustments are 
negative
 
because this is what we are removing from the economy; 
the reallocation amount is positive because it represents the substitution effect of money spent on 
other goods and services if it were not spent on gambling:

Where negative induced

job figures are noted throughout this economic analysis (i.e., in t
he average 
annual Local Consumption Demand Employment
, which is the main component of induced employment), this is 
primari
ly because for every dollar 
Floridians spend
 
on 
a gambling sector
, it means a dollar less they can spend 
elsewhere. 
Households have
 
a fixed amount of disposable income and this negative number represents the jobs

exhibits the total economic and fiscal impacts generated from the existence of 
the lottery sector in 2012. The lottery 
sector (excluding retailers) 
supports a total of 
12,490
 
jobs in 
Florida. The associated GSP is $
860
 
m
illion and it generated $
727
 
millio
n in personal income. 
The tax revenue generated from the direct, indirect, and induced impacts of the lottery in FY 2013 
is $1.88 billion.
 
As mentioned previously, the lottery revenue is linked to education expenditures, 
thus any changes to the lottery rev
enue will affect government jobs in Florida.
 
Out of the total 
12,490 jobs, 9,926 of them are government employment in 2012
.

The Exogenous Industry Sales Emplo

also be interpreted as the direct input we entered into the model. The direct retail lottery 
employment impact is 39,900 jobs in 2012, and the 
indirect e
mployment (Intermediate Demand 
Employment
) supported by the retail lottery sector is 4,206. The induced employment (sum of 
Local Consumption Demand, Government Demand, Investment Activity Demand, and Exports 
Demand Employment) impact as a result of the retail lottery industry is 14,042. 
Income cr
eated 
through both direct and indirect employment is spent on consumer goods, which supports 
employment in industries providing these goods and services (typically retail and restaurants). 
These jobs are referred to as Local Consumption Demand Employment i
n the REMI model. 
The 
sum of the direct, indirect, and induced employment is 58,146.

State Gaming Spending
 
Spectrum estimates that casinos along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi a
nd in Alabama, as 
well as those in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, are generating at least $411 million of GGR from 
Florida residents annually. Additionally, there are hundreds of other casinos in the US and a short 
distance away in the Bahamas and Caribbean 
islands that Florida residents are visiting (and 
exporting GGR 
during such visits
). Therefore, we believe it is well within reason that at least $500 
million of GGR annually is being generated at casinos outside of Florida by Florida residents.

Assessment of Economic, Fiscal Impacts over Time
 
An assessment of the changes in those impacts over time until the present day, historically, 
and 
projections for the future.
 
For this section, we employed the same policy variables as 
in
 
Chapter III(B) above and ran 
a counterfactual analysis for years 201
2 through 2060 to observe the impacts of the 
existing
 
gambling industry over time. In addition, we established two alternative national forecasts: one 
with 5 percent slower economic growth and the other with 5 percent stronger economic growth, 
relative to 
the state benchmark baseline in the model. The new national forecasts generated new 
regional forecasts for Florida. We then ran the same set of inputs against the three regional 
forecasts to quantify the impacts of the gambling industry under different eco
nomic trajectories. 
 
REMI and Spectrum assume that, over time, the employment in the overall existing 
gambling industry will expand at half the growth rate of its aggregate sectors in the REMI model. 
Given the regulations and restrictions imposed on the ga
mbling industry, it is difficult to justify 
that the industry can expand at the same rate as a typical entertainment/recreation, retail trade, or 
accommodation industry. On the other hand, assuming no growth in the next 50 years is an 
excessively conservat
ive assumption. We believe it is reasonable to choose a growth rate in 
between the two extremes. We assume wages and labor productivity will both grow at the same 
rate as the respective aggregate sector. 
 
The following are tables showing the forecasted emp
loyment, output, wage and 
salary/compensation, and consumption reallocation for each of the gambling subsectors.

As mentioned 
previously, the lottery revenues are linked

Florida.
 
Out of the average annual 28,205 jobs between 2012 and 2060, 23,430 of them are

The job numbers in REMI are not cumulative. If the job impact is 5,000 in 2012 and 4,000 in 2013, we 
cannot conclude that the total job impact in 2012 and 2013 is 9,000 because the 4,000 jobs in 2013 can be the 
s
ame jobs from 2012. Therefore, we compute an annual average when we evaluate long

Between 2012 and 2060
, the lottery 
sector (excluding retailers)
 
is projected to support an 
annual average
 
of 
28,690 
jobs in 
Florida
 
under normal economic growth assumption
s

cumulative GSP is $
119.3
 
billion and 
personal income is
 
$

The 
average annual 
tax 
revenues generated from the direct, indirect, and induced impacts of the lottery industry 
between
 
FY 2013 
and
 
FY 2
060 are
 
$
3.56
 
billion. 
As mentioned previously, the lottery revenues are linked 
to education expenditures, thus any changes to the lottery revenues will affect government jobs in 
Florida.
 
Therefore, the lottery sector also supports an average annual of 
23,501 government jobs 
between 2012 and 2060.
 
Out of the average annual 28,690 jobs between 2012 and 2060, 24,058 
of them are government employment.

Similar to the previous section, we modeled the construction of Hialeah Park separately 
from the gambling industry assessment. Instead of modeling the impact of construction for only 
2012, h
owever, we modeled the construction activity in its entirety, starting in 2011 and ending in 
2013, under the assumption that the construction duration is 24 months starting in summer of 2011.

Conclusion
 
This analysis examines the gambling industry and its economic and fiscal contribution to 

Economic Ba

(racinos/pari
-
mutuels, lottery, and Native American casinos) account for only a fraction of 
employment and wages within its respective aggregate sector, they are highly producti
ve industries 
and generate a considerable amount of direct economic output to Florida. 
 
In addition, the gaming industry has consistently brought revenue for the State of Florida 
historically. Below is tax collection information from FY 2000:

B. 
Discussion of Components of Economic and Fiscal 

examines the total economic and fiscal impacts of the gambling industry by subsector in 2012. The 
analysis of the existing gambling industry reveals the nature of each of the subsectors in a snapshot 
in time. This snapshot tells us how many jobs 
exist in each subsector, how it uses intermediate 
inputs, and how the reallocation of consumer dollars toward it impacts the economy. The direct 
jobs show the employment in each subsector. The indirect jobs are those that result from business
-
to
-
business s
ales. In other words, the indirect jobs show us the total supply chain impacts of the 
change in business activity.
 
Finally, perhaps the one result that stands out the most is 
in 
induced employment. It mainly 
shows the change in the number of jobs supported
 
by local consumption. We know that households

have a fixed budget
,
 
so every consumption decision implies the foregoing of an alternative 
purchase. Specifically in this case, if households allocate part of their budget toward gambling 
then they must forego
 
other consumption. 
Much of the foregone spending is assumed to be from 
gambling out of state. 
The negative induced employment numbers mainly represent jobs that 
household spending could have supported if spending on gambling were not available. It should 
be noted that induced employment includes other categories which are noted in the body of the 
report but in these simulations are quite small in relation to local consumption demand.
 
The 
next 
five 
charts
 
show the changes in tax revenue resulting from the counterfactual 
scenarios that REMI ran under the three different growth sc
enarios. All scenarios, except R
etail 
L
ottery, display a similar shape due to the calibration of the underlying ta

PI. As 
stated earlier, REMI used the budget provided by EDR in order to be consistent with the work 
already being done in Florida.

Analysis. 
That forecast is driving the results up to

revenue 
drives the 
forecast for the 
remainder of the analysis period
.
 
The change between the different methods employed by EDR 
can be seen 
in the graphs in the transitional year of 2025
-
2026. EDR also built in the revenue 
effects of the expiration of the gaming compact with the Seminole
 
Tribe
 
in 2015. Lastly, the reason 
that the 
R
etail L
ottery scenario does not have the bump in 2025 is that there 
are no direct tax 
revenue changes as part of the simulation inputs unlike in the other four sectors.

reveals them to be largely the same, which is due
 
to
 
the nature of the simulations. A key point to 
remember is that the simulation inputs do not change under the various growth assumptions, 
mea
ning that we are applying the same shock to three different national economic bases. Any 
divergence in the results is due to differences in how the same shock ripples through the three 
economies.
 
Structurally, we notice that the average results over the 49
-
year period resemble the 
snapshot in 2012. The fundamental makeup of these sectors is not expected to change significantly 
over the forecast horizon. Therefore, we do not expect to see large variation
s
 
in the relationship 
between direct, indirect, and ind
uced employment. We see more negative induced employment 
numbers than in the 2012 snapshot. That difference is due to the growth of in
-
state gambling 
spending relative to out
-
of
-
state spending
.
 
An interesting result is seen in the comparison of the same re
sult over the three growth 
scenarios. We can see that the results tend to be biggest in the slow scenario and smallest in the 
strong scenario. This can seem counter
-
intuitive. We have previously established that the inputs 
are the same in each simulation a
nd, so, any differences are due to ripple effects, not direct inputs. 
So why would the ripple effects be smaller in the strong growth case? The answer boils down to 
the available slack in the economy. In a slower economy, additional labor is more readily a
vailable 
and costs and prices are lower. These factors mean that the same shock in a slightly weaker 
economy will have greater job, income, consumption, and business activity impacts, as there would 
be fewer constraints to growth.

Tax
-
PI is a new tool for evaluating the total fiscal and economic effects of tax 
policy changes. Tax
-
PI is based on over 30 years of experience in modeling the economic effects 
of tax policy changes. As states begin to de
mand better methods for estimating the economic and 
fiscal impacts of alternative tax scenarios, they look to experts to respond with sophisticated, 
flexible and relevant tools that can meet their needs.
 
Tax
-
PI is a dynamic fiscal and economic impact model
 
that captures the direct, indirect 
and induced fiscal and economic effects of taxation and other policy changes over multiple years 
(up to 2060). It can model the complete dynamic economic and demographic impacts of any 
manner of tax policy change. States
 
need to thoroughly evaluate both the short
-
 
and long
-
term 
effects of any tax changes in order to best serve the needs of the people. Tax
-
PI allows state 
agencies to do this with a model backed by years of dependability and experience. Highlights 
include
 

 
B
udget Editor: Customizable table that users calibrate to reflect actual or projected 
revenue and expenditure details for the current, past or future fiscal years.
 

 
Taxes: Dynamic capability to adjust state
-
specific tax revenues. Users assign tax
-
specific va
riables to each of the custom revenue categories in order to track the fiscal 
effects of policy changes along with the economic effects. There is also a built
-
in 
feedback mechanism that automatically feeds revenue impacts back into the model to 
account for
 
price and disposable income changes, therefore adjusting government 
spending accordingly.

PI Structure
 
 
As Figure 1

shows, the methodology of Tax
-
PI revolves around the estimation of 
dynamic economic impacts. These impacts serve as the basis for the estimation of budgetary 

us
ed a budget calibrated by Tax
-
PI users at the Office of Economic and Demographic Research. 
Prior to running simulations, the newest available year of revenue data is used to calibrate the 
budget. Each category is individually entered into Tax
-
PI. Then each
 
revenue source is assigned 
an economic driver from the dynamic impact model that will form the basis of future estimates of 
the amount of revenue gained from that particular source. For example, the amount of sales tax 
revenue collected is connected to th
e amount of consumption in taxable categories in the state in 
that year as given by Tax
-

pieces of information (collections and driver), Tax
-
PI creates a quantified relationship between the 
tw
o that can then predict changes in the future. A similar process is carried out for each revenue 
source. In Florida, the expenditures are mapped to specific revenue categories so the amount of 
government spending is tied to the availability of applicable r
evenues.
 
Detailed Model Methodology
 
 
Tax
-
PI 
is a structural economic forecasting and policy analysis model
. 
It integrates input
-
output, computable general equilibrium, econometric and economic geography methodologies
. 
The model is dynamic, with forecasts a
nd simulations generated on an annual basis and behavioral 
responses to compensation, price, and other economic factors.
 
The model consists of thousands of simultaneous equations with a structure that is 
relatively straightforward
. 
The exact number of equa
tions used varies depending on the extent of

. 
The overall 
structure of the model can be summarized in five major blocks:  (1) Output and Demand, (2) Labor 
and Capital Demand, 
(3) Population and Labor Supply, (4) Compensation, Prices, and Costs, and 
(5) Market Shares. The blocks and their key int
eractions are shown in

The Output and Demand block consists of output, demand, consumption, investment, 
government spending, exports, and imports, as well as feedback from output change due to the 
change in the productivity of intermediate inputs
. 
The Labor and Capital Demand block includes 
labor intensity and productivity as well as demand for labor and capital
. 
Labor force participation 
rate and migration equations are in the Population and Labor Supply block
. 
The Compensation, 
Prices, and Costs
 
block includes composite prices, determinants of production costs, the 
consumption price deflator, housing prices, and the compensation equations
. 
The proportion of 
local, inter
-
regional, and export markets captured by each region is included in the Marke
t Shares 
block.
 
Single
-
region models consist of an individual region, called the home region
. 
The rest of 
the nation is also represented in the model. However, since the home region is only a small part of 
the total nation, the changes in the region do not
 
have an endogenous effect on the variables in the 
rest of the nation.

Block 1. Output and Demand
 
This block includes output, demand, consumption, investment, government spending, 
import, commodity access, and export concepts
. 
Output fo
r each industry in the home region is 

and international exports from the region.
 
For each industry, demand is determined by the amount of output, 
consumption, 
investment, and capital demand on that industry
. 
Consumption depends on real disposable income 
per capita, relative prices, differential income elasticities, and population
. 
Input productivity 
depends on access to inputs because a larger choic
e set of inputs means it is more likely that the 
input with the specific characteristics required for the job will be found
. 
In the capital stock 
adjustment process, investment occurs to fill the difference between optimal and actual capital 
stock for resi
dential, non
-
residential, and equipment investment
. 
Government spending changes 
are determined by changes in the population.
 
Block 2
. 
Labor and Capital Demand
 
 
The Labor and Capital Demand block includes the determination of 
labor productivity, 
labor intensity, and the optimal capital stocks
. 
Industry
-
specific labor productivity depends on the 
availability of workers with differentiated skills for the occupations used in each industry
. 
The 
occupational labor supply and commuti

to a specialized labor 
force.
 
Labor intensity is determined by the cost of labor relative to the other factor inputs, capital 
and fuel
. 
Demand for capital is driven by the optimal capital stock equation for both non
-
residen
tial 
capital and equipment
. 
Optimal capital stock for each industry depends on the relative cost of labor 
and capital, and the employment weighted by capital use for each industry
. 
Employment in private 
industries is determined by the value added and emplo
yment per unit of value added in each 
industry.
 
Block 3
. 
Population and Labor Supply
 
The Population and Labor Supply block includes detailed demographic information about 
the region
. 
Population data is given for age, gender
, and race, with birth and survival rates for each 
group
. 
The size and labor force participation rate of each group determines the labor supply
. 
These 
participation rates respond to changes in employment relative to the potential labor force and to 
changes
 
in the real after
-
tax compensation rate
. 
Migration includes retirement, military, 
international, and economic migration
. 
Economic migration is determined by the relative real 
after
-
tax compensation rate, relative employment opportunity, and consumer acces
s to variety.

Block 4
. 
Compensation, Prices and Costs
 
This block includes delivered prices, production costs, equipment cost, the consumption 
deflator, consumer prices, the price of housing, and the compensation equation
. 
Econ
omic 
geography concepts account for the productivity and price effects of access to specialized labor, 
goods, and services.
 
These prices measure the price of the industry output, taking into account the access to 
production locations
. 
This access is import
ant due to the specialization of production that takes 
place within each industry, and because transportation and transaction costs
 
of distance are 
significant
. 
Composite prices for each industry are then calculated based on the production costs 
of supplyi
ng regions, the effective distance to these regions, and the index of access to the variety 
of outputs in the industry relative to the access
 
by other uses of the product.
 
The cost of production for each industry is determined by the cost of labor, capital
, fuel, 
and intermediate inputs
. 
Labor costs reflect a productivity adjustment to account for access to 
specialized labor, as well as underlying compensation rates
. 
Capital costs include costs of non
-
residential structures and equipment, while fuel costs i
ncorporate electricity, natural gas, and 
residual fuels.
 
The consumption deflator converts industry prices to prices for consumption commodities
. 
For potential migrants, the consumer price is additionally calculated to include housing prices
. 
Housing price
s change from their initial level depending on changes in income and population 
density.
 
Compensation changes are due to changes in labor demand and supply conditions and 
changes in the national compensation rate
. 
Changes in employment opportunities relati
ve to the 
labor force and occupational demand change determine compensation rates by industry.
 
Block 5
. 
Market Shares
 
 
The market shares equations measure the proportion of local and export markets that are 
captured by each industry
. 
These depend on relative production costs, the estimated price elasticity 
of demand, and the effective distance between the home region and each of the other regions
. 
The 
change in share of a specific area in any region depends on changes in its delivered 
price and the 
quantity it produces compared with the same factors for competitors in that market
. 
The share of 
local and external markets then drives the exports from and imports to the home economy.
