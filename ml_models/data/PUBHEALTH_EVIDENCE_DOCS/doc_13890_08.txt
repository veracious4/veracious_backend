 The journal emphasizes the application of epidemiologic methods to issues that affect the &lt;strong&gt;distribution&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;determinants &lt;/strong&gt;of &lt;strong&gt;human illness&lt;/strong&gt; in diverse contexts.
 Its primary focus is on &lt;strong&gt;chronic &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;acute &lt;/strong&gt;conditions of diverse etiologies and of major importance to clinical medicine, public health, and health care delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\n\\n&lt;em&gt;Annals &lt;/em&gt;encourages the use of &lt;strong&gt;epidemiology &lt;/strong&gt;in a multidisciplinary approach to understanding &lt;strong&gt;disease etiology&lt;/strong&gt;.
