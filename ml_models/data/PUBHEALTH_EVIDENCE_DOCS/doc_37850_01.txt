ULTA,   +0.35%   announced Wednesday that it intends to furlough its retail workers as of April 19 due to the spread of COVID-19.
 "After thoughtful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to temporarily furlough many of our store and salon associates," Chief Executive Mary Dillon said in the announcement.
 Dillon will forego her base salary and has personally donated $500,000 to the Ulta Beauty Associate Relief Program, which will assist employees facing personal hardship from the coronavirus.
 Ulta continues to offer online sales, and is paying workers in its distribution centers an additional $2 an hour.
 The company also said it plans to donate 450,000 medical-grade gloves from its salons to hospitals nationwide in coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
