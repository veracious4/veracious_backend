 I’m so happy to have gotten one of these beautiful little friends.

 Purchased item:       Large Fiber Sculpture- Automeris io moth        cesargarciatapia 16 Jul, 2020         5 out of 5 stars                 The butterfly took almost 4 months to arrive to Spain, because of the pandemic, and Yumi was always helpful, keeping me constantly posted about what was going on with the package.
 She is a really caring and kind person.
 And, of course, the butterfly itself is gorgeus, and was perfectly wrapped.
