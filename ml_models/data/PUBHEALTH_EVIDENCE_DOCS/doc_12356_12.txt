 The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database provides a large cohort of lung transplant (LTx) recipients in which to evaluate the effect of insurance on survival.
 Methods:           We retrospectively reviewed UNOS data for 11,385 adult primary LTx patients (1998-2008).
 Patients were stratified by insurance (private/self-pay, Medicare, Medicaid, and other type).
 The Kaplan-Meier method was used to model survival after LTx.
 Results:           Of 11,385 recipients, 7,100 (62.4%) had private insurance/self-pay; 2,966 (26.1%) had Medicare; 815 (7.2%) had Medicaid; and 504 (4.4%) had other type insurance.
 During the study, 4,943 patients (43.4%) died.
 Medicare and Medicaid patients had 7.0% and 8.1% lower 10-year survival than did private insurance/self-pay patients, respectively.
 Insurance did not affect 30-day, 90-day, or 1-year survival.
 Medicare and Medicaid patients had decreased survival at 3 years and longer.
 When deaths in the first year were excluded, survival differences persisted.
 Conclusions:           This study represents the largest cohort evaluating the effect of insurance on post-LTx survival.
 Medicare and Medicaid patients have worse survival after LTx compared with private insurance/self-paying patients.
