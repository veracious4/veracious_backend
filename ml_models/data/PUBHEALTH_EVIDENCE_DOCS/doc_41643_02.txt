2 Departmental Overview: Department of Health | © National Audit Of˜ce 2016 
 | DP Ref: 11236-001Executive summaryThis Departmental Overview looks at the 
Department of Health (the Department) 

and summarises its performance during 

the year ended March 2016, together 

with our recent reports on it. The content 

of the report has been shared with the 

Department to ensure that the evidence 

presented is factually accurate.
Part One
 Œ The Department: Structure, 
funding and performance
Ł The Department acts as steward to the 

health system, which has a complex 

delivery and accountability structure.
Ł There was no major change to the 

Department in 2015-16, but after 

2015-16 it will be implementing a 

new operating model, which aims to 

reduce administrative spend of the 

core˚Department by about one-third 

during this Parliament.
Ł In 2015-16 the total Departmental budget 

was £149.5 billion. Of this, £118 billion 

was DEL spending (broadly, spending 

that the government argues can be 

controlled rather than driven by demand), 

the vast majority of which is incurred by 

healthcare commissioners and providers.
Ł The NHS received increased funding 

in the 2015 spending review to deliver 

its Five Year Forward View, which sets 

out a new direction for the service. The 

settlement assumes that the NHS will 

deliver £22 billion of efficiency savings.
Ł Demand for services and activity 

continued to grow in 2015-16, while 

performance against service standards 

came under strain.
Part Two
 Œ Findings: Financial audit and 
value-for-money work
Ł The Comptroller and Auditor General 

(C&AG) certified the Department accounts 

with an unqualified audit opinion. 
Ł In the light of the financial and 

performance challenges facing the 

Department, he took the unusual step 

of producing a report on accounts. 

The report highlighted the specific 

steps the Department took to ensure 

it stayed within its voted budget and 

drew attention to the potential impact of 

the Department™s continued transfer of 

capital to revenue funding.
Ł Many of our value-for-money reports focus 

on financial and service sustainability, 

highlighting the challenges that central and 

local bodies have to meet. Governance 

and accountability mechanisms must 

also evolve to meet new developments in 

the sector. Our reports also cover users™ 

experiences of services, including the 

progress towards more integrated health 

and social care services.
Part Three
 Œ Looking ahead
Ł The Department continues to work 

towards implementing the Five Year 

Forward View, but achieving the level 

of efficiency savings it has promised 

to make will be difficult. There is a new 

planning approach for providers to deliver 

the Forward View, alongside increasing 

central intervention to secure financial 

and operational performance. Increasing 

devolution will change accountability and 

funding structures across health and 

social care.
Ł The vote to leave the European Union may 

also have implications for the health and 

social care sector, in the areas of staffing; 

access and charging for treatment; and 

regulations in areas such as working time 

or procurement and competition law.

 | DP Ref: 11236-001The Department will be changing its 
operating model and reducing administrative 

spend by one-third by 2020
There was no major change to the Department in 
2015
-16, but since the end of 2015-16 there have 
been˚a˚number of changes:
Ł In May 2016 Chris Wormald (formerly Permanent 

Secretary at the Department for Education) took over 

from Dame Una O™Brien as Permanent Secretary.
Ł The Department is implementing a new operating 

model through its 
change programme
 (DH2020). 
The˚Department has completed its organisational 

design work, reducing administrative spend by 

around one-third over the course of the Parliament, 

and is currently implementing its new structures 

and˚ways of working.
Ł As part of DH2020, the Department announced a 

new, more streamlined senior structure (from 1 July 

2016), amalgamating responsibilities and reducing 

the seven previous directorates to four.
Other major changes in the health sector in the same 

period included:
Ł Monitor, the NHS Trust Development Authority and 

a number of smaller bodies became a jointly led 

organisation, 
NHS Improvement
, on 1 April 2016. 
NHS Improvement is responsible for overseeing 

foundation trusts and NHS trusts, as well as 

independent providers that provide NHS-funded 

care, and providing support and interventions 

where˚necessary.
Ł Most clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) took on 

greater responsibility for commissioning GP services 

as part of the co-commissioning agenda (previously 

NHS England commissioned such services 

nationally). This is part of plans to move towards 

better, joined-up health commissioning and more 

integrated care for patients.
Ł The Health and Social Care Information Centre, 

which provides information, data and IT systems 

across health and social care, changed its trading 

name to NHS Digital in April 2016.

The vast majority of

The Department is 
accountable
 to 
Parliament for the proper stewardship 
of the resources allocated to it. This 

includes ensuring that all the expenditure 

of the Department, its arm™s-length 

bodies and the NHS (including NHS 

Trusts and NHS Foundation Trusts) is 

contained within the overall budget. It 

must also provide assurance that the 

individual organisations within the system 

are performing effectively and have the 

necessary governance and controls to 

ensure regularity, propriety and value 

for money. The Department does not 

directly spend the vast majority of its 

funding, but instead provides funding 

to its arm™s-length bodies; those bodies 

are then responsible for the allocation of 

these resources as they determine how 

healthcare is provided. Most of NHS 

England™s funding is provided to CCGs, 

who are responsible for planning and 

implementing healthcare services for 

their individual local areas.

Spending Review 2015
The NHS received increased funding 
to˜deliver its Five Year Forward View, 

but˜needs to˜deliver £22 billion of 
 
ef˚ciency savings to achieve its goals.
As in the 2010 and 2013 spending reviews, health 
spending has been protected compared with most other 

areas of government spending. The 
2015 Spending 

Review
 increased NHS funding (which makes up the 
vast majority of Department funding) by £19 billion from 

£101 billion in 2015-16 to £120bn by 2020-21 (see ˜gure). 

The increase is front-loaded, with proportionately more 
occurring at the start of the period. The government 

intends the Spending Review settlement to provide the 

basis for delivering the Five Year Forward View, including 

seven-day services, as well as other priorities such as 

new clinical strategies for cancer and mental health. 

The settlement assumes that NHS England will deliver 

£22˚billion of ef˜ciencies (see˚
Future˚challenges
 on 

page˚17 for more details). 
The provision of health and social care services is closely 
linked and the Spending Review sets out ambitions˚for 

integrating health and social care across the˚country 

by 2020. The 
Better Care Fund
, which provides funds 
for integrated services, will continue and, from 2017, 

includes speci˜c funding for local government, rising to 

£1.5 billion by 2019-20. Local authorities can now set an 

additional 2% precept on council tax bills to raise new 

funding for adult social care. Commentators,˚such as the 

Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, have 

raised concerns about whether this level of funding is 

suf˜cient to cover current commitments, given policies 

such as the introduction of the new National Living 

Wage,˚continuing˚reductions in˚central government 

support to local authorities and that˚some funding 

does˚not start until 2017.

In October 2014, the NHS published its 
Five Year 
Forward View
, which sets out a new direction for 
the service. Its˚three priorities are: an upgrade in 

prevention and public health; greater control for 

patients over their own care; and removing barriers 

in how health and social care is provided. The Five 

Year Forward View envisages a range of different care 

models, with local areas encouraged to choose from 

a small number of new˚approaches to providing care. 

These 
new models
 focus on integrating services and 
moving care out of hospital where appropriate.

The C&AG gave˜an unquali˚ed opinion on 
the accounts, but highlighted a number 

of˜issues for attention.
The C&AG certi˜ed the 
Department of Health™s 
Accounts
 on 12 July 2016, with an 
unquali˜ed
 opinion
 (that is, the ˜nancial statements give a true 
and fair view, in all material respects, in accordance 

with the identi˜ed ˜nancial reporting framework). 

The˚accounts cover the Department™s arm™s-

length˚bodies (including NHS England and its CCGs), 

NHS providers and other delivery partners and health 

bodies (see˚
Appendix One
).1Emphasis of matter
As in previous accounts, the C&AG wrote an Emphasis 

of Matter paragraph to highlight the uncertainties 

over the value of the liability recorded for the Clinical 

Negligence Scheme for Trusts, particularly for incidents 

incurred but not yet reported. He also drew attention 

to the fact that signi˜cant changes could occur to the 

value of this liability if assumptions about factors which 

affect the value of this liability Œ for example, the HM 

Treasury discount rate used in the valuation or the 

severity and frequency of legal claims Œ do not hold.
Report on accounts
2015-16 has been a challenging year ˜nancially for the 

Department, with a large number of trusts reporting a 

de˜cit. Given the scale of the ˜nancial and performance 

challenges facing the Department, the C&AG took the 

unusual step of producing a 
report on the accounts
. The report provides more details of the Department™s 

˜nancial situation, and the speci˜c steps it took to 

ensure it stayed within its voted budget. The˚following 

pages summarise the report.
The accounts highlighted a number of key governance issues:
Financial risk and 
sustainability
 Œ NHS providers 
continued to face significant 
financial 
challenges
 and the 
Department led a number of 

actions
 to tackle these Œ see 
links for more details.
Fraud
 Œ the Department is 
leading work to coordinate 

the development and delivery 

of anti-fraud work across 

the Health Group. It is still 

developing a sector-wide 

view on the level of fraud 

throughout the health system. 

The forthcoming 2016 to 

2020 Health Group Anti-Fraud 

Strategic Plan will determine 

the priorities for counter-fraud 

work from April 2016.
Data issues
 Œ There were two issues in 2015-16. First, NHS 
Shared Business Service, who provided primary care support 

services to NHS England in several areas, reported a large 

backlog of unprocessed correspondence relating to patients. 

A national incident team is managing the incident to ensure 

that all correspondence and patient-related issues are dealt 

with. NHS England will carry out an internal review.
Second, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory 
Agency coordinated an investigation into an error in an online 

tool used by GPs to assess the potential risk of cardiovascular 

disease in patients. The Department received clinical advice 

that indicated that the population-level risk to patients is small; 

it asked GPs to contact individual patients to determine if any 

further action is necessary.
Core performance standards
 Œ performance against all 

operational standards was 

challenging, with a number 

of targets missed Œ see more

Findings from our value-for-money work
 9 Departmental Overview: Department of Health | © National Audit Of˜ce 2016 
 | DP Ref: 11236-001Report on accounts
The Department and its partners are still 
some way from implementing a plan to put 

the NHS™s ˚nances on a sustainable footing.
In 2015-16 the Department exceeded its total budget 
by £207 million, but kept within the voted budgets 

set by Parliament for revenue (RDEL) and capital 

(CDEL) Œ see below for an explanation. For RDEL, 

the˚Department kept within its budget by £210 million, 

out of a total budget of £114.7 billion. For CDEL, the 

Department kept within budget by £58 million, out of 

a total budget of £3.6 billion. The margins by which 

the Department met its budgets were greater than last 

year when RDEL was achieved by some £1.2 million, 

but these margins nevertheless remain wafer-thin in 

the context of overall health spending in England. 
The Department received an extra £417 million of 
receipts from the National Insurance Fund, more than 

originally anticipated. The Department did not notify 

HM Treasury of these extra receipts that it received 

from HM Revenue & Customs. Therefore, neither 

HM Treasury nor Parliament had the opportunity to 

consider whether to reduce any voted funding for 

the Department by an equal and opposite amount. 

Without these extra receipts, the Department would 

have exceeded its voted RDEL.˚
The failure to follow well-established practice in 

relation to these National Insurance receipts has been 

ascribed by the Department to an administrative 

error. HM Treasury has chosen not to impose ˜nes 

on the Department due to this overspend against its 

budgetary controls.

The Departmental Expenditure Limit, or DEL, is the 
budget allocated to a department: spending that 

the government argues can be controlled rather 

than driven by demand (the latter is covered by 

Annually Managed Expenditure). DEL funding is 

made up of RDEL Œ resource spending on day-to-

day resources and administration costs, and CDEL 

Œ capital spending on investment. The Department™s 

RDEL budget comprises both voted and non-voted 

amounts: Parliament votes on around 80% of this. 

The non-voted remainder comprises income from the 

National Insurance fund. If˚the˚Department exceeds 

its voted amount, the C&AG must qualify his opinion 

on the accounts due to an ‚excess vote™. A breach of 

the non-voted amount does not result in a quali˜ed 

opinion Œ but does still have implications for how the 

Department is managing its budget.

The Department took a range of actions, 
including making non-recurring savings, to 

stay within budget
Ł The Department took a range of actions to 
manage its position in 2015-16 and address the 

growing de˜cit in NHS providers.˚While these 

are technically justi˜able, they would not be at 

the core of a credible˚plan to secure the ˜nancial 

sustainability of˚the NHS in England.˚Some of these 

measures could have long-term consequences. 

The˚switching of £950 million from capital to revenue 

budgets means that long-term investment plans 

have been set aside for the short-term goal of 

meeting˚day
-to
-day spending.
Ł Local NHS trusts ended the year with a combined 

de˜cit of £2.45 billion (NHS Foundation Trusts 

with £1.1 billion and NHS Trusts with £1.35 billion). 

All˚types of provider are experiencing growing 

demand coupled with rising costs.
Ł NHS England recorded an underspend of 

£599˚million, which contributed signi˜cantly to 

the Department™s overall position. However, the 

major factors in NHS England™s underspend were 

non
-recurrent. Opportunities for underspends 
in 2016-17 are further limited by NHS England 

having˚to maximise the funding available for 

front
-line˚services and primary care transformation 
in what is expected to be a year of exceptional 

challenge for the NHS.

Our audit of the Department™s 2015-16 Annual report and accounts
Report on accounts
Findings from our value-for-money work
We consider the main challenges for the 
Department and other health sector bodies 

to be about securing 
˜nancial and service 

sustainability
, and about how well the 
accountability and regulation mechanisms
 work in a complex, devolved system.
Many of our reports focus on ˚nancial 
and service sustainability, highlighting the 

challenges that central˜and local bodies 

have to meet.
Sustainability and ˜nancial performance of acute hospital 
trusts
 (December 2015) 
Acute trusts™ ˜nancial performance has deteriorated 

sharply and is forecast to worsen. These trends are 

not sustainable. Measures taken by the Department, 

NHS England, Monitor and the NHS Trust Development 

Authority to help improve ˜nancial performance have 

been undermined by a turbulent planning period. Effective 

oversight will become harder if the number of˚trusts in 

˜nancial distress rises further.
Running a de˜cit seems to be becoming normal 
practice for acute trusts with the risk that poor ˜nancial 

performance is not taken as seriously as poor healthcare 

provision. While increased funding for the NHS could 

help to achieve ˜nancial balance, there needs to be a 

more holistic, coordinated approach to tackling trusts™ 

persistent ˜nancial problems beyond quick ˜xes to cut

Findings from our value-for-money work
Many of our reports focus on ˚nancial 
and service sustainability, highlighting the 

challenges that central˜and local bodies 

have to meet.
The commissioning of specialised services in the NHS
 (April 2016)
Spending on specialised services is an ongoing risk 
to NHS ˜nancial stability. Since NHS England became 

responsible for commissioning specialised services, 

spending has increased faster than other parts of 

the NHS and has not remained within budget. NHS 

England˚still does not have consistent information from all 

providers, without which it cannot manage the ongoing 

pressure on its budget, make effective strategic decisions 

or gain assurance that its objectives for these services 

are being met.
Investigation into the Cancer Drugs Fund
 (September 2015)
In the two years to March 2015, the cost of the Fund 
increased by 138%. Although NHS England has taken 

action to control costs, the Fund is not sustainable in its 

current form. It was intended as a temporary measure until 

a new pricing system was put in place when the existing 

Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme expired in 2013. 
However, no new pricing mechanism has been introduced. 

In July 2015, NHS England proposed that the Fund should 

become a ‚managed access™ fund that would pay for 

promising new drugs for a set period before the National 

Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) decides 

whether the drugs should be recommended for routine 

commissioning. Data on patient outcomes to evaluate the 

impact of the Fund are not available.
Managing the supply of NHS clinical staff in England
 (February 2016)
Having the right numbers and types of clinical staff is 
crucial to the ef˜cient and effective operation of the NHS. 

However, NHS workforce planning is complex and is not 

an exact science. Health Education England is the ˜rst 

national body speci˜cally tasked with making strategic 

decisions about planning the future workforce. Providers 

remain responsible for ensuring they have enough clinical 

staff with the right skills. Across the health system as a 

whole, there are shortcomings in how the supply of clinical 

staff is managed, in terms of both planning the future 

workforce and meeting the current demand for staff.

Governance and accountability 
mechanisms must evolve to meet new 

developments in the health sector
Care Quality Commission (CQC) Œ Capacity and capability 
to regulate the quality and safety of health and adult social 

care
 (July 2015)
The CQC has made substantial progress to change its 

regulatory model. It is developing a more intelligence-driven 

approach to regulation and has designed a model that 

sets out in principle the connections between resources, 

activities, outputs and outcomes. It is better able to 

estimate how much inspections and other regulatory 

activities cost. However, it has much more limited 

information for assessing ef˜ciency or effectiveness, or 

measuring its overall impact on the quality of care.
The CQC has a substantial challenge to recruit and train 
all the staff it needs and to give them the con˜dence, as 

well as the skills, to apply the regulatory model. It also 

needs more complete data about regulated bodies, 

particularly in the adult social care sector, and better 

quanti˜ed indicators of its own performance. Managing 

public expectations about how far and fast it can achieve 

this, at the same time as it takes on new responsibilities, 

is a substantial demand.
but ultimately an unsuccessful venture, which failed for 

˜nancial reasons which could, and should, have been 

foreseen. It had the strong potential to join together all 

bodies in the local health economy and to deliver better 

patient care. However, limited oversight and a lack 

of commercial expertise led to problems that quickly 

became insurmountable.
Managing con˛icts of interest in NHS clinical 

commissioning groups
 (September 2015)
The Department recognised the potential for con˛icts of 

interest in the new system for NHS commissioning, and 

the need for public con˜dence that con˛icts are dealt 

with appropriately. It took a proportionate response to 

the high potential risk. Our limited evidence suggests 

that in 2014-15 CCGs generally had arrangements for 

managing con˛icts of interest. NHS England has so far, 

however, collected little data centrally on how effectively 

CCGs are managing con˛icts. It has relied instead on an 

exception
-based assurance process, and on Monitor as 
the system regulator. Developments in the health service, 

in particular new arrangements for co
-commissioning 
primary care services, are likely to signi˜cantly increase 

the number and scale of con˛icts of interest.
Investigation into the collapse of the UnitingCare 
Partnership contract
 (July˚2016)
In December 2015 a ˜ve-year contract, worth around 

£800˚million, between UnitingCare Partnership and 

Cambridgeshire and Peterborough CCG collapsed 

after only eight months because it ran into ˜nancial 

dif˜culties. The contract was innovative and ambitious

Services for people with neurological conditions: progress 
review
 (July 2015)
Overall, progress against the Committee™s six 

recommendations has been mixed. Considerable 

further work is therefore needed to implement the 

recommendations in full and achieve the better services 

and outcomes for people with neurological conditions. 

For example, recent survey evidence indicates that 

only a small proportion of people with a long-term 

neurological problem have a written care plan. In the GP 

patient survey published in January 2015, 65% of people 

with a neurological problem said they de˜nitely, or to 

some extent, had enough support from local services. 

This was˚less positive than for people with long-term 

conditions more broadly.
Discharging older patients from hospital
 (May 2016)
Making sure older patients stay in hospital no longer than 
necessary requires a coordinated response across health 

and social care organisations. Unnecessary stays in 

hospital result in worse health outcomes for patients and 

waste NHS hospital resources. The number of delayed 

transfers is increasing at an alarming rate but does not 
capture the full extent of older people who should not be 

in hospital. While there is a clear awareness of the need 

to discharge older people from hospital sooner, there are 

far too many older people in hospitals who do not need 

to be there, at an estimated cost to the NHS of around 

£820˚million. Without radical action to improve local practice 

and remove national barriers, this problem will˚get worse.
Personalised commissioning in adult social care
 (March˚2016)
Local authorities across England report a wide range 
in the proportion of users taking up personal budgets, 

including direct payments. Recent evidence suggests 
that personal budgets bene˜t most, but not all, users and 

that the way a personal budget is implemented is key to 

whether users bene˜t from it. Some local authorities are 

constrained in how, and the extent to which, they can 

personalise care by the need to reduce overall spending. 

It is not clear whether local authorities will achieve 

the spending reductions they have forecast without 

putting user outcomes at risk. Some local authorities 

are struggling to manage and support their local care 

markets as well as we would expect of a well
-functioning 
public service market. Authorities are taking different 

approaches to implementing personal budgets; some 

are˚struggling to ˜nd workable approaches.
Stocktake of access to general practice in England
 (November 2015)
While people™s experience of accessing general practice 
remains positive, patient satisfaction with access has 

declined gradually. There is considerable variation in 

patient experience. If patients cannot access general 

practice they are more likely to suffer poorer health 

outcomes, or to use other, more expensive, NHS 

services˚such as A&E departments. 
The Department and NHS England are working to improve 
access but do not fully understand the demand for 

services or the capacity of the current system and need 

better data to make well-informed decisions about how to 

use limited resources to best effect.

The management of adult diabetes services in the NHS: 
progress review
 (October 2015)
Data now available since our 2012 report on 

diabetes˚services show that the Department, its 

arm™s
-length bodies and the NHS have made progress 
in reducing the additional risk of death for people with 

diabetes. However, performance in delivering the nine 

care processes and achieving the three treatment 

standards, which help to minimise the risk of diabetes 

patients developing complications in the future, is no 

longer improving. Regional variations in delivering care 

processes, achieving treatment standards and improving 

patient outcomes suggest considerable scope to improve 

diabetes services and outcomes.
Mental health services: preparations for improving access
 
(April 2016)
Introducing access and waiting time standards is a ˜rst 
step towards the goal of achieving ‚parity of esteem™ 

between mental health and physical health, with both 

services valued equally in terms of, for example, access 

to care or allocation of resources. It˚should also help to 
improve services and outcomes for the large number 

of people who are affected by mental ill-health. The 

Department and NHS England, working with other 

bodies, are starting to make progress to put their 

aspirations into practice. Not everything was in place 

when the access and waiting time standards took effect 

from April 2016 with a number of challenges needing 

to be addressed. The Department and NHS England 

will need to work collaboratively and at pace with other 

arm™s-length bodies and local NHS organisations if the 

new˚standards are to be implemented successfully.
Care Act ˜rst-phase reforms
 (June 2015)
The Department has managed the introduction of Phase 1 
of the Care Act well. Consequently, 99% of local authorities 

were con˜dent that they would be able to carry out the 

Care Act reforms from April 2015. However, with the level 

of demand so uncertain, the Department™s cost estimates 

and chosen funding mechanisms put local˚authorities 

under increased ˜nancial risk. With pressures on all 

services, local authorities may not have˚suf˜cient resources 

to respond if demand exceeds expectation. In response, 

local authorities could delay or reduce services in the 

short term, risking legal challenge and potentially creating 

extra burden for individuals, their families and carers. 

Since the publication of this report, the government has 

announced delays to the implementation of Phase 2 of the 

Act, including deferring the introduction of a cap on care 

costs˚from 2016 to 2020.

remains extremely challenging, with ongoing 

pressures on maintaining service standards.

Sustainability and transformation plans (STPs)
Ł In December 2015, NHS England outlined 
a new approach
 to 
planning, in order to deliver the Five Year Forward View.
Ł Every health and care system in England must produce a 

five
-year˚STP, setting out how local services will develop and 
become sustainable.
Ł There are 44 STP ‚footprints™, representing groups of local 

authorities and healthcare providers, each of which will develop 

plans tailored according to local needs (see figure).
Ł The original deadline of 

June 2016 for submitting 

plans was delayed to 

October 2016.
Ł The planning round has 

altered to support the 

implementation of STPs. 

The 
2017Œ19 guidance
 covers a two-year period, 

rather than a one-year 

period. It reiterates the 

achievement of STP 

milestones as one of nine 

priority areas for providers.

Bridging the funding gap will be challenging
The NHS has set out that, alongside addressing demand 
and ef˜ciency savings, it would need additional funding 

to sustain services. It calculated that a combination 

of growing demand and ˛at real-terms funding would 

leave 
a funding gap of nearly £30 billion by 2020-21
 if 

no more ef˜ciencies were made. The 
2015 Spending 

Review
, which increased real-terms funding for the NHS, 
assumed it could achieve ef˜ciency savings of £22 billion 

between 2014-15 and 2020-21.
Of the £22 billion, the NHS expects 
£14.9 billion of 
savings to come from local providers
 (see ˜gure). 

This includes £8.6 billion of savings from productivity 

improvements, equating to a 2% improvement each year 

across hospitals, community health and mental health 

services. This will be challenging given that long-run gains 

are around 0.8% per year.
NHS England set out ˜ve tests it would use to assess the 
Spending Review settlement, in terms of implementing 

the Forward View. It 
concluded the settlement broadly 

met three of these
, including a front-loaded increase, 
but it did not fully meet its tests for an improvement in 

preventative health and increased funding for social care.
There is increasing central intervention 
to secure ˚nancial and operational 

performance 
In July 2016, NHS England and NHS Improvement 
published 
a joint plan to ‚reset™ the ˜nancial position 

of providers and commissioners
. This follows other 
interventions by these bodies, such as caps on agency 

spending. The plan extends many interventions to CCGs 

for the ˜rst time.
The plan includes 
additional funding of £1.8˚billion
 to˚trusts, with the aim that the overall ˜nancial

Future challenges
Increasing devolution will change 
accountability and funding structures 

across health and social care
Most NHS, public health and social care commissioning 
is already devolved to local organisations. Recent 

reforms˚have meant that NHS England, CCGs and local 

authorities are responsible for local budgets. 
Devolution of powers and funds from central government 
to local government has emerged as one of this 

government™s ˛agship policies. To date, 10 devolution 

deals have been secured in England. 
Greater Manchester
 is one example of devolution of health and social care.
The Cities and Local Government Devolution Act received 
Royal Assent in January 2016. It is a broad piece of 

enabling legislation designed to be applied across a wide 

range of public service functions.
Devolution could provide further opportunities to integrate 
services linking with initiatives including: the Better Care 

Fund; Integration Pioneers; Five Year Forward View New 

Models of Care / Vanguards; and co-commissioning of 

primary medical care.
Brexit may have implications for the health 
and social care sectors
There are a number of issues that the Department and 
NHS England may need to plan for as Brexit negotiations 

move forward. Three key areas are:
Staf˜ng:
 The NAO report on 
workforce planning
 (February˚2016) showed the signi˜cant shortfall in staff 
across the NHS, the largest (7.2%) in the nursing, midwifery 
and health visiting staff group. Recruitment from countries 

within the European Economic Area (EEA) has been an 

increasingly important source of clinical staff for the NHS. 

Estimates
 indicate that approximately 4% of NHS staff and 
6% of adult social care staff come from other EU countries.
Recovering the cost of NHS treatment for overseas 
visitors:
 Our report (October 2016) noted that the UK 
leaving the European Union (EU) will potentially have 

implications for the nature and scope of future charging 

arrangements, including any changes to legislation that 

has operated within an EU legal framework. At present, 

the UK™s membership of the EEA, by virtue of being part 

of the EU, means visitors from the EEA who are insured 

by their country of residence™s state healthcare system 

are not charged directly for treatment they receive in the 

UK, and vice versa. 
Regulations:
 A number of EU regulations have a 
signi˜cant impact on the NHS and social care sectors 
including: the working time directive; procurement 

and competition law; and regulation of medicines and 

medical˚devices.
Greater Manchester 
HM Treasury agreed a landmark deal in November 
2014 with Greater Manchester Combined Authority 

(GMCA) and Greater Manchester CCGs invited to 

develop a business plan for the integration of health 

and social care. In July 2015 the agreement was 

expanded with NHS England and Greater Manchester 

signing an agreement to bring together £6 billion of 

NHS and social care budgets to jointly plan these 

services. The deal covers 2.8 million residents and 

includes 12 CCGs. The region took formal control on 

1 April 2016.
