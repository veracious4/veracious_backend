     Septic shock    To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
 Septic shock is a serious condition that occurs when a bodywide infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure.Causes  Septic shock occurs most often in the very old and the very young.
 It may also occur in people with weakened immune systems.
 Any type of bacteria can cause septic shock.
 Fungi and (rarely) viruses may also cause the condition.
 Toxins released by the bacteria or fungi may cause tissue damage.
 This may lead to low blood pressure and poor organ function.
 Some researchers think that blood clots in small arteries cause the lack of blood flow and poor organ function.
 The body has a strong inflammatory response to the toxins that may contribute to organ damage.Risk factors for septic shock include:DiabetesDiseases of the genitourinary system, biliary system, or intestinal systemDiseases that weaken the immune system, such as AIDSIndwelling catheters (those that remain in place for extended periods, especially intravenous lines and urinary catheters, and plastic and metal stents used for drainage)LeukemiaLong-term use of antibioticsLymphomaRecent infectionRecent surgery or medical procedureRecent or current use of steroid medicinesSolid organ or bone marrow transplantationSymptoms  Septic shock can affect any part of the body, including the heart, brain, kidneys, liver, and intestines.
 Symptoms may include:Cool, pale arms and legsHigh or very low temperature, chillsLightheadednessLittle or no urineLow blood pressure, especially when standingPalpitationsRapid heart rateRestlessness, agitation, lethargy, or confusionShortness of breathSkin rash or discolorationDecreased mental statusExams and Tests  Blood tests may be done to check for:Infection around the bodyComplete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistryPresence of bacteria or other organismsLow blood oxygen levelDisturbances in the body's acid-base balancePoor organ function or organ failure Other tests may include:A chest x-ray to look for pneumonia or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema)A urine sample to look for infection Additional studies, such as blood cultures, may not become positive for several days after the blood has been taken, or for several days after the shock has developed.Treatment  Septic shock is a medical emergency.
 In most cases, people are admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital.Treatment may include:Breathing machine (mechanical ventilation)DialysisDrugs to treat low blood pressure, infection, or blood clottingHigh volume of fluids given directly into a vein (intravenously)OxygenSedativesSurgery to drain infected areas, if neededAntibioticsThe pressure in the heart and lungs may be checked.
 This is called hemodynamic monitoring.
 This can only be done with special equipment and intensive care nursing.Outlook (Prognosis)  Septic shock has a high death rate.
 The death rate depends on the person's age and overall health, the cause of the infection, how many organs have failed, and how quickly and aggressively medical therapy is started.Possible Complications  Respiratory failure, cardiac failure, or any other organ failure can occur.
 Gangrene may occur, possibly leading to amputation.When to Contact a Medical Professional  Go directly to an emergency department if you develop symptoms of septic shock.Prevention  Prompt treatment of bacterial infections is helpful.
 Vaccination could help prevent some infections.
 However, many cases of septic shock cannot be prevented.Alternative Names  Bacteremic shock; Endotoxic shock; Septicemic shock; Warm shockReferences  Russell JA.
