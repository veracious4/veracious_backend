In a period of nine months, a tiny Kentucky county 
of fewer than 12,000 people sees a 53-year-old 

mother, her 35-year-old son, and seven others die 

by overdosing on pain medications obtained from 

pain clinics in Florida.
1 In Utah, a 13-year-old fatally 
overdoses on oxycodone pills taken from a friend™s 

grandmother.
2 A 20-year-old Boston man dies from an 
overdose of methadone, only a year after his friend 

also died from a prescription drug overdose.
3 These are not isolated events. Drug overdose death 

rates in the United States have more than tripled since 

1990 and have never been higher. In 2008, more than 

36,000 people died from drug overdoses, and most of 

these deaths were caused by prescription drugs.

          Commonly Abused Medications 
Opioids Derived from the opium poppy (or synthetic 

versions of it) and used for pain relief. 

Examples include hydrocodone (Vicodin
®), oxycodone (OxyContin
®, Percocet
®), fentanyl (Duragesic
®, Fentora
®), methadone, 
and codeine. 
Benzodiazepines Central nervous system depressants used as 

sedatives, to induce sleep, prevent seizures, 

and relieve anxiety. Examples include 

alprazolam (Xanax
®), diazepam (Valium
®), and lorazepam (Ativan
®). Amphetamine-like drugs 

Central nervous system stimulants used 

to treat attention de˜cit hyperactivity 

disorder (ADHD). Examples include 

dextroamphetamine/amphetamine 

(Adderall
®, Adderall XR
®), and 
methylphenidate (Ritalin
®, Concerta
®).        
       
       
  
       
   WHAT DO WE KNOW? 
The role of prescription painkillers 
Although many types of prescription drugs are 
abused, there is currently a growing, deadly epidemic 

of prescription painkiller abuse. Nearly three out 

of four prescription drug overdoses are caused by 

prescription painkillersŠalso called opioid pain 

relievers. The unprecedented rise in overdose deaths 

in the US parallels a 300% increase since 1999 in the 

sale of these strong painkillers.
4 These drugs were 
involved in 14,800 overdose deaths in 2008, more than 

cocaine and heroin combined.
4 The misuse and abuse of prescription painkillers 

was responsible for more than 475,000 emergency 

department visits in 2009, a number that nearly 

doubled in just ˜ve years.
6 More than 12 million people reported using prescription 

painkillers nonmedically in 2010, that is, using them 

without a prescription or for the feeling they cause.
7 The role of alcohol and other drugs 
About one-half of prescription painkiller deaths involve 

at least one other drug, including benzodiazepines, 

cocaine, and heroin. Alcohol is also involved in many 

overdose deaths.
8      In 2008, there were 
14,800 prescription painkiller deaths.

7 825 nonmedical users7       How prescription painkiller deaths occur 
Prescription painkillers work by binding to receptors in 
the brain to decrease the perception of pain. These 

powerful drugs can create a feeling of euphoria, 

cause physical dependence, and, in some people, 

lead to addiction. Prescription painkillers also cause 

sedation and slow down a person™s breathing. 
A person who is abusing prescription painkillers might 
take larger doses to achieve a euphoric effect and 

reduce withdrawal symptoms. These larger doses 

can cause breathing to slow down so much that 

breathing stops, resulting in a fatal overdose.

In 2010, 2 million people 
reported using

e the drugs come from 
Almost all prescription drugs involved in overdoses 
come from prescriptions originally; very few come 

from pharmacy theft. However, once they are 

prescribed and dispensed, prescription drugs are 

frequently diverted to people using them without 

prescriptions. More than three out of four people who 

misuse prescription painkillers use drugs prescribed to 

someone else.
7 Most prescription painkillers are prescribed by primary 

care and internal medicine doctors and dentists, not 

specialists.
10 Roughly 20% of prescribers prescribe 80% 
of all prescription 
painkillers.

   Who is most at risk 
Understanding the groups at highest risk for overdose 
can help states target interventions. Research shows 

that some groups are particularly vulnerable to 

prescription painkiller overdose: 
  People who obtain multiple controlled substance 

prescriptions from multiple providersŠa practice 

known as ﬁdoctor shopping.ﬂ
14,15   People who take high daily dosages of 

prescription painkillers and those who misuse 

multiple abuse-prone prescription drugs.
15,16,17,18,19     
 Low-income people and those living in rural areas. 
  
-˛   People on Medicaid are prescribed 
painkillers at twice the rate of non-Medicaid 

patients and are at six times the risk of 

prescription painkillers overdose.
20,21 One Washington State study found that 45% of 

people who died from prescription painkiller 

overdoses were Medicaid enrollees.
20   People with mental illness and those with a history 

of substance abuse.
19 Where overdose deaths are the highest 
The drug overdose epidemic is most severe in the 

Southwest and Appalachian region, and rates 

vary substantially between states. The highest drug 

overdose death rates in 2008 were found in New 

Mexico and West Virginia, which had rates nearly ˜ve 

times that of the state with the lowest rate, Nebraska.

    WHAT CAN WE DO? There are many different points of intervention to 
prevent prescription drug overdoses. States play 

a central role in protecting the public health and 

regulating health care and the practice of the health 

professions. As such, states are especially critical to 

reversing the prescription drug overdose epidemic. 
The following state policies show promise in reducing 
prescription drug abuse while ensuring patients have 

access to safe, effective pain treatment.

Thirty-six states have 
}operational 
PDMPs.22 CDC RECOMMENDATIONSPrescription Drug Monitoring Programs 
Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) are 
state-run electronic databases used to track the 

prescribing and dispensing of controlled prescription 

drugs to patients. They are designed to monitor this 

information for suspected abuse or diversionŠthat is, 

the channeling of the drug into an illegal useŠand 

can give a prescriber or pharmacist critical 

information regarding a patient™s controlled 

substance prescription history. This information can 

help prescribers and pharmacists identify high-risk 

patients who would bene˜t from early interventions. 
CDC recommends that PDMPs focus their resources on 
 patients at highest risk in terms of prescription 

painkiller dosage, numbers of controlled substance 

prescriptions, and numbers of prescribers; and 
 prescribers
 who clearly deviate from accepted 

medical practice in terms of prescription painkiller 

dosage, numbers of prescriptions for controlled 

substances, and proportion of doctor shoppers 

among their patients. 
CDC also recommends that PDMPs link to electronic 

health records systems so that PDMP information is 

better integrated into health care providers™ day-t

day practices. 
               Patient review and restriction programs 
State bene˜ts programs (like Medicaid) and workers™ 
compensation programs should consider monitoring 

prescription claims information and PDMP data 

(where applicable) for signs of inappropriate use of 

controlled prescription drugs. For patients whose use 

of multiple providers cannot be justi˜ed on medical 

grounds, such programs should consider reimbursing 

claims for controlled prescription drugs from a single 

designated physician and a single designated 

pharmacy. This can improve the coordination of 

care and use of medical services, as well as ensure 

appropriate access, for patients who are at high risk 

for overdose. 
Health care provider accountability 
States should ensure that providers follow evidence-

based guidelines for the safe and effective use of 

prescription painkillers. Swift regulatory action taken 

against health care providers acting outside the limits 

of accepted medical practice can decrease provider 

behaviors that contribute to prescription painkiller 

abuse, diversion, and overdose. 
Laws to prevent prescription drug 
abuse and diversion 
States can enact and enforce laws to prevent doctor 
shopping, the operation of rogue pain clinics or ﬁpill 

mills,ﬂ and other laws to reduce prescription painkiller 

diversion and abuse while safeguarding legitimate 

access to pain management services. These 

laws should also be rigorously evaluated for their 

effectiveness. 
Better access to substance abuse treatment 
Effective, accessible substance abuse treatment 

programs could reduce overdose among people 

struggling with dependence and addiction. States 

should increase access to these important programs. 
These recommendations are based on promising interventions and expert opinion. Additional research is 
needed to understand the impact of these interventions 
on reducing prescription drug overdose deaths.
