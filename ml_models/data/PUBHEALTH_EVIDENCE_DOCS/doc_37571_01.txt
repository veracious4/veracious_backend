 This is a rule that should be revisited."
 (Stays and bill passes)Is it a medical thing or a melanin thing?

 They don’t want to see a black persons speak the truth but they can’t not find a bill to line the pockets of lobbyists.Honestly i had no idea Rep Rush did that and respect the HELL out of it.
 I love to wear hoodies and as a white guy after Trayvon I was mad as fuck that I can get away with it but others can’t because they’re darker than me.

 Let’s be honest y’all.
 A black man in a hoodie is considered more threatening to general folk than a white man in a hoodie.

 My dad is white and I've tried telling him about some of the things I deal with everyday or have to be prepared for, and some of the blatant racism I've experienced in my life and he just shrugs and says "I don't know", as if he doesn't understand we're talking about things that have literally happened to me, not could happen.

 What a terrible act he committed.
 Old fucks and their stuffy rules.
 Why didn't they remove him?
 Wasn't the acting Speaker a Democrat?

 Have happened.
 This is the price I have to pay to be black and have the freedom to wear a hoodie.
 I try to be more aware of my privilege and how other people have to navigate the world differently than I do.
 Its crazy what you see once you open your eyes.
 I'm Asian so I can only imagine how shit it would be if you couldn't even have your hood up when it's cold as fuck outside.
 What exactly is he protesting?
 The only logical explanation is that he has a half a bottle of Tito’s in those cylinders.
 It's not a fucking poisonous gas you human frat paddle.
 Fuckin dumbass hat rule... that mother fucker started banging that gavel the second he put that hood up.
 There's no way he had that rule sitting in front of him- he just didn't like that the guy looked \"hood\".
 Fuck you, Mr. Bitch ass speaker.
 Hearing that verdict brought me to tears.
 How exactly would you be \"protecting\" yourself if you don't even wear it correctly?
 They may have to do a double take but you'll go on about your day without incident.
 Why is that not a thing?
 We’re talking debate or throwing hands?
 If it’s anything like celebrity death match I’d pay to watch it.
 Recently, law enforcement from Midlothian went over to Robbins for a call at a bar fight with reports of guns in the scene.
 Before he got there, the security guard had everything under control.
 This poor black security guard was studying to become a police officer.
 As soon as the Midlothian cop walks in he sees a black man with a gun and shoots.
 Ends up shooting the security guard that worked at the bar.
 It was hard to watch the family of the deceased security guard speak during the press coverage.
 Lets dispel with this notion he doesn't know what he's doing.
 He knows exactly what he's doing.
 It’s ridiculous that a person of color, black or brown, will get stopped and fucked with for doing absolutely nothing wrong.
 And a person of non-color will not be bothered a vast majority of the time.
 He was trying to make a valid point and proved his point when he got removed.
 I got harassed by police a lot by the way I dressed and looked as a teenager, it was humiliating and frustrating.
 That's a place to do the work of the people, get noticed with passing legislation not shocking people.
 It's hard to take \"to make light of an epidemic\" at face value.
 What does that even mean?
 Backpacks also put me on edge.
 On the bright side, this just further illustrates his point.
 of course the black guy trying to bring awareness to inherent racism within America was silenced.
 He is McConnell level shitty.
 Naw Welcome to the shit show!
