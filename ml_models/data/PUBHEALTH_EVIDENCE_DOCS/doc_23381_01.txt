Table 5 summarizes job information.
 Table 6 reprints the state level information from the latest Council of Economic Advisers report.
 While the “full-time equivalents” reports do not specifically differentiate public sector or private sector jobs, you can get a good idea by looking at the more detailed breakdowns on Table 2 (state agencies) or Table 3 (federal agencies).
 For example on Table 3, the FTEs listed under USDOT would largely be private sector highway construction jobs.
 Similarly, the jobs listed under Defense on the contracting row would be primarily private sector defense contractors.
 The large number of jobs listed under Education would largely be teachers or other instructional personnel.
