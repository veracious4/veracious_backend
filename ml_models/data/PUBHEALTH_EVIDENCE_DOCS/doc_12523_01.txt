 v  Executive Summary 
 Community health centers
 (CHCs)
 provided primary
 health care to over 
20 million 
patients in 2011
, 60% of whom are women and 25% of whom are women of childbearing age.  
Health centers
 play 
a central role in women™s health, 
because of their mission to furnish a full 
range of 
primary and preventive care services
, including 
family planning and birth control
 for 
women of reproductive age
.  As a result of the Affordable Care Act, which provid
e for historic 
insurance expansions, broad first
-dollar coverage of family planning services, and direct 
investment in CHCs, it is projected that health center capacity will virtually double by 2019, and 

accordingly, the role of health centers in the provi
sion of women™s health care services can be 
expected to grow significantly. 
This study examines how health centers fulfill their family 

planning 
mission.  
 Study Methodology
 Nationwide survey. 
Following a meeting of experts, the project team developed and 
pre
-tested an e
-mail survey instrument, which was fielded to federal health center grantees in 
operation during 2011.  The purpose of the survey was to gather detailed information regarding 

the family planning and reproductive health services offered by he
alth centers as well as service 
organization and delivery. Survey questions focused on respondents™ overall approach to family 

planning across all sites, as well as the services found at the responding grantee™s largest medical 

site, selected as an indicat
ion of the widest range of services offered to patients. 
The survey was 
sent to the medical directors and chief executive officers of 959 federal health cente
r grantees 

and w
e received responses from 423 grantees, for a 44% response rate.   
 Case studies. 
In addition to the nationwide survey, the research team conducted in
-depth 
case studies to probe more deeply into how health centers provide family planning and 

reproductive health care, as well as the barriers to care. The case studies were designed to 

provide a clearer understanding 
of the
 issues health centers face in furnishing preventive and 
family planning services, and to identify internal and external factors that act as either barriers to 

or facilitators of care, gaps in care, and successful strate
gies, care models,  and best practices.  

Six health centers were recruited for full in
-depth case studies, while an additional three health 
center sites were selected for targeted review. 
 Key Findings
 Scope of 
on-site
 care. 
Virtually all 
community 
health 
centers provi
de family planning
 services, 
and 87% of all service sites deliver what can be characterized as a ﬁtypicalﬂ package of 
care
, defined as 
testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (
STI
) , prescription 
and/or delivery of oral contr
aceptives plus one additional contraceptive method (e.g. injectables, 
IUDs, emergency contraception pills, condoms or hormonal implants). At the same time, 
the
ir scope
 of care and approach to service delivery varies widely
; 19% of 
survey respondents 
report
ed that
 their largest sites both prescribe and dispense all forms of contraception 
on-site
. Injectable and barrier method contraceptives represent t
he 
methods 
most commonly available 
on-site
. Some of the most common types of contraceptive services, such as
 birth control pills, 
frequently are unavailable for 
on-site
 dispensing, despite their low cost and the importance of 
immediate availability in promoting access to care.
  Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 vi  Referrals for care
. Virtually all health centers 
maintain 
 referral arrangements for 
services they do not offer 
on-site 
such as vasectomies, female sterilization, follow
-up specialized 
care, follow
-up for irregular findings from cervical cancer screenings, and infertility treatment. 
The formality of referral arrangements var
ies across cente
rs and by type of service.
    Key factors associated with comprehensive
 health center
 services
. More comprehensive 
family planning services, including a broader range of 
contraceptive methods
, are associated 
with certain characteristics: size; a Western or
 urban/suburban location; the presence of 
obstetrical and 
gynecological clinical staff and dedicat
ed family planning counselors; 
and 
a policy environment that promotes access to care, including more generous Medicaid adult 
eligibility standards.
 Health cen
ters that participate in Title X. 
Twenty
-six 
percent
 of respondents report 
participating in the Title X family planning program.  Title X participation was the 
single 

strongest 
predict
or 
of on-site
, comprehensive family planning services 
(outreach, counsel
ing, and 
a broad range of methods) at the largest service site for each reporting health center. 
Respondents 

that participate in Title X tend to have larger staff and to be located in
 urban
/suburban settings, 
and in t
he Northeast or West
.  They tend to hav
e higher proportions of patients who are 
uninsured, Medicaid eligible, adolescents
, and women of childbearing age and a 
lower 
proportion of non
-Hispanic white patients, 
suggesting that their services are of particular 
importance 
to 
minority women.  Title X
 provides additional resources to develop more robust 
programs
, including counseling,
 while establishing extensive and specific performance 
guidelines.
   The policy climate
. The overall policy climate in which health centers operate, including 
both Medicai
d eligibility levels for adults as well as other state policies such
 as laws that 
specifically 
enable 
greater 
access to family planning services, 
is 
associated with more 
comprehensive health center family planning services. 
 Challenges to the provision of 
family planning services. 
Health centers 
struggle to 
maintain the scope 
and 
quality of family planning services
. Major drivers of this challenge 
include: 
the cost of care coupled with the financial 
realities 
 associated with serving low
-income 
populations
; difficulties 
attracting and retaining  specialized clinical and counseling staff
; the 
unique 
considerations 
 associated with 
serving adolescents
; and 
issues 
 associated with how 
best 
to communicate 
the value and importance of family plann
ing services
 to p
atients and
 communities. 
  Recommendations 
 Adapting family 
planning 
guidelines to health center practice.
 Clear guidance 
on family 
planning in health center settings 
is lacking.  The
 Health Resources and Services Administration
 (HRSA)
, which oversees the 
health centers program, 
could 
consider
 adapt
ing 
 to health center 
practice 
settings 
the 
comprehensive family planning guidelines expected to be issued 
by HHS 
in 
2013.  For these updated practice guidelines to be effective within the complex realities of 
health 
center practice, an 
additional trans
lational step becomes essential
. HRSA 
might, for example, 
establish 
a working group
 to review the HHS guidelines and use them as the basis to 
delineate 
minimum expectations for health center practice arrangements
 with respect to
 on-site
 services, 
referral arrang
ements, outreach and counseling
. Such g
uidance also could set 
performance 
measurement standards 
for services and
 staff training and development.  
  Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 vii
   Family 
planning 
practice re
-design and quality improvement. 
Second,
 we recommend 
a family planning practice re
-design and quality improvement effort
 paralleling previous health 
center quality improvement initiatives. Such an initiative 
could bring together persons 
knowledgeable in clinical 
and 
administrative health 
center practice
 in order to 
tackle the practical 
and structural issues that arise in achieving excellence in family planning, including such issues 

as how to manage special population outreach, best practices in counseling and securing 
on-site
 services, ho
w to develop referral arrangements, and 
how to address 
issues of patient privacy and 
confidentiality.  
 Results could be 
disseminated through 
in-person meetings of 
clinician 
and 
management networks
 as well as
 via effective, broad based and low
-cost 
web
-bas
ed training.  
  
 Bringing value
-based purchasing and health home techniques to family planning
. The 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is now pursuing value
-based purchasing 
initiatives that develop payment models to incentivize improvements 
in quality performance.  

We recommend that HRSA and CMS consider establishing such an initiative for payment of 

family planning services, in collaboration with state Medicaid directors, managed care 

organizations, and experts in the provision of health ser
vices to medi
cally underserved 
populations. 
The goal would be
 the development of 
payment 
model
s that incentivize 
the 
provision of 
comprehensive family planning services in health centers as well as in other 

settings, s
uch as Title X
-financed clinics, in or
der to foster the creation of family planning health 
homes. 
 An ideal payment model would emphasize comprehensive 
on-site
 care, access to a fuller 
range of contraceptive services, the development of well
-structured referral arrangements that 
address 
more c
omplex procedures, and strong outreach and counseling programs.  
These v
alue
-based purchasing
 models could be disseminated to Medicaid programs, Medicaid managed care 
organizations and entities offering alternative benefit plans to newly eligible populatio
ns, 
qualified health plans (QHPs) sold in health insurance Marketplaces, and health plans that 

participate in 
the 
Basic Health Programs
 established under the ACA
.   
 Fostering h
ealth center/Title X collaborations.  
In many communities
, health centers 
parti
cipate in Title X, but in many more, these two essential safet
y-net
 providers offer services 
independently of one another. This variation reflects patient and community preferences; some 

patients prefer to receive all necessary primary health care under on
e roof, while many others 
desire separate systems of health care for primary care and family planning needs.  Because both 

models are important, we 
recommend investment 
-- by HRSA and the Office of Population 
Affairs 
Œ or by other entities 
Œ in 
Title X/hea
lth center collaboration models that strengthen the 
collaboration options
 and provide 
detailed best
-practice 
support assistance. 
  
 Finally, we note the 
importance of additional research
 into 
patient care
-seeking patterns
 and preferences
, community and pat
ient engagement, and most importantly, perhaps, a 
more in
-depth examination of current Medicaid payment practices related to family planning services
. Repeatedly we were told that despite the special FQHC payment method that emphasizes 

comprehensive, bundl
ed services, as well as broad state flexibility to incentivize certain types of 
Medicaid practices, state family planning payment methods do not favor investment in key staff, 

the 
on-site 
provision of contraceptive methods, or comprehensive outreach and co
unseling.  
Learning more about current state family planning payment approaches is of enormous 

importance to any value
-based purchasing initiative and would greatly aid efforts to upgrade the 
quality and comprehensiveness of care.

 1  Introduction 
 Community 
health centers represent the nation™s single largest prim
ary health care 
system
 serving medically underserved populations
.  In 2011, 1128 federal health center grantees 
opera
ting in some 8
,500 delivery sites furnished care to more than 2
0 million patients;
 total 
patient visits exceeded 
80 million that year.
1Health centers™ role in prim
ary health care has grown steadily over the past two decades 
and is expected to grow further
 as a
 result of the Affordable Care Act™s health insurance 
expansions coupled with its $9.5 billion Health Center Growth Fund.
 An additional 100 ﬁlook
-alikeﬂ health centers that 
meet all requirements of the federal program but that do not receive federal grants 
provided care
 to 1 million patients.  
 2 Together these two 
elements of the A
CA are expected virtually to double health center capacity by 2019. 
3One of the most important services furnished by all he
alth centers is reproductive care for 
women of childbearing age
. Understanding health center performance in the area of preventive 
services related to reproductive health, and family planning services in particular, becomes 
especially important.  No prior 
study ever has comprehensively examined health centers™ role in 

family planning.  For this reason, the 
Geiger Gibson
/RCHN Community Health Foundation 

Research Collaborative and the 
Jacobs Institute of Women™s Health 
undertook this special 

analysis, 
whose p
urpose is to 
examine 
the role of 
health center
s in 
family planning
.   Further 
strengthening the quality and accessibility of care at health centers thus emerges as a national 

health policy priority.
    For purposes of this study, the term ﬁf
amily planning
ﬂ encompasses 
several distinct 
components of care: outreach to at
-risk populations; education and counseling;
 screening, 
testing
, and 
treatment for conditions that can
 affect 
reproductive and overall health;
 and access to 
a range of primary bir
th control methods.  This study explores
 health center performance in 
connection with the overall patient popula
tion of reproductive age, but it
 focus
es especially on 
services for women, because of the 
ACA™s emphasis on 
preventive benefits for 
women™s health
.4The report 
begins 
with a background 
and overview that describes
 health centers
, critical 
issues related to the importance of family planning
 services and care
-seek
ing behavior, and the 
financial, social, political and cultural factors that might be expected to 
influence 
health center 
performance. 
 We then p
resent the pri
ncipal findings from a
 study 
carried out over the 2011
-2012 time period, w
hich examined 
family planning services at 
health centers
. The evidence 
presented in
 this 
report 
comes from two sources: a nationwide survey of all federally funded

 centers™ experiences in the provision of preventive health care for women of childbearing age.  

We conclude with discussion of implications of our findings for health center practice and 

policy. 
  Background 
 Health Center 
Patients, Services and Funding
 From their earliest days as small demonstration 
projects 
launched 
in 1965 
by the Office 
of Economic Opportunity, health centers have grown into the single largest source of primary 

health care 
for
 medically underserved communities
 and populations
.  Codified
 at Section 330 of 
the Public Health Service Act and overseen by the Health Services and Resources 

Administration (HRSA)
, health centers operate in accordance with 
five
 basic 
requirements: 
(a) 
location in or service to a community or population designated 
as medically underserved; (b) 
governance by a community board, the majority of whom are patients of the health center; (c) 
a duty to furnish care to the entire community regardless of age, health status, income, or other 
factors unrelated to the need for c
are; (d) 
financial assistance 
through 
prospective adjustment of 
charges in r
elation to family income; and (e
) provision of a comprehensive range of primary 
health care services
.  Family planning has been a core requirement of all health centers since the 
program was first established as part of the 
Public Health Se
rvice Act in 1974
.    Virtually all health center patients are 
low
-income
.  In 2011
, over
 92% had family 
incomes below twice the federal poverty level, and more than 70
% had below
-poverty income.
5 Compared to the general population, health center patients are nearly five times more likely to 

have below
-poverty income (72
% of h
ealth center patients versus 15
% of the total U.S. 
population)
,6 nearly two
-and
-a-half times more likely to be uninsured (3
6% versus 16
%), and 
nearly two
-and
-a-half times more likely to 
receive 
Medicaid (39
% compared to 16
%).7Health center patients are disproportionately members of racial and ethnic minority 
groups; L
atino
s and African Americans represent nearly half the
 patie
nt population.  
Children
 under 18
 comprise 
32% of health center patients
 (females age 15
-18 are also included in the 
count of all
 women of childbearing age); although
 elderly 
patients 
represent only 7
% of 
the 
patient population
 overall
, their numbers have 
grown 
far more rapidly than 
either the 
growth of 
the elderly population or the expansion of health centers would account for.
 8Their poverty and residence in medically underserved communities mean that health 
center patients
 experience
 elevated 
health ri
sks
. Visits to health centers are significantly more 
likely tha
n  visits 
to private physicians to 
involve treatment for one or more ser
ious and chronic 
                                                     5 Rosenbaum S, Shin P, & Paradise

10
Women™s reliance on health centers is striking. 
 Females comprise 
59% of all people 
served by health centers, and
 wom
en of childbearing age alone represent
 28% of the health 
center patient population
. 11
  In 2011, health centers served an estimated 
24% of all 
low
-income
 women of childbearing age in the U.S
.,12
 while t
he 
number of 
female 
patients who 
are women of 
childbearing age has 
doubled over the past decade
, from 
2.8 million to 
5.6 million.
13
Health c
enters have a long
-standing history as key providers of school
-based health care 
for adolescents. In 2004
, the latest year for which comprehensive data are available, 
over 500 
school
-based health centers were operated by or in partnership with federal heal
th center 
grantees.
  14
Like all health care providers, community health centers
 operate in accordance with both 
state and federal laws related to the regulation of health professions and health care entities, 
regulation of business operations, provider payme
nt, the 
provider
-patient relationship
 (including 
the confidentiality of health information)
, and
 health information privacy
. 15
 Health centers that 
also receive funding under Title X of the Public Health Service Act
, the federal family planning 
program, are 
covered by that 
law™s special
 federal protections related to the confidentiality of 
care for both adults and minors, which preempts more restrictive state laws.
16
Federally funded h
ealth centers automatically 
qualify for certification as 
ﬁfederal
ly 
qualified h
ealth centers (FQHCs)ﬂ
 under
 Medicare and Medicaid
, for purposes of both
 coverage 
and payment
.  The Medicaid FQHC benefit encompasses physician services, the services of 
nurse practitioners and physician assistant services, and ancillary costs related to p
rofessional 
services.  The 
Medicaid 
FQHC payment system 
(which also applies to the Children™s Health 
Insurance Program (CHIP) as well as to payments by Qualified Health Plans sold in Health 

Insurance Marketplaces) 
is a prospective
 negotiated 
encounter
-base
d rate 
paid on a bundled 
basis. The FQHC payment system 
reflects the cost of furnishing both FQHC services as well as 

ﬁother ambulatoryﬂ services
 covered by Medicaid and 
furnished 
to Medicaid
 patients
. Examples 
of ﬁother ambulatoryﬂ services are 
prescribed
 drugs and devices, preventive services covered 
  Health centers 
that do not participate in Title X do not have this special protected status, 
since Section 330 

contains no similar 
federally preemptive
 confidentiality 
provision 
and has never been interpreted 
by HRSA as establishing such a standard.

. Health centers therefore rely on other 
public and private 
grant
s and contracts in 
addition to their Section 330 funding, including awards under programs such as Title X
, in order 
to help defray their costs. 
 Indeed, 
state and local grants and private contracts 
 amount to 1
4% of 
health center financing.
  (Figure

  Studies of ﬁhigh shareﬂ Medicaid practices suggest that health 
centers comprise approximately 18
% of such practices, which tend to be dominated 
by health 
care safety net providers such as health centers, public hospitals, and children™s hospitals.

                                                  17 The ACA mandates coverage of preventive women™s health services under all health plans sold in the individual and group 
health markets.  The ACA also classifies preventive services as an ﬁessential health ben
efitﬂ for purposes of coverage through 
state health insurance Exchanges and Medicaid ﬁbenchmarkﬂ coverage for newly eligible persons.  PPACA §§1302 and 2201.  
However, the ACA does not guarantee coverage of preventive health benefits for currently eligible
 beneficiaries other than 
beneficiaries who are under age 21 and entitled to coverage for early and periodic screening diagnosis and treatment (EPSDT) 
benefits.   Thus, very poor adult women currently eligible for Medicaid as parents or persons with disabi
lities or on the basis of 
pregnancy in the case of women may not be entitled to a well
-woman exam except to the extent that such an exam is recognized 
by the state as part of a family planning visit. 
   Health centers frequently are the principal source of primary care in Medicaid managed care 
networks, and they are expected to play a significant role
 in networks developed for Medicaid 
expansion enrollees as well as residents of medically underserved communities who gain health 

insurance coverage through subsidized enrollment in qualified health plans offered through state 

Exchanges.

At the same time, health centers face major challenges
. The first is the realities of 
attempting to furnish care to large numbers of uninsured and underinsured patients. A second 

involves the challenges associated with the recruitment and retention of clinic
al and

whose referral arrangements must be open to insured and uninsured patients alike.  
An additional 

important challenge, arising from health centers™ uni

involves balancing
 human and financial resources against an ever
-growing need for affordable 
and accessible health care across the entire 
lifespan of their 
patient population
s. The pressure on 
health centers to
 grow to meet need has intensified in recent years as other safety net providers 
have lost fundi

 35  For example, an assessment of the impact of Texas™ decision to defund
 dozens of clinics participating in its state
-funded 
family planning program has reported on the impact of this decision on health centers, which have struggled to respond to the
   Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 8  health centers 
are faced with the prospect of having to balance depth of care for any particular 
health need against their ability to respond to the full range of patients who seek their care. 
   In extreme cases, this tradeoff 
between
 access
 and financing
 may 
require eliminating 
under
-financed 
services 
(for example
, having to end restorative dental care for adults entirely 
when a state Medicaid program eliminates 
coverage of 
adult dental care
).36
In balancing the pressures that bear on their practices, health centers may opt for a level 
of health care that while clinically appropriate, does not necessarily represent the 
most de
sirable 
and appropriate
 range of 
care 
 options available to patients. This would be particularly true in the 
case of newer treatments and procedures whose cost is high and which may require additional in
-service training or procedure certification for clin
ical staff, or which may have additional 

equipment requirements or high stocking costs. In addition, some newer treatments or procedures 

may be in less demand or may be less 
well financed
 through public and private health insurance. 
These procedures may be
 unaffordable to 
those 
patients in need of care who are not in a position 
to pay for a particular treatment.
     More often, 
however, health centers™ tradeoffs 
may be
 less dramatic
; rather than eliminating
 any one service 
entirely, health centers may 
search for 
the 
least costly,
 yet 
reasonably 
effective
, approach to 
treatment. This may mean 
offering
 a clinically appropriate but smaller range of treatment options 
(e.g., fewer pharmaceutical options, not 
stocking 
the latest 
or costliest 
drugs and devices
, particularly in states with more limited Medicaid 
eligibility levels or more stringent 
coverage 

limits, or not offering procedures that require staff with specializ
ed and more advanced training
). The need to 
aggressively
 manage cost
s also
 may mean instituting somewhat longer waiting times 
for appointments while still trying to handle same
-day and walk
-in appointments; managing with 
less staffing depth; maintaining fe
wer locations and shorter hours; or undertaking less patient 
outreach. 
 Of course, health centers are not alone in having to balance the affordability of care 
against the 
availability of the 
newest
 technologies and in
novations.  
But the average patient 
income level at health centers
, coupled with
 the 
sheer size of their uninsured patient population
s, place health centers in a
n especially
 challenging
 position
, because they must 
balance 
the scope 
and depth of any set of 
patient
-specific treatment options
 against a minimally reasonable level of 
care across the full age spectrum
..  This need to balance scope and depth against more basic 
access has grown
, not only in the face of the economic downturn but also as a
 result of 
legislation enacted in 2011 that reduced health center 
grant funding by $600 million. This 
reduction 
led
, in turn,
 to the diversion of an equal amount of funding from the Affordable Care 
Act™s Health Center Growth Fund.

Family Planning 
as Part of Preventive
 Reproductive Hea
lth
 Care
   Because family planning is a required 
health center
 service, it is important to place family 
planning within a broader context of preventive health care for women of reproductive age. 
 One 
element of this broader range of services is sometimes termed ﬁpre
-conceptionﬂ care, which 
includes services that 
iden
tify and modify biomedical, behavioral, and social risks to a woman's 
health or pregnancy outcome through prevention
, as well as treatment and management in 
order 
to address health problems that must
 be 
 acted on before conception 
(or early in
) pregnancy
.39
  A second element is sometimes referred to as inter
-conception care and consists of comprehensive
 care between pregnancies to maintain health
 and reduce reproductive health risks
 during 
childbearing years
.  A third element consists of 
screening and treatm
ent of sexua
lly transmitted 
infections (STI
). A final and fourth element of preventive care is 
education and counseling ab
out 
health and sexual activity along with 
effective birth control services through a range of 

contraceptive 
methods
 in the case of wom
en who are sexually active.
40
This multi
-faceted concept of preventive health care for women
 includes
 well
-woman 
visits, 
family planning counseling
 and FDA approved contraceptive methods
, and screening and 
treat
ment of STIs. These are
 reflected in 
preventi
ve 
benefit guidelines 
issued by HRSA in 
2011,  41
 and 
based on a
 comprehensive scientific analysis conducted by the Institute of 
Medicine.
42
 When the ACA is fully
 implemented in 2014 virtually all insured women of childbearing 
age will be entitled to these b
enefits
, either through Medicaid or through enrollment in Qualified 
Health Plans or non
-grandfathered employer
-sponsored or individual coverage.  In the case of 
health center patients, Medicaid of course emerges as the most important source of coverage. 

Female health center patients of childbearing age, if insured, will be covered for these services 
either through the traditional Medicaid program (which already covers these benefits) or through 

Alternative Benefit Plans, in the case of newly eligible women.
  Many of these preventive 
services also fall 
under
 the definition of family planning services and supplies, a required 
Medicaid benefit for all  beneficiaries.  
   Contraception, a central e
lement of family planning
, has been recognized as one of the 
great 
public health achievements of the 20th century.  Access to birth control is essential for all 
                                                  38 Natio

 10  sexually active individuals, and it is especially so for women. On average, women seek to 
prevent pregnancy over a 30
-year time period; by contrast, women activel
y seek to become 
pregnant or experience pregnancy for a five
-year period.  One study has estimated that of more 
than 66 million women of childbearing age in 2008, 36 million needed contraceptive care, while 

nearly half of this group 
-- more than 17.4 milli
on women 
-- needed publicly funded 
contraceptive services as a result of low
-income, age (under 20 years), or both.
43
Because 
preventive care related to 
reproductive health spans both services specific to 
reproduction as well as primary health care design
ed to keep all people healthy, women of all 
incomes 
may 
seek reproductive health care from multiple health care providers. Over half of all 
women who 
report having a regular source of health care report receiving 
care from two or more 

providers.
   44
 Typically
 care may be split between 
general primary care providers and 
providers 
specializing in obstetrics and gynecology.
45
Health Center Practice 
in a Family Planning Context
  There is no
 clearly preferred source or approach
 to 
women™s health care
.  Women™s tendency to use 
multiple sources of treatment for their on
going 
reproductive health care needs 
presumably 
holds true for women who receive care at 
community 
heal
th centers, although the fact that health center patients reside in medically underserved 
communities can 
be expected to limit their options. 
 Because of
 the potential ri
sk for medical 
underservice, health centers™
 ability to 
furnish both primary care and the full range of family 
planning services 
assumes special importance.
 As with all forms of health ca
re, health center practice is shaped by
 a myriad of 
factors 
related to 
economic, 
legal, 
policy, 
political, practical, clinical
, social and cultural
 considerations
.  Federal grant condition
s  One major consideration is
 the conditions of practice placed on h
ealth centers as 
recipients of federal grants.  The Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC), the division within 
the 

Health Resources and Services Administration (
HRSA
) that oversees the health center program, 
has elected not to 
promulgate extensive treatment
 guidelines for 
any aspect of 
health center 
practice, including 
family planning
. Instead, BPHC expects that 
across all conditions and the age 
spectrum, health center 
clinic
ians w
ill adhere to evidence
-based practice standards drawn from 
the 
range of 
primar
y care 
and related 
specialty fields, such as guidelines established by 
the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, gerontologic
al societies, or, in the case of reproductive health, 
the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology

 11  The Bureau™s approach enables health centers to adjust their
 standards to local practical 
and economic conditions
. At the same time, 
however, the absence of clear clinical practice 
expectations may mean that health 
centers lack the comprehensive
 guidance that increasingly is a 
hallmark of evidence
-based practice.
47
 The absence of comprehensive federal clinical 
practice 
guidelines might result in greater
 varia
tion
 in how health centers approach any particular clinical 
service
 generally
, and family planning in particular
.  By contrast, 
health centers that participate 
in Title X 
might be expected to offer more robust programs given the availability of targeted 
funding and heightened performance expectations. 
The relationship between Title X funding and 
stronger family planning performance has been documented by at least 
one study that examined 
the impact of Title X on clinical performance in the area of family planning.
48
Financial and community perception considerations
    Beyond formal agency expectations, the health services research literature  underscores 
the fact 
that
 multiple financial, 
legal, 
social, cultural, community
-based, and political factors 
can 
influence the design and operation of health care organizations.
49
,50
,51
,52
These types of f
inancial
 considerations 
can be expected to have practice
-wide 
implications for health centers.  
Health centers cannot discriminate among patients based on their 

insurance status, meaning that the s
ame range of services 
must be 
available to 
both insured and 
 State laws governing 
the 
practice of health care and the relationship between health profession
als and patients may be of 
importance.
 Health insurance coverage and payment policies also matter, particularly in the case 
of providers such as health centers that serve high numbers of 
low
-income
, uninsured patients.  
In a family planning 
context,
 the ab
sence of binding federal expectations on the scope of state 
family planning coverage means that states may 
exclude 
or limit coverage of 
certain types of 
procedures 
from coverage as a family planning service. 
 For example, given Medicaid™s 
dominance as a pa
yer of health center services, the absence of coverage for certain birth control 
drugs or devices could be expected to 
significantly affect health centers™ ability to stock certain
 drug
s or device
s or invest in 
the specialized training that use of more tec
hnologically advanced 
procedures might require. 
Furthermore, 
as noted previously, 
despite the 
bundled nature of 
the 
FQHC payment 
mechanism, many 
Medicaid agencies may exclude drugs and devices from the 

FQHC payment rate and may instead pay for these servic
es separately

 12  uninsured patients
. While uninsured patients could be charged an 
inco
me-adjusted fee
, the 
financial situation of uninsured health center patients is such that as a practical matter, health 
centers
 would lack the revenues needed to stock and make available costly newer technology for 
patients other than those who are insured.  As a result, for those 
drugs and devices that are more 

costly
, health centers may lack the financial means to make the servi
ce readily available.  
 The 
cost problem associated with stocking and maintaining more costly types of birth control 
has 

been noted in other studies, including studies of 
Title X
-funded
 clinics.
53
Finally, worthy of note and yet difficult to document
, are
 practice choices flowing from 
health 
centers™ perceptions regarding 
community attitudes and beliefs
.  Health centers are 
governed by community boards
, which may or may not support comprehensive family planning 
programs. 
Equally likely, however, 
is that 
health center staff may draw certain assumptions 
about the extent to which their boards and communities want their clinics to emphasize certain 

services.  
Whether health centers™ decision to emphasize or de
-emphasize certain services within 
their pract
ices i
s the result of consultation
 with board members or patients or 
instead, an 
assumption about how such a focus would be perceived in their communities
, is a question that 
lies beyond the scope of this study and one that may merit further exploration. But
 other research 
suggests 
that provider beliefs, preferences and cultural attitudes shape practice, particularly in the 

case of reproductive health.
   54

Federal and state Medicaid policy. 
  There is no reason to assume otherwise in the case of health 
centers, particularly given the absence of 
stron
g agency expectations and 
the 
complex 
circumstances under which health centers practice
.    It is difficult
 to overstate the importance of Medicaid eligibility standards and program 
expectations. 
Under federal Medicaid l
aw, family planning services and supplies are required 
services for all 
ﬁcategorically needyﬂ 
beneficiaries
. Medicaid maintains generous eligibility 
standards for pregnancy and postpartum coverage, and 
beginning in 2014, all 
adolescents 
under 
18 with famil
y inc
omes up to 138
% of the federal poverty level
 will be 
entitled to coverage.  
However, Medicaid eligibility level
s for non
-pregnant parents and caretakers can be 
exceptionally low, and in most states, individuals of childbearing age who are neither preg
nant, 
nor parents or caretakers of minor dependent children, nor disabled would 
not 
be entitled to 
coverage at any income level. 
However, Medicaid eligibility levels for non

-related services 
to some or all

-income
 men and women, although only
 seven states offer 
expanded 
eligibility
 to persons under

  Research suggests that 
as a general matter, 
more generous 
Medicaid 
eligibility standards 
for adults 
are associated with more comprehensive and accessible health 
center services
 because of Medicaid™s prominent role in health center fina
ncing.
59
Federal family planning guidelines afford state Me
dicaid agencies 
considerable latitude 
in defining the scope of their family planning coverage.  
States have latitude in determining the 
precise range of procedures that will be recognized as a family planning service.  Although 

federal law allows states to
 claim enhanced 
federal Medicaid 
funding 
(at a 90% contribution 
rate) 
for all FDA
-approved over
-the
-counter and prescribed drugs and devices,
 As a result, 
health center
s located in states with more generous adult
 coverage 
(either generally or for family 
planning services) 
might be expected to offer 
more robust family planning programs.  
 60
Similarly, CMS 
gives considerable coverage latitude to states that offer ex
panded 
Medicaid eligibility for family planning.  States using this eligibility option also can elect to 

cover both family planning and family planning 
ﬁrelatedﬂ service
s; coverage of related services 
qualifies for federal contributions at a state™s normal
, non-enhanced federal payment rate.  
Among the related services states may cover are
: STI treatment and follow
-up care
 including re
-screenings
; annual visits for men
; drugs to treat lower genital tract and genital skin infections
; and 
other medical, diagn
ostic, and treatment services 
customarily 
furnished in a family plannin
g sett
ing
, such as human papilloma virus (
HPV
) immunization
s and treatments for 
certain major 
complications
 of family planning
 (e.g., 
 perforated uterus resulting from an intrauterine d
evice 
insertion
 or complications from
 sterilization
). expansive 
coverage is not mandatory.

The absence of robust clinical standards more generally. 
   Health centers are expected to identify 
relevant 
professional standards of clinical practice 
and to apply those standards to their own perfo
rmance. But
 where family planning is concerned, 
clinical practice standards are 
limited.

Health center clinicians 
may be involved in one or more active 
health center clinician 
networks
. Through general collaboration
, coupled with 
specific 
efforts to design and carry out 
multi
-site 
quality improvement 
initiatives
, these networks ef
fectively act
 as a health center
-specific professional society, developing and disseminating clinical practice standards across 

multiple health centers. To the extent that such networks focus on women™s preventive health
 and family planning practice, their
 recommendations might be expected to carry significant 
weight across all health centers.  
To date,
 however, 
preventive services for 
women
, including 
family planning, have 
not 
received clinician network focus. 
    Another source of guidance regarding 
comprehe
nsive preventive care for women might 
be 
the evidence
-based measures used to examine c
linical quality performance. But these 
measures offer only relatively limited performance benchmarks for women™s preventive care.

 measure of population health.
 Furthermo
re,
 Medicaid quality performance measurement standards commonly lack a family 
planning or birth control component.
 As Figure 1 illustrate
s, health center funding is derived from multiple sources, one of 
which may be 
Title X
. Unlike 
the health centers program, Title X operates under 
 extensive 
and 
specific 
federal 
performance 
guidelines
, owing to the fact that the 
Title X 
statute is far more 
specific on the nature of the service to be offered, a not surprising fact given 
the singular 
purpose 

of Title X. 
 For example, unlike §330, 
Title X 
specifies provision of a 
broad range of acceptable 
and effective family
 planning methods and services 
including natural family planning methods,

 The presence of other community resources to care for underserved and uninsured populations. 
  Because of th

s they face in marshaling limited resources to meet broad

adjust their services to take into account 

other sources of care for 
medically 
underserved populations.  Thus, health centers operating
 in 
the same community as clinics 
that specialize
 in family planning services might offer basic 
family planning 
services at their sites
, with referral arrangements to specialized providers for 
patients who seek additional types of care. 
 Study 
Design 
 The 
purpose of this study was to systematically examine the design, organization, and 
operation of women™s family planning
 and reproductive health
 services
 at health centers.  
This 
study defines
 ﬁfamily planningﬂ in accordance with
 the general structure of Tit
le X, standards 
developed by the CDC, and a framework used 
by the Guttmacher Institute
. Our definition
 encompass
es four
 major groups of services: (1) 
counseling an
d education; (2) contraceptive 
drugs and devices; (3) related diagnostic tests (e.g., for pre
gnancy, STI, and HIV); and (4) 
treatment after
 diagnosis.  This
 definition does not mean that 
providers offer 
all procedures 
falling within any specific service 
class, but it does establish certain
 broad 
service 
parameters
.  For example, a 
health center 
might offer only certain forms of contraceptive methods but still 

would be considered as offering this class of services.  
 In 
designing this study, the 
research team 
was 
guided by 
expert advisors
 drawn from the 
worlds of health center practice and family pl
anning and reproductive health. The study 
consisted of 
an electronic survey of health centers, 
and
 a field study of selected health centers
 carried out through both 
on-site
 and telephone 
interviews
 designed to elicit deeper responses.

 Following a meeting of experts, the project team 
developed 
and pre
-tested 
an e-mail
 survey instrument, 
which was 
fielded to
 federal

 in operation during 2011.  
The purpose of the survey was to gather detailed information regarding the

organization and 
delivery
. Survey q

 17  Specific questions were included regarding 
numerous matters: 
the range of contraceptive 
services offered; 
on-site
 availability of presc
rip
tion drugs and devices; 
approaches to special 
populations such as adolescents
; school
-based education and care; staffing arrangements; 
screening, testing, and treatment practices; and collaborations with other community provi
ders
.  The survey also inqui
red about
 health center practices in areas such as patient confidentiality, 
with a focus on confidentiality m
easures involving adolescents. 
Questions related to practice 
approaches, such as open
-access scheduling for women™s health care also were included
.  In 
addition, the survey asked questions 
regarding 
the presence of other resources
 within health 
centers™ catchment areas
, such as
 Title X clinics, 
and 
whether 
respondents received 
Title X 
family planning funding.  Finally, the survey asked questions rega
rding the types of barriers 
encountered in furnishing preventive
 women™s health and family planning services.  
 The survey was sent to 
the medical directors and chief 
executive
 officers 
of 959 federal 
health center grantees for whom we had 
current 
contact 
information 
out of
 a universe of 
Section 
330 grantees
 of approximately 1,130
. We received responses from 4
23 grantees, for a 44
% response rate.   
 A comparative analysis of the survey data showed that respondents were similar to non
-respondents on most cha
racteristics, while differing in certain key areas.  Respondent grantees 
tended to be larger than non
-respondents grantees, averaging more than 20,000 unique patients 
and 10.3 full
-time-equivalent (FTE) physicians on staff, compared to averages of 14,000 p
atients 
and 6.7 FTE physicians on staff for non
-respondents.  Respondent and non
-respondent grantees 
showed similar patient mixes (e.g., approximately 40% uninsured and 31
-34% covered by 
Medicaid). Respondents and non
-respondents showed similar percentages
 of women of 
childbearing age (28%
-29%), the primary population targeted for family planning services. The 
geographic distribution of the respondents generally was comparable to non
-respondents across 
the 10 federal health center regions delineated by HRSA
.  However, over
-representation exists 
with respect to HRSA Region 1 (CT, MA, ME, NH and VT), while significant under
-representation exists with respect to HRSA Region 3 (DC, DE, MD, PA, VA and WV).  
 Because the survey population is not large enough to cr
eate reasonable weights across the 
10 HRSA regions, estimates have been adjusted 
based 
on the distribution of health centers by the 
U.S. Census Bureau Regions (West, Midwest, South, and Northeast).  Through weighting 
adjustments, we have been able to impro
ve the representativeness of the responses in relation to 

the size and regional distribution of the community health center. However, the weights do not 

fully correct for over
-representation of HRSA Region 1.   Since health centers in the Northeast 
tend to
 offer more comprehensive care, findings related to comprehensiveness may therefore be 
slightly over
-stated.
  ﬁTypicalﬂ 
family planning
 service measure.  
 For that portion of our survey that focused 
on grantee
-level information, we sought to determine what
 health centers might ﬁtypicallyﬂ (or 
usually) provide at their various service sites.  For this aspect of the study we used the survey 

data to determine the most commonly prescribed methods in order to create a definition of 

ﬁtypical.ﬂ A ﬁtypicalﬂ package
 was defined to include STI testing and treatment, prescription 
and/or delivery of oral contraceptives plus one additional contraceptive method (e.g. injectables, 

IUDs, emergency contraception pills, condoms or hormonal implants.

the

 Availability of each selected method was given a single point value; methods were 
weighted an additional point value, ranging from 
0.5 to 1

 possible was 12.5
. Next,
 multivariate regression modeling
 was conducted
 to explore key factors associated with

  We employed this large

 the degree of

because within any hea

; indeed, 
health center

 Thus, in 
order to bring greater 
comparability to our analysis, we asked health centers to report on the comprehensiveness of 

care within their largest service sites.

  Case studies. 
 In addition to the nationwide survey, the research team conducted in
-depth case studies to 
probe more deeply int
o how health centers provide family planning and reproductive health care, 
as well as the barriers to care. The case studies were designed to provide a clearer understanding 
of the issues health centers face in furnishing preventive and family planning ser
vices, and to 
identify internal and external factors that act as either barriers to or facilitators of care, gaps in 

care, and successful strategies, care models,  and best practices.  
 Case study sites were selected using a maximum variation sampling appr
oach that 
included a variety of health center grantees in terms of size, scope of practice, staffing and 

patient mix, and geographic location. The sampling methodology also took into account 
variations in state Medicaid policies, ranging from extensive inv
olvement through family 
 Health Centers and Family Plan

planning services. Six health centers were recruited for full in
-depth case studies, while an 
additional three health center sites were se
lected for targeted review. Staff interviewed a range of 

clinical and administrative staff, and the interviews resulted in detailed information regarding 

health centers™ approach to family planning and primary reproductive health care. In particular, 

the i
nterviews yielded important information related to the provision of preventive care and 
family planning, including on
-site care  and contraceptive dispensing, off

care
-seeking patterns, payment arrangements, staffing issues, informa
tion sharing capabilities 
with off

Through case studies, the research staff gained a better understanding of the factors that support

 Policy environment. 
 To account for
 factors that influence health care
 practice
 and the availability of family 
planning services, particularly in the case of
 adolescents, 
the research team
 categorized 
 relevant 
state public policy.  We divi
ded state policies
 into two distinct categories
: those affecting access 
to care more generally 
(such as Medicaid eligibility income levels
); and those that affect 
family 
planning a
vailability specifically, such as 
confidentiality 
and privacy laws. The bodi
es of law 
used 
reflect policies identified by the National Institute for Reproductive Health as heightening 
or reducing barriers t
o contraceptive services. The 
research 
team used the most current
ly 
available
 policy 
data and 
information. Policies were assig
ned weights and values for scoring
, and 
states were scored and then 
categorized b
y total score ranging across
 degree
s of restrictiveness
 (non-restrictive, somewhat non
-restrictive, neutral/mixed, somewhat restrictive, restrictive).
 In 
assigning values to p
olicies, researchers gave greater value to policies that experts tend to 
associate with a higher level of access to birth control services by both minors and adults: laws 

that enable choice by minors and remove consent
-based barriers to access; sex educati
on laws; 
laws that enable one or more classes of health care providers to refuse to prescribe or dispense 

birth control drugs or devices, and laws that make birth control services more accessible to 
low
-income
 populations. 
This overall categorization was u
sed to determine whether a state™s policy 
environment had a significant impact on the availability of comprehensive family planning 

services at health center
s™ largest sites through multivariate regression modeling.
 We used 
similar methods to conduct anoth
er sub
-analysis which looked at the role of other policies such 
as minors™ access to contraceptives, school
-based sex education programs, and state family 
planning funding restrictions (exclusive of Medicaid coverage) in independently predicting 

comprehens
iveness of family planning services.
 We also conducted
 two sub
-analyses of different policy and financing factors 
in order 
to 
determine if they independently predicted comprehensiveness scores. The first analysis 

categorized states by their level of Medica
id coverage
, using a similar scoring and categorization 
methodology as described above. States were then coded as having broad, 
mid-range
, or narrow 
Medicaid coverage
 based on
 income eligibility
.  The criteria used to categorize 
Medicaid 
coverage include
d the following:  
1) 
state extension of coverage either via the ACA 
family 
planning waiver 
option or as a state plan amendment to all categories of 
low
-income
 adults AND 
that cover all 
low
-income
 adults (including parents/caretakers) at or above 100
% of FPL;
  2) 
states that both extend coverage for 
low
-income
 adults via the ACA option 
to implement 
coverage of 
low
-income
 adults ahead of the 2014 expansion date 
or as a Section 1115 
demonstration group AND set the income level for adults at leas
t at 75
% of the F
PL;  
3) 
states 
 Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 20  that have raised income eligibi

4) 
states that have not

 given higher scores
 for 
broader 
Medicaid 
expansions 
and were not given 
point
s if they have not yet expanded coverage in one of the ways described above. 
States could 
receive a maximum score of four points and a minimum score of negative one point.

Screening and Treatment
 Routine c

ydia screening of all sexually active young women age 25 and under is 
considered extremely important in finding and treating this most common form of 
STI. 
 Routine 
screening is especially important, since up to 70
% of all infections are asymptomatic, and 
because infection is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, 
and perinatal infections.
77
   Fifty percent of respondents reported that their largest sites routinely 
screen the target population for chlamydia.  More than 25%
 reported routine screening barriers 
such as cost, time pressure, staff awareness, and 
discomfort discussing the topic

ondents 
reported that staff at their largest site receive training in the family planning needs of

 26    Relationships Between Largest Sites and Independent Family Planning Clinics 
 Seventy
-five percent r
eport the presence of an independent family planning clinic in the 
community served by their largest site.  Among those reporting an independent family planning 
clinic in their largest site™s community, 62% reported receiving referrals and 69% reported 

mak
ing referrals for family planning services. As Figure 8 indicates, health centers both make 
and receive referrals, although receipt of referrals is slightly lower, raising the question as to why 

independent family planning clinics do not make more referral
s given the limited scope of their 
care.  
 Several factors might account for these referral patterns.  One might be the fact that 
health centers do not always know that patients who seek care have been referred; they might 

simply appear 
for care.  Another 
factor might be that family planning programs might maintain 

relationships with other health care providers in their service area, such as public hospitals or 

physician practices who make their services accessible to patients referred by a family planning 

provider. Managed care and formal provider network arrangements 
that limit the range of 

referral options 
might operate as a third factor
, since the Medicaid freedom
-of-choice guarantee 
for family planning services in the case of managed care enrollees exte
nds only to family 

planning procedures.
78
   Health centers would be the referral source in situations in which they 
serve as the designated primary care provider, but potentially not otherwise.

.  Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 27  The first factor 
Œ simply not knowing that patients have
 been referred from family 
planning programs 
Œ may be of particular importance. At the same time, the absence of a clear 
understanding of 
how patients are referred to or select the center 
may suggest that not all health 
centers maintain express agreements 
with family planning providers
, as would be necessary 
to 
ensure a 
full 
and seamless flow of patients between the two types of providers
, along with the 
exchange of information related to treatment.

Comprehensive Range of Methods
 at Health Centers™ Lar
gest Sites
  While all health centers reported that they make some family planning services available, 
the range of 
contraceptive methods
 varied, even at health centers™ largest sites.  To better 
understand the predictors of comprehensiveness of 
methods 
at h
ealth centers™ largest sites, we 
used the comprehensiveness index described in the methods section to measure availability of 

these services at the largest center site. 
The index scores for respondent health centers 
were
 widely distributed
, with values ran
ging from 0.5 to the maximum score of 12.5. The 
mean 
comprehensiveness score for respondents was 9.24,
 with a median of 
10.0 indicating that many 
health centers are able to make several contraceptive methods available either 
on-site
 or by 
prescription
, but not necessarily all methods
. Consistent with earlier findings, approximately 
19% of responding health centers reported making all methods available on
-site, corresponding 
to the maximum score of 12.5 on the index scale. 
At the same time, 
the 
distribution 
of the 
comprehensive score n exhibited a leftward skew
, indicating that 
a considerable proportion 
of 
largest sites
 offered less than the fullest level of comprehensive services
.   Two separate OLS regression models 
were run 
to determine the most salient fa
ctors 
contributing to comprehensiveness scores
. The
 multivariate regression modeling determined that 
several key factors were predictive of 
more comprehensive services, 
including
 being a large or 
medium sized health center
 (compared to small size)
, locatio
n in the West
ern
 region
 of the 
country
, location in a suburban setting 
(compared to urban or rural)
, the presence of OB/GYNs 
on staff, and the presence of dedicated family planning counselors, although 
having a family 

planning counselor on staff was
 only m
arginally statistically signific
ant in both models
 (See 
Table 3)
.  Receipt of Title X funding
 was a strong predictor of comprehensiveness scores in both 
models, as was the overall local policy and financing climate within which health centers 

operate. 
                                                    79 This type of exchange of electronic health information, if done so in a secure fashion, would be permissible without specific
 informed consent under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, because it
 is related to patient treatment.  45 C.F.R. §164.502(a)(1)(ii).  In the 
case of information related to substance use disorders, federal standards would require a specific informed consent.  Dependi
ng 
on states law, informed consent would be required for c
ertain conditions such as mental illness or HIV status.  Since patients 
must consent to treatment generally, one would presume that consent to data exchange on relevant matters could be secured as 
part of the treatment consent process.   In this regard, of
 course, the health center™s ability to assure the confidentiality of patient 
information related to family planning services through information segregation procedures would be a key element of an 
agreement between a health center and a Title X program, i
n light of the special confidentiality standards that apply to all Title X 
programs.

analysis was
 undertaken to better understand this 
relationship. 
Twenty
-six
 percent of all grantee respondents reported receipt of Title X funding at
 their largest site
.   First
, Title X provides additional family planning resources
.  As the
 Guttmacher Institute 
has pointed out, the availability of additional grant resources plays a key role in helping safety 
net providers such as health centers develop the staffing and supply capabilities to offer more 

robust services that, in turn, can be s
ustained primarily through Medicaid 
funding. 
82
Characteristics of T
itle X Funded Health Centers
   Second
, unlike Section 330, Title X 
establishes extensive and detailed expectations regarding both the 
scope of services and emphasis on certain high
-risk populations such as adolescents.
 Health centers that participate in Title X are more likely to be in a self

suburban location (
84%). They are also 
more likely to be locat
ed in the Northeast or West (63%

although the South

 This finding does not mean, of 
course, that Title X leads to these re
sults or influence the types of
 health centers that seek Title X 
funding. Nor is there reason to think that Title X grant
-making practices differ significantly in 
the Northeast 
or West or that health centers with larger white
, Non
-Hispanic
 populations are less 
likely to seek Title X participation. But if one considers Title X 
participation 
as a proxy for a 
dedicated program to improve access to comprehensive family planning servi
ces, our findings 
suggest that certain types of health centers
  those in the Northeast or West, those 
with a
 higher 
proportion of 
minority 
patients
, and those with more adolescents and higher Medicaid coverage 
  are more likely to seek to develop such programs.

  Figure 
12 shows 
the differences
 in contraceptive practice based on whether the health 
center™s largest site participates in Title X.  Small differences can 
be seen in the availability of 
oral contraceptives,
 of both
 the 
daily and extended
 types
, as well as in the use of injectable 
contraceptives and the patch and ring.   Relatively small
, but statistically significant
 differences 
also can be seen in the avail
ability of other forms of contraceptives, such as diaphragms, 
sponges, male condoms, female condoms and spermicides.  Larger 
significant 
differences 
are 
reported in
 the availability of emergency contraception, IUDs and implants.  Most 
striking, 
perhaps, is
 the fact that 
52% of large
st sites that participate in Title X 
offer all forms
 of 
contraception, 
compared to
 only 2
7% of 
non-participating sites

ning 
 33    Title X participation makes a large difference in the 
on-site
 availability of various forms 
of contracept
ion. Among the largest sites at non

53% provide oral contraceptives 
on-site
 and 
44% offer prescription only.  By contrast, 
85% of 
the 
largest sites 
at Title X

on-site
 availability of 
oral 
contraceptives, 
and 
14% reporting pr
escribing 
only. Similar patterns can
 be seen with 
injectables, IUDs, and implants.  In each case, Title X participation is associated with 
considerable
 differences in 
on-site
 availability, particularly in the case o
f IUDs and implants, 
both of which would require not simply the availability of counselors
, but also the presence of 
specially trained clinical professionals capable of 
administering the contraception 
on-site
. Health centers that do not receive Title X fun
ding more commonly indicated that oral 
contraceptives are prescribed but prescriptions are filled elsewhere and that patients are referred 

for IUD and implant insertion. These respondents reported using patient assistance 

pharmaceutical programs as well as
 referral providers offering discounted procedures in order to 
manage costs to patients.  
 On-site Testing and Treatment Services
 Although minor differences exist between Title X and non
-Title X recipients with respect 
to on
-site testing and treatment at t
heir largest sites, the differences are minor although some are 
statistically significant.  Title X does not appear to play a major distinguishing role where these 
services are concerned.

 Receipt of Title X appears to p

 report that routine c
hlamydia 
screening
 is always provided for sexually

health 
centers without Title X funding

 Nonetheless, both Title X and non

recommendations. Both Title X

kely

% and 28

 However, the two types of respondents
 reported 
different barriers

 Largest site practices associated with health centers receiving Title X funding were 
significantly more likely to maintain separate contact information for communications with 
adolescents regarding
 family planning services. However, a high proportion of health centers, 
both with and without Title X funding, reported that they take specific action to protect the 

privacy of medical records for adolescents (92% and 86%, respectively). Open
-ended respon
ses 
as part of the survey suggested that the most common forms of accommodation are provision of 

separate doors, hours, facilities, clinics, and practitioners.  The use of separate billing and claims 

procedures also were reported, but not consistently.

 36    The Relationship of
 State Policy Climate to Health Centers™ Family Planning 
Service Delivery
 Using the policy climate measures described in the methodology, we sought to 
model
 how the policy climate is associated with health center family planning servic
es. 
In models 
incorporating both Medicaid eligibility levels and other family planning state policies, w
e found 
that the presence of a Medicaid family planning expansion initiative alone is not a good predictor 
of the comprehensiveness of health center fam
ily planning services.  At the same time, we also 
found that 
the overall
 supportive climate for family planning specifically as reflected in state 
laws governing access to care, coupled with broader Medicaid eligibility more generally
, was 
jointly associat
ed with more
 comprehensive 
family planning care
.  Our 
findings indicate that 
state 
financing and coverage 
policies may not 
necessarily 
be independently related to the 
availability of comprehensive family planning services. 
 Overall, however, the state poli
cy environment in which health centers operate 
is an important factor that is associated with
 their ability to prescribe and deliver the full range of 
contraceptive and family planning services in their communities. 
 While this finding reflects 
point
-in-time conditions,
 it does 
suggest that more generous Medicaid eligibility standards
, coupled with more generous funding levels and a climate more supportive of family planning 

programs
, combine to create the conditions under which health centers can 
develop 
 more robust 
programs and 
provide 
a more comprehensive  range of family planning services.

 37   Qualitative Results
: Exploring Health Center
s™ Ability to Provide 
Comprehensive Family Planning Services
 Barriers Reported by Survey Respondents
 Approximately 250 r
espondents answered the open
-ended portion of the survey,
 which 
permitted them to describe barriers to their ability to offer more comprehensive services. 
 Some 
57% of respondents (w
ith no differences in the percentage of respondents based on the receipt 
of Title X), 
indica
ted that they encounter barriers to the provision of family planning services.  
Barriers identified 
spanned 
funding issues, 
restraints on 
access to services, staffing challenges, 
reaching adolescents, political and cultural hurdles to pro
viding care, outreach activities, 
confidentiality concerns, and providing care to specific population groups. 
 Financial challenges 
were 
the most frequently reported barrier health centers face in 
meeting the family planning and reproductive health needs o
f patients. The second most 

frequently reported barrier was access to specific family planning se
rvices. Access issues include 

a respondent™s
 inability to provide 
a requested contraceptive method 
or specific services because 
of the cost of offering the ser
vice or the lack of a community referral site.  Staffing emerged as 
the third 
most frequently reported barrier
.  The types of staffing problems reported included the 
absence of staff, staff 
who 
were not sufficiently trained in 
culturally appropriate care, 
staff 
turnover and recruitment difficulties, and the lack 
of staff
 with expertise in 
family planning and 
reproductive health care.
 Many health centers reported barriers 
specific to adolescent care, including an 
inability to 
provide specific services in sch
ool-based health centers, access difficulties because of the 
location of care, 
strict parental consent laws
, school systems opposed to allowing sex education, 
and 
difficulties in 
maintaining 
the 
confidentiality of services.
 Many health centers also reporte
d barriers to providing family 
planning care as a result of 
community
 political environment
. Political factors included 
provider refusal to provide service
s or fill prescriptions,
 conservative social values and
 religious 
objection to family planning and
 abortion, 
opposition toward Title X funding, protestors and violence outside of abortion clinics, 
and state laws or regulations. 
 Health centers also reported other barriers including 
lack of 
patient transportation
, low 
patient literacy and compliance, fundi
ng requirements, a low level of
 community kno
wledge 
regarding
 available services, 
challenges coordinating
 with other providers, and underlying 
patient health issues. 
 In-Depth Case Studies
 Our 
survey results we
re supplemented by case studies
 that provide 
deeper insight into the 
factors that advance or impede 
the provision of 
family planning services at health centers.
 What 
became clear was the extent to which human and financial resources 
Œ attracting and retaining 
staff and being able to afford in the type
s of investments that enable comprehensive services 
Œ play a role in health centers™ family planning programs.  These resource
-based considerations 
may intensify when coupled with uncertainties created by the policy environments in which 
 Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 38  health centers ope
rate. The survey results show that health centers strive to make a basic set of 
family planning services available at all practice locations, but that building this capacity 

presents a challenge. 
 The 
health centers 
visited during the site review 
employed 
advance
d practice nurses (e.g., 
certified nurse midwives, family nurse practitioners) and other mid
-level practitioners as part of 
their practice teams.  Far fewer had OB
/GYNS.  Advance
d practice nurses and other mid
-level 
practitioners provide
d the majori
ty of reproductive health and family planning services, while 
physicians attend more complex patients.  
Limitations on resources have 
meant that 
health 
centers 
have had 
to 
be more efficient in
 their use of staff
, with 
mid-level practitioners work
ing
 at 
the
 top of their scope
 of licensure
. In some cases, however, particularly in
 smaller health centers, 
the expectation is that staff 
OB/GYNs will 
furnish a full range of reproductive health services
, from family planning t
hrough maternity care, while
 mid-level 
provide
rs 
remain responsible for 
other forms of 
primary
 health care
. This 
level of pressure on the physician member of the team 
may constrain the availability of preventive services because of high demands for 
maternity
 care 
and other services that only a 
physician can provide. 
  Staffing 
variations can be considerable from health center to health center
 and within 
health center sites. They appear to be
 predominantly a reflection of 
funding
, the ability to 
recruit 
and retain
 certain types of health professi
onals such 
as OB
/GYNs
 (in 
many communities health 
center
 family practice physicians have obstetrical 
privileges 
because of the extreme difficulty in 
recruiting OB
/GYNs)
, and specialized nursing and counseling staff.  
It is important to note t
hat 
in some he
alth centers, 
family practice physicians are expected to provide family planning 
services unless 
a gynecological pr
oblem
 is present
. A major challenge in
 this model of care is 
finding time to adequately train clinical staff in the specialty aspects of fami
ly planning and to 

keep them up
-to-date about new techniques and procedures. 
 Community influence
 and health centers™ perceptions of their communities 
 Communities 
Œ and health centers™ perceptions of their communities 
Œ matter in terms of 
how family plann
ing services are structured and the range of services offered. 
Health center
s are 
designed to
 reflect their communities; through their community board governance over staffing 
and policies, health centers 
bring a distinctive ﬁcommunity standardﬂ to their p
ractices
 and 
operations
, not in terms of the 
technical quality of the services furnished 
but 
 in the choices made 
about 
the range and depth of care offered
.  Health center operations rest on objective needs 
assessment
s and 
periodically updated 
planning
. But health centers also have accountability built 
into their operations through 
community 
board governance and extensive interaction with 
patients.  Inevitably, this
 effort to 
square the results of objective planning with the 
multiple 
demands 
of medically un
derserved communities, and to do so with limited resources, 
may lead 
some health centers to put less emphasis on a broad and robust family planning program.  
 Health centers™ community relationships play a special role in the case of health centers 
that ar
e long
-time members of their communities.  Staff 
at 
one such health center indicated that 
the demand for family planning is 
affected by the fact that many patients may not seek family 

planning services because they know the staff
.  Adolescent patients may 
feel uncomfortable in 
these situations, staff report, because 
their parents 
receive their care at the center and they have 

concerns about 
privacy and confidentiality
. Staff in numerous study sites reported that community attitudes were an issue because 
fam
ily planning was not well accepted; religious, 
cultural, and health literacy barriers were 
 Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 39  viewed as important. These responses shed additional light on why our survey results show 
significant variation in the depth and scope of health centers™ family
 plan
ning services
, particularly with respect to the use of counselors, the degree of outreach to hard
-to-serve 
populations such as adolescents, active measures to preserve confidentiality, and the range of 

procedures available. 
 Concerns over community beliefs
 also may inhibit efforts to aggressively 
secure additional funding to create more robust programs. Community concerns also may affect 

decisions to stock and make readily available inexpensive oral contraceptives as well as 

emergency contraception, 
the pro
vision of 
which 
may be
 strictly a matter of purchasing and 
stocking and 
do  not require advanced trained 
on-site
 personnel to furnish or administer
.  The Importance of 
Title X 
Funding
 The presence of Title X funding can be understood as both an indicator o
f health center 
willingness to grow robust programs as well as a factor in creating such programs.  Title X 

participation is not compulsory; health centers must desire to obtain grant funding, must pursue 

it, and must go through the additional responsibili
ties associated with compliance.  Title X 
funding also offers evidence of the ways in which 
additional resources and focus can achieve
, in 
terms of the scope and depth of 
on-site
 family planning procedures, the presence of counselors, 
the presence of speci
al outreach programs, and 
on-site
 treatment for certain
 STI
s.  The 
importance of additional targeted funding was evident in all of our interviews, because of the 

stress under which health centers operate and their obligation to offer primary health care ac
ross 

the age spectrum.  
The challenges of meeting community need clearly are lessened for any 

particular population or service when additional resources, such as Title X funding, can be 

secured.  Health centers may be particularly eager to pursue these res
ources when they 
sense 
both community need and desire for care as a result of the absence of alternatives, such as an 

independent Title X grantee. 
To illustrate this point, one interviewee at a health center in Texas 

noted that its
 Medicaid
-financed
 women™
s health program
87
Some health centers have been unwilling to seek Title X funding because of the more 
stringent requirements applicable under the program or have 
been unsuccessful because they 

could not meet program standards. Other health centers have developed successful working 

relationships with Title X service sites, which may be public health clinics or independent 

nonprofit clinics.  Where these relationship
s exist, respondents indicated that they have been 

longstanding and successful. In particular, health centers that either had sought and failed to 

obtain Title X funding or decided not to pursue funding noted that the counseling and outreach 

obligations un
der Title X proved to be particularly challenging.   In a few cases, these additional 

burdens, when added to the other practice stressors, led health centers to give up their Title X 

awards.  
  ﬁworks in tandem with 
[the state™s 
Title X
-funded program, which] 
serves as a safety net in a sense [for] anything not covered under 
the women™s health program.ﬂ 
 Health centers with a commitment to family planning may be 
particularly int
erested in pursuing Title X funding to help offset the cost of family planning 

services to uninsured patients. 
                                                   87 Our interviews were conducted prior to Texas™ decision to end  its Medicaid famil
y planning program.

 40  Availability of Medicaid 
 As our analysis of policy factors tha
t influence the comprehensiveness of care suggests, 
health centers are aware of the difference Medicaid makes.  Staff interviewed noted the barriers 
faced by their uninsured patients, particularly in the case of referral services and services that 

required
 a higher copay on health centers™ sliding fee schedules. Adolescents without insurance 
independent of their parents and who either would not or could not disclose treatment to their 

parents reportedly faced barriers to contraceptive access because they co
uld not afford oral 
contraceptives that were not dispensed 
on-site
, but instead had to be filled through a separate 
pharmacy prescription requiring payment.   
 Even where Medicaid is present, other factors appeared to leave patients effectively 
disinsured 
for essential treatment.  For example, Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care 

plans would not be able to fill their STI treatment prescriptions at a health center pharmacy that 

is out
-of-network, thereby increasing the likelihood of delayed access
 to care.  A similar out
-of-network concern was raised by respondents in the context of laboratory tests that a health center 

is not authorized to process because its laboratory services are considered out
-of-network.  
 Similarly, h
ealth centers may not be
 able to fill ST
I treatment prescriptions 
on-site
;  this 
can be true even for patients covered by Medicaid in cases in which the health center believes 

that the
ir state Medicaid
 program excludes
 coverage of
 a treatment or requires that prescriptions 
be fil
led in specific locations.  Another notable area of concern for health centers
 and other 
safety
-net providers is 
the cost of lab tests that need to be processed externally and whose costs 
become unaffordable to 
many 
uninsured patients
.  Most significant, a
ccording to respondents, were the barriers created by the high cost of 
IUD and sterilization services and the low payment rates available for these services under 

insurance plans.  In the case of Medicaid, one would assume that cost would not be an issue 

because of the special FQHC payment rate that applies to both FQHC services (services of 

physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical psychologist and social work 

services, and ancillary services) as well as other ambulatory care furnishe
d by the health center. 

But our interviews underscored the extent to which state Medicaid programs appear to exclude 

numerous types of ambulatory procedures from the FQHC payment formula, instead paying for 

these services on a 
per
-procedure
 basis and at a 
deeply discounted rate.  
 This approach to 
Medicaid 
payment 
in turn has spillover effects on the entire health 
center operation. Whatever 
care is furnished to Medicaid patients must also be made available to 

privately insured and uninsured patients, for wh
om the revenue flow is
 even more
 deeply 
depressed
, because of the complete lack of coverage 
in the case of uninsured patients or the 
presence of 
high deductibles and cost
-sharing
, along with 
numerous payment exclusions
, in the 
case of privately insured pat
ients.  In other words, the absence of 
FQHC payment 
principles for 
all family planning services, c
oupled with the absence of 
any 
payment in the case of uninsured 
and under
-insured patients, results in significant limitations on health centers™ ability to o
ffer a 
robust service. 
 For health centers with Title X, these limitations are not as substantial
, since t
he family 
planning grant will often cover services that Medicaid does not.  However, the issue of cost 

barriers frustrated all th
e study sites, even t
hose that receive Title X funding. While Title X 
provided added flexibility, even that funding source had limits: 
     Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 41  ﬁ–Our providers feel more empowered to ask [what the patient wants]–. We™ve 
been given more flexibili
ty in how we administer that
 because 
of the Title X 
funds.  ﬁI think you should have the same flexibility as if you weren™t in the 

fami
ly planning program to . . . 
say (and this is my opinion) I need to discuss birth 
control, what are my options, versus I need Mirena
 [because it is the covere
d contraceptive]
.ﬂ  
 Adolescent services 
 All of the interviews underscored health centers™ concern about the need for special 
programs for adolescents
, as well as the 
challenges in providing comprehensive and confidential 
care for adolescents.  
Some of th
is concern may be the result of health centers™ lack of clarity 
regarding state confidentiality policies, or the absence of policies related to separate billing for 

adolescent family planning services in order to maintain confidentiality.  
For some 
of the 
respondents, 
the initial financial intake, as well as the
 financial methods for accommodating 
teens™ preference not to use their parents™ insurance
, pose 
significant obstacles to family planning 
and reproductive health services
.  Health centers also report
ed that teens may not realize 
that 
low
-cost, confidential care is available through the health center. 
 Although the survey results suggested a fairly high level of involvement in school health, 
most of the case study sites did
 not provide any school
-based
 clinical services
 or school
-based 
sex education. 
The lack of partnership with local schools was seen as a lost opportunity by 

several 
case study sites.  
One 
study site did maintain school
-based clinics but was prohibited 
from furnishing 
on-site
 contracept
ives.  
 Referral arrangements 
and networks 
 Interviewees recognized 
the importance of 
well
-established
 referral systems as
 critical to 
enhancing family planning access and reported both 
formal and informal referral relationships 

with family planning clinic
s, local hospitals, 
and other 
health care organizations
. Referral 
services typically included vasectomies and female sterilizations, follow
-up on irregular Pap 
smears, and 
pregnancy care. 
Some 
but not all referral arrangements included explicit agreements 
to make referrals available on a sliding fee basis.   Interviewees considered referral arrangements 

a strategy for making services more accessible but also recognized the financial limitations of 

such arrangements because of the costs associated with under
writing referral care: 
ﬁI think that 
there are some services that are a bit more expensive, and I think that there is room for us to 

perhaps strengthen that 
relationship with our partners . . . 
 in terms of providing those services, 
not that we can™t, but 
I think in a financially more sustainable manner, because we™re taking the 

hit for it [the cost of the services], not shifting the cost to the patients.ﬂ
 The survey results suggest that 
healt
h center referral relationships with 
family planning 
clinics are 
slightly more likely to be outgoing than incoming, and our case studies help explain 

this finding.  
Health centers appear likely to recognize the need for a special type of family 

planning service and 
thus 
refer (such as confidential teen services or servi
ces that are furnished 
free of charge rather than on a discount). At the same time, interviewees noted that family 

planning clinics understood that the health center was an affordable source of referral treatment 

for non
-reproductive primary health care. 
  Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 42  Diverse 
patient 
needs
  All of the sites noted the
 provision of care for 
specific sub
-populations
, such as those who
 face
 language 
access barriers 
or who possess 
unique cultural and religious beliefs that pose 
challenges for providing reproductive health an
d family planning services. For example, one 
health center with growing Asian and African immigrant populations has dedicated some of its 

Title X funding and additional grant funds to 
family planning outreach tailored to these specific 
populations. 
Another
 health center reported challenges 
arising from a changing patient 
population and
 was facing 
a dramatic increase in low
-income, uninsured, Hispanic families with 
higher fertility rates. These demographic changes
, according to the staff,
 necessitated more 
interpretation and case management services.
 In other
 cases, participants suggested that the
 lack 
of information and knowledge a
bout family planning among immigrant groups created additional 
service challenges.  In these cases, staff cited a critical need f
or additional resources. 
 Discussion and Recommendations 
 Discussion
 The major role played by health centers in the lives of 
low
-income
, medically 
underserved women underscores the importance of further strengthening their ability to furnish 

comprehensive 
preventive family planning services.  This study points to the factors that may 
help determine the extent to which health centers will be able to grow programs that are more 

fully responsive to women™s health needs.  Many of these factors are financial, si
nce the 
evidence suggests that more generous Medicaid eligibility levels, coupled with targeted 

financing 
through Title X in order to support expanded staff and services, 
are effective in 
encouraging 
the growth of health center capacity.  Expanded Medicaid
 eligibility under the 
Affordable Care Act, along with 
grant
-based investment resources, furnish the revenue stream 
essential to the enhancement of service capabilities. 
 Other constraints, including the recruitment and retention of clinical and counseling
 staff, 
as well as supportive state policy environments, also play significant roles in determining the 

depth and range of health center programs.  Still other factors, such as how state policies shape 

access to care among adolescents, including less restr
ictive parental consent laws and Medicaid 
policies that ensure privacy in the use of Medicaid coverage to secure access to family planning 

services, are also highly important.  To a great degree, community attitudes toward family 

planning, as well as healt
h centers™ perceptions of community support for robust and accessible 
programs, also play important roles.  
 All health centers offer some level of family planning, and the great majority make what 
we term
 a ﬁtypicalﬂ package of family planning services av
ailable to their patients at numerous 
service sites.  But the results of this study show that 
the availability of a typical range of family 

planning services 
is also influenced by 
access to staffing and to 
resources in the form of 
both 

grant
-based investme
nt funding, along with 
third party financing
 needed to sustain more robust 
services
.  These resources become especially important where the providers studied are part of 
the safety net and therefore have an obligation to serve uninsured patients in their c
ommunities.  
Previous studies of uninsured patient rates at health centers in the wake of the Massachusetts 

health reform plan show that these numbers not only will remain high but also will grow as a 

proportion of the total uninsured population, as other 
sources of uncompensated care shrink.  
    Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 43  These study results also reveal
 important gaps
 in care at health centers. Particularly 
notable is the lack of 
on-site
, free oral contraceptives, 
as well as the absence of a 
broader range 
of 
on-site
 long
-lasting con
traceptive methods, along with 
a level and intensity of counseling 
needed to make family planning effective, and outreach to special populations.  
 Of special concern are
 Medicaid coverage and payment policies
, which, as this study 
suggests, may permit pay
ment for 
less than the full range of necessary diagnostic and treatment 
services 
needed in a comprehensive approach to family planning.  Expanded eligibility for 
Medicaid is the critical first step.  But equally important are payment policies that assure 
adequate levels of funding to maintain a full array of diagnostic and treatment services, along 
with exemptions from the otherwise applicable coverage restrictions that accompany modern 

insurance products. These coverage restrictions can include non
-coverag
e for ﬁout
-of-networkﬂ 
diagnostic tests as well as coverage exclusions for prescribed drugs and devices obtained from an 

ﬁout
-of-networkﬂ provider.  In light of the documented cost
-effectiveness of family planning, 
these types of coverage and payment restr
ictions, which inevitably create access barriers among 
a low
-income
 population, merit reconsideration.   
 Of importance as well is the avoidance by 
Qualified Health Plans sold in Health 
insurance Marketplaces
 of coverage and payment policies 
that exclude s
afety net family planning 
providers and that exclude needed treatments and services on an ﬁout
-of-networkﬂ basis.   In a 
world in which increasing emphasis is placed on health insurance payment methods that produce 

value, broader and more inclusive payment
 principles that are sensitive to patient care 
preferences and that encourage comprehensive programs by 
safety net providers of family 

planning services 
Œ both health centers and independent Title X clinics 
Œ  would appear to be 
warranted. Such policies wo
uld encourage the most 
inclusive care possible, including access to 

all FDA
-approved forms of contraception, 
on-site
 STI testing and treatment, extensive 
counseling in family planning methods and adherence, and patient management approaches that 

promote ac
cess to specialized services such as sterilization and vasectomies. 
 The Affordable Care Act contains four major advances that will both expand coverage 
for women and help str
engthen community health centers™ preventive services programs, 
including family 
planning. 
The first advance is the Act™s Medicaid reforms
, extending 
eligibility 
to an additional 17
 million nonelderly persons 
by 2022. 
It is the nation™s poorest populations who 

remain at the core of the health center mission, and for this reason, the Me
dicaid reforms are 
anticipated to be particularly transformational for the future of the health centers program, 

allowing health centers to realize major improvements in the proportion of insured patients they 

serve.  Furthermore, the Medicaid expansions a
re especially 
important 
for women; the Kaiser 
Family Foundation has estimated that the Medicaid expansion 
will cover as much as 
55% of the 
nation™s 19 million uninsured women beginning in 2014.
88
The second major advance is establishment 
of subsidized cove
rage through Health 
Insurance 
Marketplaces.  W
omen are
 likewise
 expected to gain significantly from
 the affordable

Kaiser estimates that 36
% of all uninsured women will qualify 
for subsidized coverage throug
h Qualified Healt
h Plans.
89
The third major advance is the design of coverage itself, which emphasizes benefits of 
special importance to women™s health. Women whose Medicaid entitlement rests on  eligibility 
under Medicaid™s traditional rules will 
continue to 
receive full 
coverage for family planning 

services and supplies, as well as other preventive services covered under state Medicaid plans.  

For newly eligible women, the Medicaid expansion means entitlement to ﬁ
Alternative Benefit 
Plan
ﬂ coverage, which 
include the full 
array of women™s preventive benefits, including family 
planning education and counseling and all FDA
-approved contraceptives, without cost
-sharing. 
   The fourth and final advance is the major investment in health center growth that, when 
fully implemented, 
is expected to virtually double the number of patients served by health 

centers.  
Because
 the Act preserves both the special Medicaid FQHC payment ru
les and extends 
those rules to Qualified H
ealth 
Plans sold in 
Health Insurance Marketplaces, the impact of 
this 
new market on health center operations will be considerable. 
 Our recommendations rest on this changing coverage landscape, as well as the findings 
from this study.  They are 
consistent with 
the major areas of focus in health reform that are now 

so mu
ch in evidence: 
the heightened
 focus on improving the value and efficiency of health care
; a focus on health investments that yield long
-term cost containment;
 a focus on improving access 
to primary health care; 
and 
finally, 
an intensified focus on 
enhanci
ng 
preventive health services 
for women
.   Recommendations 
 Our recommendations fall into four major areas: policy guidance; practice re
-design and 
quality improvement; value
-based purchasing; and collaboration. In our view, these 
recommendations are highl
y complementary; they work best in tandem by providing the broad 
policy basis for performance improvement, a mechanism for testing, implementing, and 

communicating improvement efforts, and incentives for undertaking such efforts.  We also 

discuss 
areas whe
re further research is 
needed
, in order to help guide the transformation process.
 1. Develop Core Health Center Family Planning Guidance
 that Adapts 
to 
Health Center
 Practice Settings 
Emerging HHS Policy on Family Planning Practice 
  In 2013
, the United St
ates Department of Health and Human
 Services is expected to issue
 comprehensive 
family planning guidelines. These guidelines are expected to apply to 
the Title X 
family planning program while also setting 
clear
er recommendations 
for other providers of 
fami
ly planning services
 beyond Title X grantees
. The guidelines
 are expected to be 
comprehensive, addressing all aspects of family planning practice including the recommended 

components of primary reproductive health care, recommended practice approaches for 
hard
-to-serve populations, contraceptive recommendations, recommendations related to education and 
                                                  89 Id.
   Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 45  counseling, recommended standards for specialized procedures, and other matters.   In the case 
of large and comprehensive providers of family planning servic
es including health centers that 
operate very large p
rograms, the recommendations might be appropriate in their entirety. 
For 
smaller 
health centers, for whom 
famil
y planning services represent one
 element of a broader 
primary care practice, 
the recommenda
tions might require adaptation. 
 The question of what should be expected of all health centers 
regardless of size, as well 
as what might be expected of the largest health centers, is key.  Recommendations presumably 

would cover 
on-site
 practice
s (i.e., wha
t is always expected to be available 
at one or more health 
center sites) as well as what types of w
ritten, formal referral arrangement
s would be appropriate,
 as opposed to informal referral practice
. Articulating health center expectations, and tailoring 
those expectations to the variable conditions of health center practice, emerges from this study as 
a matter of great significance
. What a health center of a certain size and staffing configuration 
should ﬁtypicallyﬂ provide where preventive services relate
d to women™s reproductive health are 
concerned, emerges as a major question of primary care access and quality.  To be sure, local 

conditions may make uniform expectations difficult to achieve, but we believe that it is advisable 

to set initial expectation
s clearly. 
 For example, a central question
 that arose 
concerns 
on-site provision of 
oral 
contraceptives, the most commo
nly used form of birth control.  
Virtually all health centers 

prescribe oral contraceptives of course, but only abou
t half dispense 
on-site; the remainder 
presumably write
 prescriptions 
that must be filled elsewhere. 
Certain financial considerations 
may cause health centers to limit their role to prescribing and not dispensing oral contraceptives; 

for example, 
as noted, 
women insured throu
gh Medicaid or private insurance may be covered for 
prescribed birth control oral medications only through network pharmacies.  At the same time, 

the cost of standard oral contraceptives is so low that the 
consequences
 of not being able to 
provide immediat
e access to treatment 
may 
significantly outweigh the cost of 
providing 
on-site
 access. 
 Furthermore, where the expectation is 
on-site
 access to certain prescriptions, such an 
expectation (coupled with expectations on the part of Medicaid agencies regarding
 the 
accessibility of family planning services) may add to health centers™ negotiating leverage in 

setting payment policies with managed care plans. 
  Anot
her example 
where adaptation of broad HHS family planning policies to health 
center settings is conce
rned involves the
 use of long
-acting reversible
 contraceptives
 (LARCs)
 that require insertion by specially trained clinical staff.  
LARCS, such as implants or IUDs
, are 
highly effective contraceptive methods
, and as such, making these technologies availabl
e to 
low
-income
 and medically underserved women is vital.  
However, 
making 
them
 available takes 
financing, specially trained staff, and a clinically appropriate practice environment.  A smaller 

health center may lack the start
-up financing to recruit and t
rain staff and acquire 
the higher cost 
supplies; at the same time, it may be located in or near a community in which a large clinical 

program offering comprehensive family planning services in fact is available to its patients, 

particularly as their insura
nce status improves. In such a situation, the answer to the problem of 
access may lie in the development and adoption of formally negotiated affiliation agreements 

under which, among other 
matters, referral protocols are 
established along with information 

exchange protocols that reflect all applicable privacy and confidentiality requirements.   Using 

negotiated agreements in the case of more complex family planning services may make the most 

sense based on health center capacity, the availability of health 
professionals, patient 
preferences, and cost efficiencies.   
  Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 46  However, 
before these types of practice modifications and contractua
l negotiations can 
take place, 
health centers need performance policies that clearly signal what is expected of them 
as a matt
er of either 
on-site
 practice
 or formal referral arrangement
.  Many may then need 
assistanc
e and support in adopting
 practice re
-design innovations or in negotiating such 
agreements.  Which of the pending HHS recommended family planning services should be 
an 

on-site
 expectation of all health centers, and which should be cover
ed by formal referral plans 
should 
be addressed, as well as identifying which types of services can continue to be handled 
via a more informal referral system.
 In keeping with the enorm
ous investment in family planning
-related standard
-setting 
already underway at HHS, we recommend that HRSA sponsor a 
family planning standards 

adaptation working group 
comprised of experts in family planning along with experts in health 

center clinical pra
ctice and program administration. 
Particularly i
mportant 
will 
 be the adaptation 
of new 
HHS 
standards 
into health center practice. 
Such a workgroup woul
d be ideally 
positioned 
to develop a more detailed set of translational 
guidance that takes 
a tiered app
roach to policy 
implementation, develops 
practice
 policies that are customized to health centers and that speak to 
the full range of health center practice 
considerations. 
 This translational step in adapting 
emerging family practice guidelines to health c
enter practice is critical to essentially closing the 
loop and assuring that the HHS guidelines are adapted to the world of health centers.
     2. Establish a Family Planning Practice Re
-Design and Quality Improvement Effort as Part 
of an Overall Primary H
ealth Care Quality Initiative
 Aligning well with any effort to adapt clinical practice guidelines to health center practice 
would 
be a more detailed practice re
-design initiative that addresses all phases of family planning 
practice in health center settin
gs.  Essential to this undertaking is a well
-balanced group 
consisting of persons knowledgeable about all phases of health center practice as well as experts 

in family planning and patient and consumer representatives who can jointly develop detailed 

pract
ice guidance addressing all elements of a sound family planning practice in a health center 
context.  Key issues that might be addressed include
: 1) practices that promote comprehensive 
on-site
 services
; 2) model referral agreements for more specialized ca
re and interventions 
requiring staff with advanced training and knowledge
; 3) guidance for counseling and advisin
g hard
-to-serve populations and
 methods for communicating with boards and communities
; 4) the 
use of procedures that assure appropriate informa
tion exchange while adhering to all federal and 
state privacy and confidentiality standards
; 5) payment practices that best incentivize practice 
modifications needed to strengthen family planning services, including payment for 
on-site
 services, education 
and counseling, patient outreach and support, and investments in staff 
training and education
; and 6)
 the
 identification of performance metrics aimed at measuring 
health center progress in practice modification and the health results of such modification e
fforts.  
 The results of this type of practice re
-design effort could be disseminated in a number of 
ways: through in
-person trainings; training webinars; the use of written and multi
-media 
communication ; and the establishment of performance improvement p
ractice groups comprised 

of health centers across the country who come together to develop performance improvement 

plans for clinical practice and health care administration.

 47  3. Bring
 Value
-Based Purchasing and ﬁHealth Homeﬂ Techniques to 
Family Planning
  A hallmark of The Affordable Care Act is its emphasis on payment reform.  The Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) within CMS is 
charged with developing and 
testing new payment models that have the potential to improve the quality and effi
ciency of 
health care while holding down long
-term costs. 
 In light of the high value of comprehensive 
family planning access 
Œ indeed, so valuable that actuaries consider contraceptive services to be 
a zero
-cost item for insurers 
Œ it makes sense to pursu
e a value
-based purchasing strategy for 
family planning services.  By ﬁvalue
-basedﬂ we mean a purchasing strategy that 
is designed to 
hold down overall prices while advancing quality.  This approach to health care purchasing, 
which 
tests cert
ain types of p
ayment techniques
 such as payment bundling
 of 
episode
-based 
treatments
, should be readily adaptable to a 
family planning context.  Servic
es of critical 
importance to a
 payment bundle 
include counseling
 and educational services, a full array of 
on-site
 scre
ening, diagnostic and treatment services, and 
on-site
 access to all FDA approved forms 
of contraception.  This type of payment model also might 
override treatment limitations and 
exclusions in the case of providers that 
participate in 
a bundling demonstrat
ion and 
are 
effectively 
recognized by payers as qualified to serve as family planning health homes 
because 
they offer 
the full range of family planning services. 
  Testing new methods for bundling family planning payments and for introducing the 
episode
-of-treatment concept into ongoing family planning delivery might 
be expected to 
produce two
 effects.  The first would be to broaden the array of treatments available in health 
center 
and other family planning settings 
by explicitly 
incentivizing 
their provis
ion, much as 
Title X grants currently act as a stimulus to quality improvement.  The second effect would be 

more long term in nature
.  By strengthening
 family planning performance
 at health centers as 
well as in other safety net settings such as Title X cl
inics
, payment
 reforms would allow payers 
and 
providers 
to test innovations that might carry over into other areas of primary health care 
practice, such as the 
ongoing management of other health needs. 
 4. Foster
 Health Center/Title X Family Planning Progr
am Collaborations 
 Research suggests the importance of formal affiliation and referral arrangements.  
For 
years health centers and Title X family planning providers have worked alongside one another, 

both at the community level and as a matter of national 
policy.  Both programs are joined 

through the Public Health Service Act. Both are administered by HHS
, and they share mission, 
overall operational structures, and a great reliance on Medicaid payment policy.  Both programs
 stand to be 
transformed by the Af
fordable Care Act™s insurance expansions, innovations in 
coverage design for family planning, and emphasis on payment reform.  We believe that it is 

time for the two programs to seek greater collaborative alignment when possible.  
 The findings in this rep
ort point to the significant number of health centers that also are 
Title X grantees. The findings also point to the enormously important role of Title X in 

strengthening health center performance through payment incentives coupled with explicit 

performanc
e expectations.  In many communities health centers effectively also play an integral 
role in the success of Title X because they make up its core provider community.
 At the same time, the evidence in this study suggests that in most communities health 
centers and Title X grantees remain independent of one another. This choice to co
-exist 
makes 
sense in many cases
, since it represents a means of fostering more access points, more choice in 
 Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 48  providers, and 
as 
a means of separating out a one™s general family p
ractice provider from a 
provider of confidential family planning services. 
 Both models are flourishing
 as products of community choices, provider choices, and 
providers™ 
perception
 of patient needs and preferences.  Where health centers and Title X clinic
s exist as independent providers, it is also evident from our findings that the two providers 
typically maintain active referral arrangements, both formal and informal.  These arrangements 

work in both directions; that is, patients who need family planning
 services beyond those offered 
at a health center, or who prefer to maintain a separate provider relationship for family planning 

purposes, may be referred to a Title X program. Conversely, patients of Title X clinics who need 

generalized primary health ca
re typically would be referred to health centers for ongoing care 

and treatment.  
 It is evident that despite the informal relationships that have 
developed 
around the 
country, 
formalized policies have not
 fostered such relationships or promoted their form
ation.  
We believe that translating what has been an informal set of working relationships into a more 

formal menu of best practices, with supporting documents and examples of potential affiliation 

agreements, offers a means of further building on these co
llaborations.  Collaboration efforts 

might focus on special populations, such as the joint development of programs for adolescents.  

They might also focus on referrals for specialized family planning services or
 joint relationship 
-- as part 
of a health ce
nter medical homes demonstration 
Œ to develop effective family planning 
services for patients with serious physical or mental health conditions.   A formal collaboration 

initiative also might focus on best practices in the area of patient information excha
nge to assure 
optimal  
data transfer 
 for purposes of 
enhancing 
treatment quality
, while guaranteeing HIPAA 
compliance as well as provider compliance with state privacy and confidentiality statutes.  The 

two HHS agencies that oversee the programs might use
 the o
pportunity
 of the forthcoming 
family planning practice standards, as well as the Affordable Care Act™s emphasis on 
both 
family 

planning access
 and the expanded use of health information technology
, to launch a best
 practices initiative that guides he
alth centers and Title X agencies in finding and establishi
ng 
working collaboration models.  This would include
 not only identifying the models, but
 also
 preparing model affiliation agreements that address issues ranging from joint program 

development
, to 
information exchange
, to joint practices aimed at 
the participation of 
high
-need 
patients in medical homes demonstration
s.    Recommendations for Further Research
 The findings from this study point to much that can be done to further strengthen health 
cent
er performance in the area of family planning.   But, as is the case with all research, the 
results of this study point 
also point to important research opportunities.
   1. Study h
ow do patients use health center family planning services and 
what are 
patient 
preferences
. One such opportunity is further research into the health care preferences 
of health center patients in the area of family planning.  The large amount of family 

planning services furnished by health centers underscores their integral role in 

creating points of access for their patients.  At the same time, no study ever has 
looked at why patients choose health centers for their family planning needs, what 

they value in such care arrangements or would like to see changed, or how they 
 Health Centers and Family Plan
ning 
 49  perceive heal
th centers as responding to their needs.   Such research could be 
enormously helpful in efforts to tailor family planning policies to health center 
practice environments as well as initiatives aimed at practice re
-design. 
 2. Conduct a
n in
-depth analysis of M
edicaid FQHC payment policies and family 
planning.  
 Surprisingly little is known about how Medicaid agencies and Medicaid 
managed care organizations today account for certain costs associated with  effective 

family planning programs, including payments fo
r such activities as education and 

counseling, 
on-site
 dispensing of contraceptives, and payment for the adoption of new 
family planning technologies and their incorporation into health center practice. A 

more detailed examination of how health centers cap
ture these costs as part of their 
FQHC payment
-related cost reporting responsibilities, as well as how agency and 
managed care payment caps and limitations may affect the adoption of new 

technologies, would significantly strengthen the evidence base for pa
yment reform. 
 3. Study the c
ommunity environment for health center practice improvement in the area 
of family planning.  
Another area of research is community perception
 of family 
planning and health center practice
. In conducting this study we experienced 
significant resistance to discussion about family planning services and activities 
among a number of health centers. We were frequently told that were a health center 

to operate a more enriched family planning program, this would run counter to 

community pr
eferences and furthermore, that even participation in research to better 
understand health center practices and choices 
may
 be problematic.  We conclude that 
this issue needs to be 
examined
 in order to better understand the community 
environment in which h
ealth centers operate.   Community is a powerful concept in 

the world of health centers; health centers grow organically from the communities 

that seek health center funding and that govern health centers once they are 

established.  
Popular support for fam
ily planning is high, even among people who 
identify themselves as religious
. Thus
, we believe that any effort to systematically 
improve health cent
er family planning performance 
would build on a deeper 
understanding of 
 both community perception of the pr
ovision of 
 family planning 
services
 by health centers
 and 
the 
steps 
that 
might be taken to 
expand
 these vital 
services 
in all communities.
