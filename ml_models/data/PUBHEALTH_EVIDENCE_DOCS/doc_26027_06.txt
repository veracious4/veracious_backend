Researchers are testing 52 vaccines in clinical trials on humans, and at least 86 preclinical vaccines are under active investigation in animals.
 The first vaccine safety trials in humans started in March, and now 10 have reached the final stages of testing.
 Some of these trials will fail, and others may end without a clear result.
 But a few vaccines may succeed in stimulating the immune system to produce effective antibodies against the virus.
 Here is the status of all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans, along with a selection of promising vaccines still being tested in animals.
 While these vaccines may potentially prevent infection, they cannot cure the disease.
