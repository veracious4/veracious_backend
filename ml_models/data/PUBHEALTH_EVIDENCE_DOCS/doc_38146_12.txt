(a) He must move onto the field of play or the end z
one as far as the inside of the field numerals prior to
 
the snap to be a legal substitution. If he does not
, and is on the field of play or end zone at the tim
e of 
a legal snap, he is an illegal substitute. 
 (b) If he approaches the huddle and communicates wi
th a teammate, he is required to participate in at 
least one play before being withdrawn. Violations of 
this rule may be penalized for unsportsmanlike 
conduct. 
Note: The intent of the rule is to prevent teams from 
using simulated substitutions to confuse an opponen
t, 
while still permitting a player(s) to enter and leave 
without participating in a play in certain situations
, such 
as a change in a coaching decision on fourth down, e
ven though he has approached the huddle and 
communicated with a teammate. Similarly, if a player 
who
participated in the previous play leaves the 
playing field by mistake, and returns to the playing 
field prior to the snap, he is not required to reach the
 
inside of the field numerals, provided that the defe
nse has the opportunity to match up with him. Howeve
r, 
a substitute (i.e., someone who did not participate 
in the previous play) is required to reach the inside o
f 
the field numerals. 
WITHDRAWN PLAYERS 
Article 6

A player or players who have been replaced must leave t
he playing field or end zone on their own 
team's side between the end lines prior to the next s
nap, free kick, or fair-catch kick. 
DISQUALIFIED AND SUSPENDED PLAYERS 
Article 7

A player must be withdrawn and substituted for when he
 is disqualified (see 12-2, 12-3) or 
suspended (see 5-4). A suspended player may re-enter a
fter at least one legal snap, provided that the 
reason for his suspension has been corrected. A disqual
ified player must leave the playing field enclosure 
and go to the team locker room within a reasonable tim
e. 
PENALTIES FOR ILLEGAL SUBSTITUTION OR WITHDRAWAL 
Article 8  Penalties for illegal substitution or with
drawal are: 
(a) For 12 or more players in the offensive huddle (
whistle blown immediately and ball remains 
dead): Loss of five yards from the succeeding spot. 
(b) For a substitute entering the field during a live
 ball: Loss of five yards. 
(c) For interference with the play by a substitute who
 enters the field during a live ball: Palpably 
unfair act (see 12-3-3). 
(d) For an offensive substitute who does not move on
to the field as far as the inside of the field 
numerals: Loss of five yards from the previous spot. 
(e) For an offensive substitute who moves onto the f
ield inside the field numerals and leaves 
without participating in one play: Unsportsmanlike Condu
ct. 
(f) For a withdrawn player on the field at the snap, 
free kick, or fair-catch kick: Loss of five 
yards from the previous spot. 
(g) For a withdrawn player clearing the field on the
 opponents' side or across an end line: Loss 
of five yards from the previous spot. 
(h) For illegal return of a suspended player: Loss of 
five yards from the previous spot if 
discovery is made while the ball is in play, or five
 yards from the succeeding spot if 
discovered between downs, in which case the ball rema
ins dead. 
(i) For return of a disqualified player: Loss of 15 ya
rds from the previous spot if discovery is 
made while the ball is in play, or 15 yards from the 
succeeding spot if discovered between 
downs, in which case the ball remains dead, and, in 
either case, exclusion from the playing 
field enclosure. 
 SUPPLEMENTAL NOTE: 
If the illegal return of a player is not discovered unt
il the end of a down, but prior to the start of the n
ext one, 
enforcement is from the previous spot when definitely 
known. Otherwise, enforcement is from the 
succeeding spot as a foul between downs (see 14-5).
 PROCEDURE FOLLOWING TIMEOUT OR CHANGE OF POSSESSION 
Article 9

Following a timeout or change of possession, the bal
l will not be declared ready for play until the 
offense has brought 11 players into its huddle inside
 the inbounds lines (hashmarks). If the offensive te
am 
refuses to leave the sideline prior to the ball being 
declared ready for play, it will be warned once. 
Thereafter, the offense will be penalized 15 yards for 
unsportsmanlike conduct. 
 Penalty: For Unsportsmanlike Conduct after a warning
: Loss of 15 yards from the succeeding spot. 
OFFICIAL NFL PLAYING RULES 24
 If there is an offensive substitution that occurs aft
er the offensive team has broken its huddle, the play
 clock will 
be stopped, and the defense will be allowed an oppo
rtunity to matchup. 
DEFENSIVE MATCHUPS FOLLOWING SUBSTITUTIONS 
Article 10

If a substitution is made by the offense, the offen
se shall not be permitted to snap the ball until the
 
defense has been permitted to respond with its substi
tutions. While in the process of a substitution (or 
simulated substitution), the offense is prohibited f
rom rushing quickly to the line of scrimmage and 
snapping the ball in an obvious attempt to cause a 
defensive foul (i.e., too many men on the field). I
f, in the 
judgment of the officials, this occurs, the followin
g procedure will apply: 
 (a) The Umpire will stand over the ball until the Re
feree deems that the defense has had a reasonable 
time to complete its substitutions. 
 (b) If a play takes place and a defensive foul for 
too many players on the field results, no penalties 
will be 
enforced, except for personal fouls and unsportsmanlike
 conduct, and the down will be replayed. At 
this time, the Referee will notify the head coach th
at any further use of this tactic will result in a pen
alty 
for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
Note: The quick-snap rule does not apply after the tw
o-minute warning of either half, or if there is not a 
substitution by the offense. 
(c) On a fourth-down punting situation, the Referee a
nd the Umpire will not allow a quick snap that 
prevents the defense from having a reasonable time to
 complete its substitutions. This applies 
throughout the entire game. 
UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT 
Article 11

Using entering substitutes, legally returning players, 
substitutes on sidelines, or withdrawn players 
to confuse opponents, or lingering by players leaving 
the field when being replaced by a substitute, is 
unsportsmanlike conduct. See 12-3-1-k. The offense i
s prevented from sending simulated substitutions 
onto the field toward its huddle and returning them to
 the sideline without completing the substitution i
n an 
attempt to confuse the defense. 
 Penalty: For Unsportsmanlike Conduct after a warning
: Loss of 15 yards from the succeeding spot. 
Section 3 Changes in Position 
REPORTING CHANGE OF POSITION 
Article 1

An offensive player wearing the number of an ineligibl
e pass receiver (50-79 and 90-99) is permitted 
to line up in the position of an eligible pass recei
ver (1-49 and 80-89), and an offensive player wearing 
the 
number of an eligible pass receiver is permitted to lin
e up in the position of an ineligible pass receiver,
 
provided that he immediately reports the change in his
 eligibility status to the Referee, who will inform t
he 
defensive team. 
He must participate in such eligible or ineligible po
sition as long as he is continuously in the game, b
ut prior to 
each play he must again report his status to the Refe
ree, who will inform the defensive team. The game 
clock shall not be stopped, and the ball shall not 
be put in play until the Referee takes his normal pos
ition. 
RETURNING TO ORIGINAL POSITION 
Article 2

A player who has reported a change in his eligibility 
status to the Referee is permitted to return to a 
position indicated by the eligibility status of his
 number after: 
(a) a team timeout; 

(b) the end of a quarter;  

(c) the two-minute warning;  
 (d) a foul;  

 (e) a replay challenge;  

 (f) a touchdown;  

 (g) a completed kick from scrimmage;  

 (h) a change of possession; or 

 (i) if the player has been withdrawn for one legal sn
ap. A player withdrawn for one legal snap may re-
enter at a position indicated by the eligibility sta
tus of his number, unless he again reports to the 
Referee that he is assuming a position other than tha
t designated by the eligibility status of his 
number. 
OFFICIAL NFL PLAYING RULES 25
 A.R. 5.1

Offensive tackle A1 is legally shifted to the backf
ield and is then withdrawn. He returns before the n
ext snap to 
a tackle position. 
Ruling:
Illegal. He must stay out one play, or have his tea
m request a team time out. See 5-3-2 and 7-2-4-
Exc. 
Article 3

Each offensive and defensive team is permitted 
no more than
 one player on the field with a speaker 
in his helmet. 
Each team is permitted to have a maximum of three act
ive radio receivers to be used on 
offense by its quarterbacks, and a maximum of two act
ive radio receivers to be used on defense by 
players who have been designated as a primary and back
up user.
 Clubs that have a player whose principal position is 
as a non-quarterback (e.g., wide receiver, running back)
 
and who also is used as a quarterback from time to tim
e must have two helmets for that player√êone with 
and one without radio components. 
When 
a quarterback
 enters the game for the first time, or re-enters the gam
e if he has previously been in the 
game and removed, he must report to the Referee.  
Whenever the backup defensive user enters 
or re-enters 
the game wearing a helmet with a speaker, he must 
report to the Umpire. If the primary defensive user subse
quently re-enters the game wearing a helmet with 
a speaker, he must report to the Umpire. 
If the primary and backup players have been removed from
 the 
game, no other player may wear the radio speaker in his 
helmet. Teams must use other methods to 
communicate signals to their players. 
 It is not necessary that the offensive player with th
e speaker in his helmet receive the snap.  
 For special teams' plays, only one player per team wi
th a receiver will be permitted on the field
. The coach-to-player system is not subject to the equ
ity rule. In the event one club experiences a coach-t
o-
player radio system malfunction or failure, the other c
lub does not have to shut down its system and may 
continue using it. However, if the coaches' intercom 
system has been completely shut down on both 
sidelines pursuant to the equity rule, all coaches' h
eadsets must be removed, and radio communications 
from the sidelines to the field must be conducted by
 walkie-talkie only. 
All players that have radio components in their helmet
 must have a decal, supplied by the League, displaye
d on 
the midline of the rear of the helmet. Players who ha
ve speakers in their helmets must be identified in th
e 
Communication System section of the Game Day Admini
stration Report that is submitted to the Referee or 
a member of his crew no later than one hour and 30 minu
tes prior to kickoff. 
For additional requirements and policies pertaining to 
the system, including regulations for the storage of a
 
backup helmet for a non-quarterback who is used as a q
uarterback, or for the backup defensive player's 
helmet, please refer to the 
Policy Manual for Member Clubs/Game Operations.
 Penalty: If a player fails to notify the Referee of a c
hange in his status when required: Loss of five 
yards for illegal substitution.

specified in this Section 4. They must wear equipmen
t offering reasonable protection to themselves while 
reasonably avoiding risk of injury to other players. The
