Problem:
 Priority health-risk behaviors contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults. 
Population-based data on these behaviors at the national, state, and local levels can help monitor the effectiveness of public health 

interventions designed to protect and promote the health of youth nationwide.
Reporting Period Covered:
 September 2012ŒDecember 2013.

Description of the System:
 The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-risk 
behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 
3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections 

(STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In 

addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior 

Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and local 

education and health agencies. This report summarizes results for 104 health-risk behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma 

from the 2013 national survey, 42 state surveys, and 21 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9Œ12.
Results:
 Results from the 2013 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors 
associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10Œ24 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the 

survey, 41.4% of high school students nationwide among the 64.7% who drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the 

survey had texted or e-mailed while driving, 34.9% had drunk alcohol, and 23.4% had used marijuana. During the 12 months before 

the survey, 14.8% had been electronically bullied, 19.6% had been bullied on school property, and 8.0% had attempted suicide. 

Many high school students nationwide are engaged in sexual risk behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancies and STIs, 

including HIV infection. Nearly half (46.8%) of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 34.0% had had sexual intercourse during 

the 3 months before the survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 15.0% had had sexual intercourse with four or more persons 

during their life. Among currently sexually active students, 59.1% had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results 

from the 2013 national YRBS also indicate many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with chronic diseases, 

such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. During the 30 days before the survey, 15.7% of high school students had smoked 

cigarettes and 8.8% had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 5.0% of high school students had not eaten 

fruit or drunk 100% fruit juices and 6.6% had not eaten vegetables. More than one-third (41.3%) had played video or computer 

games or used a computer for something that was not school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day.
Interpretation:
 Many high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. 
The prevalence of most health-risk behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and across states and large urban school districts. 

Long term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most health-risk behaviors 

has decreased (e.g., physical fighting, current cigarette use, and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other health-risk behaviors 

has not changed (e.g., suicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, having ever used marijuana, and having drunk alcohol or used drugs 

before last sexual intercourse) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because of safety concern and obesity and overweight).
Public Health Action:
 YRBSS data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health-risk behaviors among subpopulations 
of students; assess trends in health-risk behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 20 national health objectives for 
Healthy People 2020
 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; 
and help develop and evaluate school and community policies, 

programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors 

and improve health outcomes among youth.

4Introduction
In the United States, 70% of all deaths among youth and 
young adults aged 10Œ24 years result from four causes: motor 
vehicle crashes (23%), other unintentional injuries (18%), 

homicide (15%), and suicide (15%) (
1). Among youth aged 
15Œ19 years, substantial morbidity and social problems also 

result from the estimated 329,772 births (
2); 548,032 cases of 
chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis (
3); and 2,240 cases of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (
4) reported annually. Among 
adults aged ˜25 years, 57% of all deaths in the United States 

result from cardiovascular disease (33%) and cancer (24%) (
1). 
These leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and 

adults in the United States are related to six categories of priority 

health-risk behaviors: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional 

injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 

4) sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and 

sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV infection; 

5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. These 

behaviors frequently are interrelated and are established during 

childhood and adolescence and extend into adulthood. To monitor 

priority health-risk behaviors in each of these six categories and 

obesity and asthma among youth and young adults, CDC 

developed the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) 

(5). YRBSS includes school-based national, state, and large urban 
school district Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) conducted 

among representative samples of students in grades 9Œ12. National, 

state, and large urban school district surveys have been conducted 

biennially since 1991 (Table 1). Additional 

information about the YRBSS is available at 

http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs
.This report summarizes results for 
104 health-risk behaviors plus obesity, 

overweight, and asthma from the 2013 

national YRBS and overall trends in 

health-risk behaviors during 1991Œ2013. 

Data from the 42 state and 21 large urban 

school district surveys with weighted data 

for the 2013 YRBSS cycle (Figure) also are 

included in this report. Data from five states 

and one large urban school district survey 

with unweighted data are not included. 

Among those with weighted data for 

2013, one state and two large urban school 

district surveys were conducted during fall 

2012; the national survey, 38 states, and 

18 large urban school district surveys were 

conducted during spring 2013; and three 

states and one large urban school district 

survey were conducted during fall 2013.
Methods
Detailed information about the methodology of the 
national, state, and large urban school district YRBSs has been 

described elsewhere (
5).Sampling
National Youth Risk Behavior Survey
The sampling frame for the 2013 national YRBS consisted 
of all regular public* and private
ƒ schools with students in at 
least one of grades 9Œ12 in the 50 states and the District of 

Columbia. The sampling frame was obtained from the Market 

Data Retrieval (MDR) database (
6). The MDR database 
includes information on both public and private schools and 

the most recent data from the Common Core of Data from 

the National Center for Education Statistics (
7). A three-stage 
cluster sample design produced a nationally representative 

sample of students in grades 9Œ12 who attend public and 

private schools. The first-stage sampling frame consisted of 

1,276 primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties, 

subareas of large counties, or groups of smaller, adjacent 

counties. The 1,276 PSUs were categorized into 16 strata 
* Might include charter schools and public alternative, special education, or 
vocational schools.
ƒ Might include religious and other private schools, but does not include private 
alternative, special education, or vocational schools.

4 3according to their metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status 
(i.e., urban city) and the percentages of black and Hispanic 

students in the PSUs. From the 1,276 PSUs, 54 were sampled 

with probability proportional to overall school enrollment size 

for the PSU.In the second stage of sampling, 193 schools with any of 
grades 9Œ12 were sampled with probability proportional to 

school enrollment size. The third stage of sampling consisted of 

random sampling in each of grades 9Œ12, one or two classrooms 

from either a required subject (e.g., English or social studies) or a 

required period (e.g., homeroom or second period). All students 

in sampled classes were eligible to participate. Schools, classes, 

and students that refused to participate were not replaced. 
To enable a separate analysis of data for black and Hispanic 
students, two classes per grade, rather than one, were sampled 

in schools with a high minority enrollment. In the past, three 

strategies were used to oversample black and Hispanic students: 

1) larger sampling rates were used to select PSUs that were in 

high-black and high-Hispanic strata; 2) a modified measure of 

size was used to increase the probability of sampling schools 

with a disproportionately high minority enrollment; and 3) two 

classes per grade, rather than one, were sampled in schools 

with a high minority enrollment. Because of increases in the 

proportions of black and Hispanic students in the population, 

only selection of two classes per grade was needed in 2013 to 

achieve adequate precision with minimum variance.
State and Large Urban School District Youth Risk 
Behaviors
In 2013, a two-stage cluster sample design was used to 
produce a representative sample of public
§ school students in grades 9Œ12 in 39 states and 21 large urban school districts and of public and private
¶ school students in grades 9Œ12 in three states (Ohio, South Dakota, and Vermont). In the first 

sampling stage, schools with any of grades 9Œ12 were sampled 

with probability proportional to school enrollment size in 

40 states and four large urban school districts; all schools with 

any of grades 9Œ12 were invited to participate in two states and 

17 large urban school districts. In the second sampling stage, 

intact classes from either a required subject (e.g., English or 

social studies) or a required period (e.g., homeroom or second 

period) were sampled randomly in 41 states and 20 large 

urban school districts, and all students in the sampled classes 
were eligible to participate. In one state and one large urban 

school district, all students in sampled schools were eligible 

to participate.
Data Collection Procedures 
and Questionnaires
Survey procedures for the national, state, and large urban 
school district surveys were designed to protect students™ privacy 

by allowing for anonymous and voluntary participation. Before 

survey administration, local parental permission procedures 

were followed. Students completed the self-administered 

questionnaire during one class period and recorded their 

responses directly on a computer-scannable booklet or answer 

sheet. CDC™s Institutional Review Board approved the protocol 

for the national YRBS.
The 2013 YRBS standard questionnaire contained 
86 questions. For the national questionnaire, the following 

six questions were added to the standard questionnaire:  ever 

use of hallucinogenic drugs, tested for HIV, participation in 

muscle strengthening activities, routine sunscreen use, indoor 

tanning device use, and number of hours of sleep on an average 

school night.  Because these questions are only on the national 

questionnaire, state and large urban school district data are not 

available for any variables based on these questions. In addition 

to four demographic questions and two questions assessing 
height and weight, the remaining questions on the standard 

questionnaire and the national questionnaire measured 

behaviors practiced or experienced by the student (referred to 

as ﬁbehaviorsﬂ). States and large urban school districts could 

add and/or delete questions from the standard questionnaire. 

Skip patterns, which occur when a particular response to one 

question indicates to the respondents that they should not 

answer one or more subsequent questions, were not included 

in any YRBS questionnaire to protect students™ privacy by 

ensuring all students took about the same amount of time to 
complete the questionnaire. For state and large urban school 

districts, only data from standard questions are presented in 

this report. Information about the reliability of the standard 

questionnaire has been published elsewhere (
8). The standard 
and national YRBS questionnaires are available at 
http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/questionnaire_rationale.htm
.Data Processing Procedures 
and Response Rates
For the 2013 national YRBS, 13,633 questionnaires were 
completed in 148 public and private schools. The national data 

set was cleaned and edited for inconsistencies. Missing data 

were not statistically imputed. Among the 13,633 completed 

questionnaires, 50 failed quality control** and were excluded 

from analysis, resulting in 13,583 usable questionnaires 
 ** A questionnaire that fails quality control has <20 r
emaining responses after 
editing or has the same answer to ˜15 consecutive questions.
§ Includes regular public schools and might include charter schools; public 
alternative, special education, or vocational schools; and schools overseen by 
the Bureau of Indian Education.
¶ Might include religious and other private schools.

4(Table 2). The school response rate was 77%, the student 
response rate was 88%, and the overall response rate was 

68%ƒƒ (Table 2).
Data from each state and large urban school district survey were 
cleaned and edited for inconsistencies with the same procedures 

used for the national data set. The percentage of completed 

questionnaires that failed quality control checks and were 

excluded from analysis ranged from .06% to 4.56% (median: 

0.56%) across the 42 states and from 0.07% to 4.55% (median: 

1.05%) across the 21 large urban school districts. The student 

sample sizes ranged from 1,107 to 53,785 (median: 1,987) across 

the states and from 1,102 to 10,778 (median: 1,581) across 

the large urban school districts (Table 2). Among the states, 

the school response rates ranged from 70% to 100%, student 

response rates ranged from 60% to 94%, and overall response 

rates ranged from 60% to 87%. Among the large urban school 

districts, the school response rates ranged from 89% to 100%, 

student response rates ranged from 69% to 90%, and overall 

response rates ranged from 68% to 90% (Table 2).
Race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: 1) ﬁAre you 
Hispanic or Latino?ﬂ (response options were ﬁyesﬂ or ﬁnoﬂ), and 

2) ﬁWhat is your race?ﬂ (response options were ﬁAmerican Indian 

or Alaska Native,ﬂ ﬁAsian,ﬂ ﬁblack or African American,ﬂ ﬁNative 

Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander,ﬂ or ﬁwhiteﬂ). For the second 

question, students could select more than one response option. 

For this report, students were classified as ﬁHispanic/ Latinoﬂ and 

are referred to as ﬁHispanicﬂ if they answered ﬁyesﬂ to the first 

question, regardless of how they answered the second question. 

Students who answered ﬁnoﬂ to the first question and selected 

only ﬁblack or African Americanﬂ to the second question were 

classified as ﬁblack or African Americanﬂ and are referred to as 

ﬁblack.ﬂ Students who answered ﬁnoﬂ to the first question and 

selected only ﬁwhiteﬂ to the second question were classified, 

and are referred to, as ﬁwhite.ﬂ Race/ethnicity was classified as 

missing for students who did not answer the first question and 

for students who answered ﬁnoﬂ to the first question but did not 

answer the second question.
Students were classified as obese or overweight based on 
their body mass index (kg/m2) (BMI), which was calculated from self-reported height and weight. The BMI values were 

compared with sex- and age-specific reference data from the 

2000 CDC growth charts (
9). Obese was defined as a BMI of 

˜95th percentile for age and sex. Overweight was defined as a 

BMI of ˜85th percentile and <95th percentile for age and sex. 

These classifications are not intended to diagnose obesity or 

overweight in individual students, but to provide population-

level estimates of obesity and overweight.
Weighting
For the national YRBS, a weight based on student sex, race/
ethnicity, and grade was applied to each record to adjust for 

school and student nonresponse and oversampling of black and 

Hispanic students. The overall weights were scaled so that the 

weighted count of students equals the total sample size, and 

the weighted proportions of students in each grade match the 

national population proportions. Therefore, weighted estimates 

are representative of all students in grades 9Œ12 attending 

public and private schools in the United States.
Data from states and large urban school districts that had a 
representative sample of students, appropriate documentation, 

and an overall response rate of ˜60% were weighted. A weight 

was applied to each record to adjust for school and student 

nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, 

and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction, such that the weighted 

count of students equals the student population in each 

jurisdiction. Data from 42 state and 21 large urban school 

districts were weighted. In 39 states and all large urban school 

districts, weighted estimates are representative of all students 

in grades 9Œ12 attending public schools in each jurisdiction. 

In three states (Ohio, South Dakota, and Vermont), weighted 

estimates are representative of all students in grades 9Œ12 

attending public and private schools in each jurisdiction.
Analytic Methods
Statistical analyses were conducted on weighted data using 
SAS (10) and SUDAAN (11) software to account for the 
complex sampling designs. Prevalence estimates and confidence 

intervals were computed for all variables and all data sets. In 

addition, for the national YRBS data, t tests were used to 

determine pairwise differences between subpopulations (
12). 
Differences between prevalence estimates were considered 

statistically significant if the t test p value was <0.05 for main 

effects (sex, race/ethnicity, and grade) and for interactions 

(sex by race/ethnicity, sex by grade, race/ethnicity by sex, and 

grade by sex). In the results section, only statistically significant 

differences in prevalence estimates are reported in the following 

order: sex, sex by race/ethnicity, sex by grade, race/ethnicity, 

race/ethnicity by sex, grade, and grade by sex.
To identify long-term temporal changes in health-risk 
behaviors nationwide, prevalence estimates from the earliest 

year of data collection to 2013 for each variable assessed with 

identically worded questions in three or more survey years were 

examined. Logistic regression analyses were used to account 

for all available estimates; control for sex, grade, and racial/ 

ethnic changes over time; and assess linear and quadratic time 

effects (12). Linear and quadratic time variables were treated 

as continuous and were coded using orthogonal coefficients

sampled schools) x (number of usable questionnaires/number of eligible

4 5calculated with PROC IML in SAS. Separate regression models 
were used to assess linear and quadratic time trends for every 

variable. When a significant quadratic trend was detected, 

Joinpoint software (
13) was used to automate identification 
of the year or ﬁjoinpointﬂ where the nonlinear (i.e., quadratic) 

trend changed and then regression models were used to assess 

linear trends occurring in each segment. Cubic and higher 

order time effects were not assessed. A quadratic time effect 

indicates a significant but nonlinear trend in prevalence over 

time. A temporal change that includes a significant linear and 

quadratic time effect demonstrates nonlinear variation (e.g., 

leveling off or change in direction) in addition to an overall 

increase or decrease over time. In addition, to identify 2-year 

temporal changes in health-risk behaviors nationwide, prevalence 

estimates from 2011 and 2013 were compared using t tests for 

each variable assessed with identically worded questions in both 

survey years. Prevalence estimates were considered statistically 

different if the t test p value was <0.05. 
In the results section, linear and quadratic trends are described 
followed by results from the t tests used to assess 2-year temporal 

changes. Information about long term trends and more recent 

changes are not available due to changes in question or response 

option wording or because the question was asked for the first 

time during 2013 for the following variables:  drove when 

drinking alcohol; texted or e-mailed while driving; physical 

dating violence; sexual dating violence; largest number of drinks 

in a row was 10 or more; IUD or implant use; and shot, patch, 

or birth control ring use. 
Results
Behaviors that Contribute to 
Unintentional Injuries
Never or Rarely Wore a Bicycle Helmet
Among the 67.0% of students nationwide who had ridden a bicycle during the 12 months before the survey, 87.9% had 

never or rarely worn a bicycle helmet (Table 3). The prevalence 

of having never or rarely worn a bicycle helmet was higher 

among male (88.6%) than female (87.0%) students and higher 

among black male (96.2%) and Hispanic male (93.7%) than 

black female (90.6%) and Hispanic female (90.9%) students, 

respectively. The prevalence of having never or rarely worn a 

bicycle helmet was higher among black (93.9%) and Hispanic 

(92.4%) than white (85.7%) students, higher among Hispanic 

female (90.9%) than white female (85.7%) students, higher 
among black male (96.2%) and Hispanic male (93.7%) than 

white male (85.8%) students, and higher among black male 
(96.2%) than Hispanic male (93.7%) students.
During 1991Œ2013, a significant linear decrease occurred 
overall in the prevalence of having never or rarely worn a bicycle 

helmet (96.2%Œ87.9%). A significant quadratic trend also was 

identified. The prevalence of having never or rarely worn a 

bicycle helmet decreased during 1991Œ2005 (96.2%Œ83.4%) 

and then increased during 2005Œ2013 (83.4%Œ87.9%). The 

prevalence of having never or rarely worn a bicycle helmet did 

not change significantly from 2011 (87.5%) to 2013 (87.9%).
 Across 31 states, the prevalence of having never or rarely worn 
a bicycle helmet ranged from 60.0% to 93.2% (median: 87.7%) 

(Table 4). Across 16 large urban school districts, the prevalence 

ranged from 75.1% to 93.6% (median: 88.2%). 
Never or Rarely Wore a Seat Belt
Nationwide, 7.6% of students never or rarely wore a seat 
belt when riding in a car driven by someone else (Table 3). 

The prevalence of having never or rarely worn a seat belt was 

higher among male (9.1%) than female (6.1%) students; higher 

among white male (8.5%) and black male (11.8%) than white 

female (4.7%) and black female (7.1%) students, respectively; 

and higher among 9th-grade male (9.8%), 10th-grade male 

(8.4%), 11th-grade male (9.7%), and 12th-grade male (8.3%) 

than 9th-grade female (7.1%), 10th-grade female (5.7%), 

11th-grade female (6.3%), and 12th-grade female (5.1%) 

students, respectively. The prevalence of having never or rarely 

worn a seat belt was higher among black (9.5%) and Hispanic 

(8.8%) than white (6.6%) students, higher among black female 

(7.1%) and Hispanic female (8.7%) than white female (4.7%) 

students, and higher among black male (11.8%) than white 
male (8.5%) students.During 1991Œ2013, a significant linear decrease occurred 
overall in the prevalence of having never or rarely worn a seat 

belt (25.9%Œ7.6%). A significant quadratic trend was not 

identified. The prevalence of having never or rarely worn a 

seat belt did not change significantly from 2011 (7.7%) to 

2013 (7.6%). Across 40 states, the prevalence of having never or rarely 
worn a seat belt ranged from 5.6% to 16.1% (median: 8.7%) 

(Table 4). Across 19 large urban school districts, the prevalence 

ranged from 4.7% to 25.0% (median: 10.3%).
Rode with a Driver Who Had Been 
Drinking Alcohol
During the 30 days before the survey, 21.9% of students 
nationwide had ridden one or more times in a car or other 
vehicle driven by someone who had been drinking alcohol 

(Table 5). The prevalence of having ridden with a driver who 

had been drinking alcohol was higher among black female 

(24.8%) than black male (18.9%) students. The prevalence of 

having ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol was

4higher among Hispanic (29.1%) than white (19.7%) and black 
(21.9%) students, higher among Hispanic female (29.2%) 

than white female (19.9%) and black female (24.8%) students, 

higher among black female (24.8%) than white female 

(19.9%) students, and higher among Hispanic male (28.9%) 

than white male (19.6%) and black male (18.9%) students. 
The prevalence of having ridden with a driver who had been 

drinking alcohol was higher among 12th-grade (24.2%) than 

9th-grade (19.4%) students, higher among 11th-grade male 
(23.4%) and 12th-grade male (25.3%) than 9th-grade male 

(18.1%) students, and higher among 12th grade male (25.3%) 

than 10th grade male (19.9%) students.During 1991Œ2013, a significant linear decrease occurred 
overall in the prevalence of having ridden with a driver who 

had been drinking alcohol (39.9%Œ21.9%). A significant 

quadratic trend was not identified. The prevalence of having 

ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol did not 

change significantly from 2011 (24.1%) to 2013 (21.9%). 
Across 38 states, the prevalence of having ridden with a 
driver who had been drinking alcohol ranged from 12.4% 

to 29.6% (median: 20.5%) (Table 6). Across 20 large urban 

school districts, the prevalence ranged from 15.2% to 32.0% 

(median: 23.6%).Drove When Drinking Alcohol
Among the 64.3% of students nationwide who drove a car 
or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey,
§§ 10.0% had driven a car or other vehicle one or more times when they 

had been drinking alcohol during the 30 days before the survey 

(Table 5). The prevalence of having driven a car or other vehicle 

when they had been drinking alcohol was higher among male 
(12.0%) than female (7.8%) students; higher among white 
male (12.4%) and Hispanic male (14.5%) than white female 

(8.2%) and Hispanic female (8.4%) students, respectively; and 

higher among 11th-grade male (14.0%) and 12th grade male 
(15.7%) than 11th-grade female (8.0%) and 12th-grade female 

(10.5%) students, respectively. The prevalence of having driven 

a car or other vehicle when they had been drinking alcohol 

was higher among white (10.4%) and Hispanic (11.6%) than

Nationwide, 15.2% of students had not participated in at 
least 60 minutes of any kind of physical activity that increased 
their heart rate and made them breathe hard some of the 

time on at least 1 day during the 7 days before the survey 

(i.e., did not participate in at least 60 minutes of physical 

activity on at least 1 day) (Table 95). The prevalence of not 

having participated in at least 60 minutes of physical activity

Because of changes in question context starting in 2011, 
national YRBS prevalence estimates derived from the 

60 minutes of physical activity question in 2011 and 2013 are 

not comparable to those reported in 2009 or earlier. On the 

2005Œ2009 national YRBS questionnaire, physical activity 

was assessed with three questions (in the following order) that 

asked the number of days students participated in 1) at least 

20 minutes of vigorous physical activity; 2) at least 30 minutes 

of moderate physical activity; and 3) at least 60 minutes of 

aerobic (moderate and vigorous) physical activity. On the 2011 

and 2013 national YRBS questionnaire, only the 60 minutes of 

aerobic physical activity question was included. Consequently,

United States monitoring a broad range of health-risk behaviors 

among high school students. YRBSS data are used widely 

to compare the prevalence of health-risk behaviors among 

subpopulations of students; assess trends in health-risk behaviors 

over time; monitor progress toward achieving national health 

objectives; provide comparable state and large urban school 

district data; and help develop, assess, and improve school and 

community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease 

health-risk behaviors and improve health outcomes among youth. 

Because of its broad scope, YRBSS also allows analysis of the 

inter-relationships among health-risk behaviors (e.g., how alcohol 

and other drug use is associated with behaviors that contribute 

to violence) and a more complete understanding of how health-

risk behaviors cluster among various subpopulations of students 

(e.g., whether tobacco use or sexual behaviors are more likely 

to occur among males than females or in certain regions of the 

country). Although these analyses are beyond the scope of this 

report, they are a particular strength of YRBSS as compared with 

more narrowly focused surveys.
Compare Health-Risk Behavior Prevalence 
Among Subpopulations of Students
YRBSS is designed to identify how health-risk behaviors 
vary by subpopulations of high school students defined by 
 MMWR / June 13, 2014
 / Vol. 
63 / No. 
4 43sex and race/ethnicity. Understanding of these variations (or 
lack of variation) in health-risk behaviors might help design, 

target, and identify the impact of school and community 

policies, programs, and practices. However, YRBSS data cannot 

isolate the effects of sex and race/ethnicity from the effects 

of socioeconomic status (SES) or culture on the prevalence 

of health risk behaviors. In a national study, the likelihood 

of behavioral cardiovascular disease risks, including obesity, 

sedentary behaviors, and tobacco exposure, increased among 

adolescents aged 12Œ17 years as the SES based on poverty-

income ratio decreased (
14).Variations by Sex
On the basis of the 2013 national YRBS data, prevalence 
estimates for many health-risk behaviors are different between 

male and female students. For example, male students were 

more likely than female students to report three of the five 

health-risk behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries 
(never or rarely wearing a bicycle helmet, never or rarely 

wearing a seat belt, and driving when drinking alcohol). 

However, male and female students were equally likely to report 

two health-risk behaviors that contribute to unintentional 

injuries (riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol 

and texting or e-mailing while driving).Male students also were more likely than female students 
to report seven violence-related behaviors (carrying a weapon, 

carrying a gun, carrying a weapon on school property, being 

threatened or injured with a weapon on school property, 

being in a physical fight, being injured in a physical fight, 

and being in a physical fight on school property). However, 

female students were more likely than male students to 

report not going to school because of safety concerns, being 

electronically bullied, being bullied on school property, being 

forced to have sexual intercourse, experiencing physical dating 

violence, and experiencing sexual dating violence. Female 

students also were more likely than male students to report 

all five suicide-related behaviors (feeling sad or hopeless, 

seriously considering attempting suicide, making a suicide 

plan, attempting suicide, and making a suicide attempt that 
resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to be 

treated by a doctor or nurse).
Male students were more likely than female students to report 
seven of the 13 tobacco use behaviors (ever smoking cigarettes, 

smoking a whole cigarette before age 13 years, smoking more 

than 10 cigarettes per day, buying cigarettes in a store or gas 

station, current smokeless tobacco use, current cigar use, and 

current tobacco use). Trying to quit smoking cigarettes was the 

only tobacco use behavior more likely to be reported by female 

students than male students. However, five tobacco use behaviors 

did not vary by sex (current cigarette use, current frequent 
cigarette use, smoking cigarettes on school property, ever smoking 

cigarettes daily, and currently smoking cigarettes daily).
Male students were more likely than female students to 
report 12 of the 19 alcohol and other drug use behaviors 

(drinking alcohol before age 13 years; having 10 or more as 

the largest number of drinks in a row; ever using marijuana; 

trying marijuana before age 13 years; current marijuana use; 

ever using cocaine; ever using hallucinogenic drugs; ever 

using ecstasy; ever using heroin; ever taking steroids without a 

doctor™s prescription; ever injecting any illegal drug; and being 

offered, sold, or given an illegal drug on school property). In 

contrast, female students were more likely than male students 

to report only three of the 19 alcohol and other drug use 

behaviors (ever drinking alcohol, drinking alcohol before age 

13 years, and ever using inhalants).
Male students were more likely than female students to 
report three sexual behaviors that increase risk for unintended 

pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including 

HIV infection (having sexual intercourse before age 13 years, 

having sexual intercourse with four or more persons during 

their life, and drinking alcohol or using drugs before last 

sexual intercourse). Male students were more likely than 

female students to report one behavior (using a condom) that 

reduces risk for unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted 

infections, including HIV infection. However, female students 

were more likely than male students to report five other 

behaviors that reduce risk (using birth control pills; using a 

shot, patch, or birth control ring; using birth control pills, an 

IUD or implant, or a shot, patch, or birth control ring; using 

a condom and birth control pills, an IUD or implant, or a 

shot, patch, or birth control ring; and being tested for HIV) 

and one behavior that increases risk (not using any method 

to prevent pregnancy).
Male students were more likely than female students to 
report 14 of 18 dietary behaviors (eating fruit or drinking 

100% fruit juices zero, one or more, two or more, and three 

or more times per day; eating vegetables zero, two or more, 

and three or more times per day; drinking one or more, two 

or more, and three or more glasses per day of milk; drinking 

soda or pop one or more, two or more, and three or more times 

per day; and eating breakfast on all 7 days before the survey). 

Female students were more likely than male students to report 

two dietary behaviors (not drinking milk and not drinking 

soda or pop during the 7 days before the survey).
Male students were more likely than female students to 
report six behaviors that increase overall physical activity (being 

physically active at least 60 minutes per day on 5 or more days, 

being physically active at least 60 minutes per day on all 7 days, 

participating in muscle strengthening activities on 3 or more 

days; attending physical education classes, attending physical  44 MMWR / June 13, 
2014 / Vol. 
63 / No. 
4education classes daily, and playing on at least one sports 
team). However, female students were more likely than male 

students to not participate in at least 60 minutes of physical 

activity on any day. Playing video or computer games or using 

computers and watching television 3 or more hours per day 

did not vary by sex.
Although male students were more likely than female 
students to be obese, female students were more likely than 

male students to report all three unsafe weight loss behaviors 

(not eating for ˜24 hours to lose weight or to keep from gaining 

weight; taking diet pills, powders, or liquids to lose weight or 

to keep from gaining weight; and vomiting or taking laxatives 

to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight).
Variations by Race/Ethnicity
On the basis of the 2013 national YRBS data, prevalence 
estimates for many health-risk behaviors vary by race/ethnicity.
 White students were more likely than black and Hispanic 

students to report 23 behaviors, black students were more 

likely than white and Hispanic students to report 14 behaviors, 

and Hispanic students were more likely than white and black 

students to report 19 behaviors. Fourteen behaviors did not 

vary by race/ethnicity.
More specifically, white students were more likely than black 
and Hispanic students to report one behavior that contributes 

to unintentional injuries (texting or emailing while driving); 

three violence-related behaviors (carrying a weapon, being 

electronically bullied, and being bullied on school property); 

eight tobacco use behaviors (current cigarette use, current 

frequent cigarette use, smoking more than 10 cigarettes per 

day, smoking cigarettes on school property, ever smoking 

cigarettes daily, currently smoking cigarettes daily, current 

smokeless tobacco use, and current tobacco use); three sexual 

behaviors (using birth control pills; using birth control pills, 

an IUD or implant, or a shot, patch, or birth control ring; and 

using a condom and birth control pills, an IUD or implant, 

or a shot, patch, or birth control ring); five dietary behaviors 

(eating vegetables one or more times per day; drinking one or 

more, two or more, and three or more glasses per day of milk; 

and eating breakfast all 7 days); one physical activity behavior 

(being physically active at least 60 minutes per day on 5 or 

more days); and two other behaviors (using sunscreen routinely 

and using indoor tanning devices).Black students were more likely than white and Hispanic 
students to report two violence-related behaviors (being in a 

physical fight and being in a physical fight on school property); 

one tobacco use behavior (trying to quit smoking cigarettes); 

six sexual behaviors (ever having sexual intercourse, having 

sexual intercourse before age 13 years, having sexual intercourse 

with four or more persons during their life, current sexual 
activity, using a condom, and being tested for HIV); three 

dietary behaviors (not eating fruit or drinking 100% fruit 

juices, not drinking milk, and drinking soda or pop three or 

more times per day); and one physical activity behavior (not 

participating in at least 60 minutes of physical activity on any 

day) and ever having asthma.
Hispanic students were more likely than white and 
black students to report one behavior that contributes to 

unintentional injuries (riding with a driver who had been 

drinking alcohol); all five suicide-related behaviors (feeling sad 

or hopeless; seriously considering attempting suicide; making a 

suicide plan; attempting suicide; and making a suicide attempt 

that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to 

be treated by a doctor or nurse); eight alcohol and other drug 

use behaviors (ever drinking alcohol; ever using cocaine; ever 

using inhalants; ever using ecstasy; ever using heroin; ever using 

methamphetamines; ever taking steroids without a doctor™s 

prescription; and being offered, sold, or given an illegal drug 

on school property); one physical activity behavior (attending 

physical education classes); and four weight control behaviors 

(trying to lose weight, not eating for ˜24 hours to lose weight 

or to keep from gaining weight; taking diet pills, powders, or 

liquids to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight; and 

vomiting or taking laxatives to lose weight or to keep from 

gaining weight).
White, black, and Hispanic students were equally likely 
to report three violence-related behaviors (carrying a gun, 

experiencing physical dating violence, and experiencing sexual 

dating violence); two tobacco use behaviors (buying cigarettes 

in a store or gas station and current cigar use); one alcohol and 

other drug use behavior (ever injecting any illegal drug); three 

sexual behaviors (using an IUD or implant; using a shot, patch, 

or birth control ring; and drinking alcohol or using drugs 

before last sexual intercourse); two dietary behaviors (eating 

vegetables two or more time per day and not drinking soda 

or pop); and two physical activity variables (being physically 

active at least 60 minutes per day on all 7 days and playing on 

at least one sports team) and being obese.
Assess Trends in Health-Risk Behaviors 
Over Time
YRBSS data can be used to assess long term trends and 
more recent changes in health-risk behaviors. This report 

identifies many linear increases and decreases that reflect long 

term reductions in risk behaviors and potential improvements 

in health outcomes. Quadratic trends might reflect more 

recent changes.
More specifically, linear decreases occurred for all three 
behaviors (for which trend data were available) that contribute 
 MMWR / June 13, 2014
 / Vol. 
63 / No. 
4 45to unintentional injuries (never or rarely wearing a bicycle 
helmet, never or rarely wearing a seat belt, and riding with a 

driver who had been drinking alcohol). Linear decreases also 

occurred for seven of the 11 violence-related behaviors (for 

which trend data were available) (carrying a weapon, carrying a 

gun, carrying a weapon on school property, being threatened or 

injured with a weapon on school property, being in a physical 

fight, being injured in a physical fight, and being in a physical 

fight on school property) and three of the five behaviors related 

to suicide (seriously considering attempting suicide, making 

a suicide plan, and attempting suicide) and a linear increase 

occurred for one violence-related behavior (not going to school 

because of safety concerns). Unfortunately, quadratic trends 

indicate that weapon carrying and gun carrying leveled off 

more recently and never or rarely wearing a bicycle helmet, 

seriously considering attempting suicide, and making a suicide 

plan increased more recently.
Linear decreases occurred for 11 of the 13 tobacco use 
behaviors (ever smoking cigarettes, smoking a whole cigarette 

before age 13 years, current cigarette use, current frequent 

cigarette use, smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day, smoking 

cigarettes on school property, buying cigarettes in a store or 

gas station, ever smoking cigarettes daily, currently smoking 

cigarettes daily, current cigar use, and current tobacco use). 

Quadratic trends indicated that eight of these behaviors 

(ever smoking cigarettes, smoking a whole cigarette before 

age 13 years, current cigarette use, current frequent cigarette 

use, smoking cigarettes on school property, currently smoking 

cigarettes daily, current cigar use, and current tobacco use) also 

decreased more recently.
Linear decreases occurred for four of the five alcohol use 
behaviors (for which trend data were available) (ever drinking 

alcohol, drinking alcohol before age 13 years, current alcohol 

use, and drinking five or more drinks of alcohol in a row) 

and quadratic trends indicated more recent decreases as well 

in these same behaviors. Linear decreases occurred for five of 

the 13 other drug use behaviors (ever using hallucinogenic 

drugs; ever using inhalants; ever using ecstasy; ever using 

methamphetamines; and ever using prescription drugs without 

a doctor™s prescription and being offered, sold, or given an 

illegal drug on school property), but quadratic trends for two 

of these behaviors (ever using hallucinogenic drugs and ever 

using ecstasy) indicated they had leveled off more recently. 

In addition, although a linear increase occurred for current 

marijuana use and ever taking steroids without a doctor™s 

prescription, quadratic trends indicated that since 1995 

current marijuana use and since 2001 ever taking steroids 

both decreased.
Across the 12 sexual behaviors (for which trend data were 
available), linear decreases occurred for five risk behaviors (ever 
having sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse before age 

13 years, having sexual intercourse with four or more persons 

during their life, being currently sexually active, and not using 

any method to prevent pregnancy), while a linear increase 

occurred for condom use. However, quadratic trends indicated 

no change more recently for two of the risk behaviors (ever 

having sexual intercourse and having sexual intercourse with four 

or more persons during their life) and a decrease in condom use.
Linear decreases that occurred for four dietary behaviors 
(not eating fruit or drink 100% fruit juices and drinking soda 

or pop one or more, two or more, and three or more times 

per day) and linear increases that occurred for two other dietary 

behaviors (eating vegetables three or more times per day and 

not drinking or soda or pop) are positive changes. However, 

linear increases for two dietary behaviors (not eating vegetables 

and not drinking milk) and linear decreases for drinking one or 

more, two or more, and three or more glasses of milk per day 

are negative changes. Similarly, although a decrease occurred 

for participating in muscle strengthening activities and a linear 

increase occurred for using computers 3 or more times per day, 

a linear decrease occurred for watching television 3 or more 

hours per day. The negative changes in dietary behaviors and 

physical activity might have contributed to linear increases 

in obesity and overweight. Linear decreases occurred for two 

unhealthy weight loss behaviors (taking diet pills, powders, 

or liquids to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight and 

vomiting or taking laxatives to lose weight or to keep from 

gaining weight).
Monitor Progress Toward Achieving 
National Health Objectives
The national YRBS is the primary source of data to measure 
20 Healthy People 2020
 objectives, including one leading health 
indicator (15). The Healthy People 2020
 objectives provide a 
comprehensive agenda for improving the health of all persons 

in the United States during 2011-2020. This report provides 

the Healthy People 2020
 targets and data from the 2013 
national YRBS for 20 objectives (Table 117). The data indicates 

that, as of 2013, four of the 20 Healthy People 2020
 objectives 
have been achieved. 
Healthy People 2020
 objective C-20.3 is 
to reduce the proportion of adolescents in grades 9Œ12 who 

report using artificial sources of ultraviolet light for tanning 

to ˚14.0%. During 2013, 12.8% of high school students 

nationwide had used an indoor tanning device (e.g., sunlamp, 

sunbed, or tanning booth) one or more times during the 

12 months before the survey. 
Healthy People 2020 
objective 
IVP-34 is to reduce physical fighting among adolescents to 

˚28.4%. In 2013, 24.7% of high school students nationwide 

had been in a physical fight one or more times during the 
 46 MMWR / June 13, 
2014 / Vol. 
63 / No. 
412 months before the survey. 
Healthy People 2020
 objective 
SA-1 is to reduce the proportion of adolescents who report that 
they rode, during the previous 30 days, with a driver who had 

been drinking alcohol to ˚25.5%. During 2013, 21.9% of high 

school students nationwide had rode in a car or other vehicle 

driven by someone who had been drinking alcohol one or more 

times during the 30 days before the survey. 
Healthy People 2020
 objective TU-2.2 is to reduce the proportion of adolescents 

who use cigarettes during the past 30 days to ˚16.0%. During 

2013, 15.7% of high school students smoked cigarettes on at 

least one day during the 30 days before the survey. Although 

the table indicates that Healthy People 2020 
objective PA-3.1 
to increase the proportion of adolescents who meet current 

federal physical activity guidelines for aerobic activity has 

been met, the 2013 YRBS prevalence estimate for aerobic 

physical activity is not comparable to the baseline prevalence 

estimate upon which the target was set because of a change 
in the context of the question starting with the 2011 national 

YRBS questionnaire.
To obtain additional 
Healthy People 2020
 objectives, positive 
changes in school and community policies, programs, and 

practices might be needed. For example, 
Healthy People 2020
 objective PA-5 is to increase the proportion of adolescents 

who participate in daily school physical education to ˜36.6%. 

During 2013, only 29.4% of high school students nationwide 

met this objective. Similarly, 
Healthy People 2020
 objective 
PA-8.3.3 is to increase the proportion of adolescents in 

grades 9Œ12 who use a computer or play computer games 

outside of school (for non-school work) for no more than 

2 hours a day to ˜82.6%. During 2013, only 58.7% of high 

school students nationwide met this objective.
Provide Comparable State and Large 
Urban School District Data
One of the strengths of YRBSS is that it provides not just 
national, but state and large urban school district data. These 

data are more likely to be used to develop, improve, and evaluate 

state and local policies, programs, and practices because they 

reflect a more relevant population. It is also possible to compare 

data from the state and large urban school district surveys 

because they share similar sample designs, questionnaires, data 

collection procedures, and data processing procedures.
Across states, a range of 25 or more percentage points or a 
fivefold variation or greater was identified for the following 

25 health-risk behaviors:never or rarely wore a bicycle helmet (minimum: 60.0%; 

maximum: 93.2%);drove when drinking alcohol (minimum: 2.5%; 

maximum: 12.6%);texted or e-mailed while driving (minimum: 32.3%; 

maximum: 61.3%);ever smoked cigarettes (minimum: 18.3%; 

maximum: 52.1%);current frequent cigarette use (minimum: 1.3%; 

maximum: 8.9%);smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day (minimum: 2.4%; 

maximum: 15.7%);bought cigarettes in a store or gas station (minimum: 4.5%; 

maximum: 28.7%);ever smoked cigarettes daily (minimum: 2.6%; 

maximum: 13.9%);currently smoked cigarettes daily (minimum: 0.9%; 

maximum: 6.7%);current smokeless tobacco use (minimum: 2.6%; 

maximum: 15.9%);current tobacco use (minimum: 5.6%; maximum: 29.7%);
ever drank alcohol (minimum: 30.7%; maximum: 70.5%);
current alcohol use (minimum: 11.0%; maximum: 39.3%);
largest number of drinks in a row was 10 or more 

(minimum: 1.2%; maximum: 9.0%);ever used marijuana (minimum: 16.8%; maximum: 43.3%);
ever used heroin (minimum: 1.1%; maximum: 7.8%);
ever used methamphetamines (minimum: 1.6%; 

maximum: 8.9%);ever took steroids without a doctor™s prescription 

(minimum: 1.5%; maximum: 8.8%);IUD or implant use (minimum: 0.3%; maximum: 5.0%);shot, patch, or birth control ring use (minimum: 1.3%; 

maximum: 9.5%);drank one or more glasses per day of milk (minimum: 

26.0%; maximum: 56.4%);drank two or more glasses per day of milk (minimum: 14.0%; 

maximum: 42.4%);drank soda or pop one or more times per day (minimum: 12.2%; 

maximum: 38.0%);attended physical education classes (minimum: 30.7%; 
maximum: 92.7%); andattended physical education classes daily (minimum: 4.5%; 

maximum: 63.6%).Across large urban school districts, a range of 25 or more 
percentage points or a fivefold variation or greater was 

identified for the following 14 health-risk behaviors:
never or rarely wore a seat belt (minimum: 4.7%; 

maximum: 25.0%);currently smoked cigarettes daily (minimum: 0.4%; 

maximum: 2.5%);ever use marijuana (minimum: 28.2%; maximum: 54.4%);
ever had sexual intercourse (minimum: 25.8%; 

maximum: 59.7%); MMWR / June 13, 2014

control ring use (minimum: 10.2%; maximum: 41.4%);
condom use and birth control pill; IUD or implant; or

(minimum: 19.3%; maximum: 47.5%);attended physical education classes (minimum: 28.4%; 
maximum: 85.0%); andattended physical education classes daily (minimum: 7.8%; 

maximum: 40.9%).Across the states, 32% (n = eight) of the health-risk behaviors 
with a range of 25 or more percentage points or a fivefold 

variation or greater were related to tobacco use and an additional 

28% (n = seven) were related to alcohol and other drug use. 

Across the large urban school districts, 43% (n = six) of the 

health-risk behaviors with a range of 25 or more percentage 

points or a fivefold variation or greater were related to dietary 

behaviors and physical activity and an additional 36% (n = five) 

were related to sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended 

pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. All of these 

variations reflect differences in state and local laws and policies, 

enforcement practices, access to drugs, availability of effective 

school and community interventions, prevailing behavioral and 

social norms, demographic characteristics of the population, 

and adult practices and health-risk behaviors and also highlight 

how changes in one or more of these factors might contribute to 

reductions in health-risk behaviors among high school students.
Develop, Assess, and Improve Health-
Related Policies, Programs, and Practices
CDC and other federal agencies use national YRBS data to 
assess the contributions of HIV and other STD prevention 

and chronic disease prevention efforts designed to reduce 

health-risk behaviors among youth and, in a variety of reports 

and publications, to stimulate support for and improvements 

in public health interventions. At the state and local level, 

agencies and nongovernmental organizations use YRBS data in 

a variety of ways to improve health-related policies, programs, 

and practices. For example, the San Diego Unified School 

District used YRBS data to identify symptoms of an unhealthy 
school environment, including feeling unsafe at school or on the 

way to or from school, feeling sad or hopeless, considering or 

planning suicide, or having attempted suicide among all students 

including sexual minority students. This spurred development 

of a district-wide Bullying, Harassment, and Intimidation 

Prohibition Policy that complies with federal and state laws 

and extensively delineates the types of protections addressed. 

In Kentucky, after reviewing YRBS data on fruit and vegetable 

consumption, physical activity, and obesity, the Coordinated 

School Health Program and Kentucky Action for Healthy 

Kids collaborated to create Students Taking Charge projects in 

high schools around the state. This initiative trains high school 

students to assess their school™s nutritional and physical activity 

environment, develop an action plan to improve it, implement 

their plan using minigrants, and learn how to advocate for 

healthier school environments and policies. In Philadelphia, 

YRBS data on sexual behaviors were cited along with data on 

the prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea to help persuade the 

Philadelphia Department of Health and the School District of 

Philadelphia to set up an in-school STD screening program to 

educate students about STDs and identify and treat chlamydia 

and gonorrhea among high school students.Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, these data apply only to youth who attend 

school and, therefore, are not representative of all persons in this 

age group. Nationwide, in 2009, of persons aged 16Œ17 years, 

approximately 4% were not enrolled in a high school program 

and had not completed high school (16). Second, the extent 
of underreporting or overreporting of behaviors cannot be 

determined, although the survey questions demonstrate good 

test-retest reliability (
8). Third, BMI is calculated on the basis 

of self-reported height and weight, and, therefore, tends to 

underestimate the prevalence of obesity and overweight (
17). 
Fourth, not all states and large urban school districts include 

all of the standard questions on their YRBS questionnaire. For 

example, four states (Georgia, Louisiana, Utah, and Virginia) 

do not ask any questions on sexual risk behaviors.Conclusions
YRBSS is an ongoing source of high-quality data at the 
national, state, and large urban school district levels for 

monitoring health-risk behaviors that contribute to the leading 

causes of mortality and morbidity among youth and adults in 

the United States. In 2013, in addition to the national data, 

42 states and 21 large urban school districts obtained data  48 MMWR / June 13, 
2014 / Vol. 
63 / No. 
4representative of high school students in their jurisdiction. 
These data have been an important tool for planning, 

implementing, and evaluating public health policies, programs, 

and practices in schools and communities. Ongoing support 

for YRBSS, enhanced training and technical assistance for 

participating state and local health and education agencies, 

an increase in the number of states with representative data, 

more substate surveys at the large urban school district and 

county- or school-district level, and more universal use of all 

standard questions on YRBSS will help sustain the surveillance 

system and the quality of the data it produces and ensure that 

it continues to inform future efforts designed to protect and 

promote the health of youth nationwide.

NOTE:
 Because of changes in question context starting in 2011, national YRBS prevalence estimates derived from the 60 minutes of physical activity question in 2011 
and 2013 are not comparable to those reported in 2009 or earlier. On the 2005Œ2009 national YRBS questionnaire, physical activity was assessed with three questions 

(in the following order) that asked the number of days students participated in 1) at least 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity; 2) at least 30 minutes of moderate 

physical activity; and 3) at least 60 minutes of aerobic (moderate and vigorous) physical activity. On the 2011 and 2013 national YRBS questionnaire, only the 60 minutes 

of aerobic physical activity question was included.

NOTE:
 Because of changes in question context starting in 2011, national YRBS prevalence estimates derived from the 60 minutes of physical activity question in 2011 
and 2013 are not comparable to those reported in 2009 or earlier. On the 2005Œ2009 national YRBS questionnaire, physical activity was assessed with three questions 

(in the following order) that asked the number of days students participated in 1) at least 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity; 2) at least 30 minutes of moderate 

physical activity; and 3) at least 60 minutes of aerobic (moderate and vigorous) physical activity. On the 2011 and 2013 national YRBS questionnaire, only the 60 

minutes of aerobic physical activity question was included.

ƒ The target setting method for this objective was a 10% improvement from the baseline; the baseline source was the 2009 national YRBS. However, because of 

changes in question context starting in 2011, national YRBS prevalence estimates derived from the 60 minutes of physical activity question in 2011 and 2013 are 

not comparable to those reported in 2009 or earlier. On the 2005Œ2009 national YRBS questionnaire, physical activity was assessed with three questions (in the 

following order) that asked the number of days students participated in 1) at least 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity; 2) at least 30 minutes of moderate physical 

activity; and 3) at least 60 minutes of aerobic (moderate and vigorous) physical activity. On the 2011 and 2013 national YRBS questionnaire, only the 60 minutes of 

aerobic physical activity question was included.
