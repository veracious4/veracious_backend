FQHCs can serve as telehealth services originating sites if they are in a qualifying area. An originating 

site is where an eligible Medicare patient is during the telehealth service. FQHCs that serve as 
originating sites for telehealth services get an originating site facility fee. Although FQHC services 

are not subject to deductible, you must apply the deductible when an FQHC bills for the telehealth 
originating site facility fee. This fee is not considered an FQHC service.
