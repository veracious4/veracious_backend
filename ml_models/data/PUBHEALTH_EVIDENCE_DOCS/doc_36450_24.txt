 Cough, coryza, and diarrhea are more common with viral pharyngitis.
 Available diagnostic tests include throat culture and rapid antigen detection testing.
 Throat culture is considered the diagnostic standard, although the sensitivity and specificity of rapid antigen detection testing have improved significantly.
 The modified Centor score can be used to help physicians decide which patients need no testing, throat culture/rapid antigen detection testing, or empiric antibiotic therapy.
 Penicillin (10 days of oral therapy or one injection of intramuscular benzathine penicillin) is the treatment of choice because of cost, narrow spectrum of activity, and effectiveness.
 Amoxicillin is equally effective and more palatable.
 Erythromycin and first-generation cephalosporins are options in patients with penicillin allergy.
 Increased group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) treatment failure with penicillin has been reported.
 Although current guidelines recommend first-generation cephalosporins for persons with penicillin allergy, some advocate the use of cephalosporins in all nonallergic patients because of better GABHS eradication and effectiveness against chronic GABHS carriage.
 Chronic GABHS colonization is common despite appropriate use of antibiotic therapy.
 Chronic carriers are at low risk of transmitting disease or developing invasive GABHS infections, and there is generally no need to treat carriers.
 Whether tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy decreases the incidence of GABHS pharyngitis is poorly understood.
 At this time, the benefits are too small to outweigh the associated costs and surgical risks.
 Pharyngitis is diagnosed in 11 million patients in U.S. emergency departments and ambulatory settings annually.1 Most episodes are viral.
 Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), the most common bacterial etiology, accounts for 15 to 30 percent of cases of acute pharyngitis in children and 5 to 20 percent in adults.2 Among school-aged children, the incidences of acute sore throat, swab-positive GABHS, and serologically confirmed GABHS infection are 33, 13, and eight per 100 child-years, respectively.3 Thus, about one in four children with acute sore throat has serologically confirmed GABHS pharyngitis.
 Forty-three percent of families with an index case of GABHS pharyngitis have a secondary case.3 Late winter and early spring are peak GABHS seasons.

 In patients with acute febrile respiratory illness, physicians accurately differentiate bacterial from viral infections using only the history and physical findings about one half of the time.4 No single element of the patient’s history or physical examination reliably confirms or excludes GABHS pharyngitis.5 Sore throat, fever with sudden onset (temperature greater than 100.4° F [38° C]), and exposure to Streptococcus within the preceding two weeks suggest GABHS infection.
 Cervical node lymphadenopathy and pharyngeal or tonsillar inflammation or exudates are common signs.
 Palatal petechiae and scarlatiniform rash are highly specific but uncommon; a swollen uvula is sometimes noted.
 Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea are more common with viral pharyngitis.

 2000;284(22):2915.CLINICAL DECISION RULESThe original Centor score uses four signs and symptoms to estimate the probability of acute streptococcal pharyngitis in adults with a sore throat.6 The score was later modified by adding age and validated in 600 adults and children.7,8 The cumulative score determines the likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis and the need for antibiotics (Figure 19).
 Patients with a score of zero or 1 are at very low risk for streptococcal pharyngitis and do not require testing (i.e., throat culture or rapid antigen detection testing [RADT]) or antibiotic therapy.
 Patients with a score of 2 or 3 should be tested using RADT or throat culture; positive results warrant antibiotic therapy.
 Patients with a score of 4 or higher are at high risk of streptococcal pharyngitis, and empiric treatment may be considered.View/Print FigureClinical Decision Rule for Management of Sore ThroatFigure 1.Modified Centor score and management options using clinical decision rule.

 1998;158(1):79.LABORATORY DIAGNOSISWith correct sampling and plating techniques, a single-swab throat culture is 90 to 95 percent sensitive.10 RADT allows for earlier treatment, symptom improvement, and reduced disease spread.
 RADT specificity ranges from 90 to 99 percent.
 Sensitivity depends on the commercial RADT kit used and was approximately 70 percent with older latex agglutination assays.11,12 Newer enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, optical immunoassays, and chemiluminescent DNA probes are 90 to 99 percent sensitive.11,12 However, newer tests may be more expensive, and not all tests are waived by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988.Whether negative RADT results in children and adolescents require confirmatory throat culture is controversial.
 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that negative RADT results in children be confirmed using throat culture unless physicians can guarantee that RADT sensitivity is similar to that of throat culture in their practice.13 False-negative RADT results may lead to misdiagnosis and GABHS spread and, very rarely, to increased suppurative and nonsuppurative complications.
 Other studies suggest that the sensitivity of newer optical immunoas-says approaches that of single-plate throat culture, obviating the need for back-up culture.14,15 In many clinical practices, confirmatory throat culture is not performed in children at low risk for GABHS infection.
 The precipitous drop in rheumatic fever in the United States, significant costs of additional testing and follow-up, and concerns about inappropriate antibiotic use are valid reasons why back-up cultures are not routinely performed.16Streptococcal antibody titers are not useful for diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis and are not routinely recommended.
 They may be indicated to confirm previous infection in persons with suspected acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis or rheumatic fever.
 Fusobacterium necrophorum causes endemic acute pharyngitis, peritonsillar abscess, and persistent sore throat.
 Untreated Fusobacterium infections may lead to Lemierre syndrome, an internal jugular vein thrombus caused by inflammation.
 Complications occur when septic plaques break loose and embolize.
 Empiric antibiotic therapy may reduce the incidence of complications.ANTIBIOTIC SELECTIONEffectiveness, spectrum of activity, safety, dosing schedule, cost, and compliance issues all require consideration.
 Penicillin, penicillin congeners (ampicillin or amoxicillin), clindamycin (Cleocin), and certain cephalosporins and macrolides are effective against GABHS.
 Based on cost, narrow spectrum of activity, safety, and effectiveness, penicillin is recommended by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP),18 the AAP,19 the American Heart Association,20 the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA),2 and the World Health Organization for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis.25  Options for penicillin dosing are listed in Table 3.2,17-20,28-34 When patients are unlikely to complete the entire course of antibiotics, a single intramuscular dose of penicillin G benzathine (Bicillin L-A) is an option.
 A premixed penicillin G benzathine/procaine injection (Bicillin C-R) lessens injection-associated discomfort.
 Over the past 50 years, no increase in minimal inhibitory concentration or resistance to GABHS has been documented for penicillins or cephalosporins.28Oral amoxicillin suspension is often substituted for penicillin because it tastes better.
 The medication is also available as chewable tablets.
 Five of eight trials (1966 to 2000) showed greater than 85 percent GABHS eradication with the use of amoxicillin.29 [ corrected] Ten days of therapy is standard; common dosages are provided in Table 3.2,17-20,28-34 Amoxicillin taken once per day is likely as effective as a regimen of three times per day.
 One randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated comparable symptom relief with once-daily dosing, although like almost all studies of pharyngitis treatment, the trial was not powered to detect nonsuppurative complications.30 A recent study of children three to 18 years of age showed that once-daily dosing of amoxicillin was not inferior to twice-daily dosing; both regimens had failure rates of about 20 percent.31 It should be noted that once-daily therapy is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).View/Print TableTable 3.Antibiotic Options for GABHS PharyngitisDrugClass of antimicrobialRoute of administrationDosageDuration of therapyCost*Primary treatment (recommended by current guidelines)Penicillin V (Veetids; brand no longer available in the United States)PenicillinOralChildren: 250 mg two to three times per day10 days$4Adolescents and adults: 250 mg three to four times per dayor500 mg two times per dayAmoxicillinPenicillin (broad spectrum)OralChildren (mild to moderate GABHS pharyngitis):10 days$412.25 mg per kg two times per dayor10 mg per kg three times per dayChildren (severe GABHS pharyngitis): 22.5 mg per kg two times per dayor13.3 mg per kg three times per dayor750 mg (not FDA approved) once per day†Adults (mild to moderate GABHS pharyngitis):250 mg three times per dayor500 mg two times per dayAdults (severe GABHS pharyngitis): 875 mg two times per dayPenicillin G benzathine (Bicillin L-A)PenicillinIntramuscularChildren: &gt;                Purchase Access:See My OptionscloseAlready a member or subscriber?
