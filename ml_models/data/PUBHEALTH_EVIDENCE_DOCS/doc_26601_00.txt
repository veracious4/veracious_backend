 In California, not only can they confiscate guns, but ammunition and accessories as well.
 Once your guns are confiscated it is almost impossible to get them back even after you prove your guns should not have been confiscated to begin with.
 Tony Evers (D) is pushing a red flag law that would allow a judge to issue orders resulting in firearm confiscation.
 Kaul said the law “will allow law enforcement or family members to go to a judge and ensure that somebody who is a threat to themselves or others is temporarily disarmed.” Red flag laws have become a popular gun control over the past few years and particularly since the February 14, 2018, Parkland school shooting.
 For example, in 2018, California’s law was amended to make it easier to get a confiscation order, and on January 1, 2019, it was broadened to allow confiscation of ammunition and firearm accessories.
