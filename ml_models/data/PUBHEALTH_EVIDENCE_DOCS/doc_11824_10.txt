 We work with corrections administrators in all 50 states to help develop comprehensive plans to combat those challenges.
 Juvenile Justice While juvenile incarceration rates have dropped dramatically over the past decade, most juvenile justice systems are not operating as effectively as possible.
 Our team works with communities across the country to adopt and more effectively implement policies and practices shown to reduce recidivism and improve other youth outcomes.
 Law Enforcement Increasingly, law enforcement officers are the first, and often the only, responders to calls involving people with behavioral health needs.
 Our team works with communities across the country to support law enforcement leaders and officers to improve their responses to this growing population.
 Mental Health Across the country, communities are struggling to address the high number of people with mental health needs cycling through the criminal justice system each year.
 In many communities, correctional facilities provide more treatment for people with mental illnesses than community-based mental health providers do.
 Our team works with states and local communities to improve responses for people with mental health needs in the criminal justice system.
 Reentry Each year, millions of people return to their communities from jail or prison.
 Ensuring people’s safe and successful transition from incarceration to the community is challenging and highly complex.
 Reentry is more than staying out of jail or prison; it also involves reuniting families, eliminating barriers to employment, finding stable housing, and much more.
 Our team works with communities across the country to provide people with the reentry supports they need.
 Substance Use A disproportionate number of people in the criminal justice system struggle with substance use disorders, many of whom also have co-occurring mental illnesses.
 Despite the success of some treatment programs for people in the criminal justice system, just a fraction of the people who need these services receive them.
 Our team works with communities across the U.S. to promote bring models of success to scale.
