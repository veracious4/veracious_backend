 ''Legitimate guys ain't got a chance,'' he said.He explained that the system was arranged by the ''Two Percent Club,'' an organization run by some of New York's largest mob families: the Genoveses, Gambinos, Luccheses and Colombos.
 #25 Years After Valachi Mr. Cafaro was the last of several current and former mobsters to testify before the subcommittee, which is reviewing the status of organized crime 25 years after Joseph F. Valachi described to the panel the Mafia's vast criminal enterprises.Mr.
 Cafaro, a slight, balding man from the Bronx, has said he has been involved with organized crime since 1958.
 In 1986, Mr. Cafaro and the boss of the Genovese family, Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno, were indicted in New York on charges that included racketeering, extortion, plotting murders, gambling and conspiracy.After he was indicted, Mr. Cafaro was an informer to Federal authorities for five months.
 He told the committee he had stopped cooperating with officials out of concern for his family, and is currently in custody while all charges are pending.Mr.
 Cafaro said crime families involved in the ''Two Percent Club'' shared profits from the construction industry.
 ''Club members split up all of the jobs over $2 million,'' he said.
 If the contract went over $5 million, it went to a mob-run company, S &amp; A Concrete.A defense lawyer in a Mafia trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan conceded last month that Paul Castellano, the Gambino crime family boss slain in 1985, had acquired a half-interest in the concrete company in 1981.
 'Very Disciplined Organization'Mr.
 Cafaro called the Genovese family a ''very disciplined organization'' that runs by strict rules.
 Serious violations are punishable by death.
 ''We don't kill innocent people,'' he said.
 ''We only kill rats,'' who fool around with another member's wife or who get mixed up with drugs.Mr.
 Cafaro said during ''good years'' he made up to $2 million by skimming funds from gambling and numbers rackets, and always carried several thousand dollars with him.
 ''I've never had a checking account,'' he said.
 ''I never needed one.
 ''When Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, asked what Mr. Cafaro did with the money, Mr. Cafaro said: ''I just spent it.
 I never got tired of going out.''Mr.
 Cafaro said he had few regrets about joining the mob.
 ''It's not good, it's not bad,'' he said.
 ''But you get respect all over the city.
