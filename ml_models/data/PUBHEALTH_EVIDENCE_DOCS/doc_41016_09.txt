A.
 
Immediate implementation of appropriate IPC measures
 
IPC is a critical and integral part of clinical 
management of patients and should be initiated at 
the point of entry of the patient to hospital (typically the Emergency Department). Standard 
precautions should always be routinely applied in all areas of health care facilities. Standard 
precautions inclu

body fluids, secretions (including respiratory secretions) and non
-
intact skin. Standard 
precautions also include prevention of needle
-
stick or sharps injury; safe waste management; 
cleaning and disinfection of equipment; and cleaning of the environment.

At triage
 

 
Give suspect patient a 
triple layer 
surgical
 
mask and direct patient to separate 
area, an isolation room if available. Keep at least 1meter distance between 
suspected patients and other patients. Instruct all patients to cover nose and 
mouth during coughing or sneezing with tissue or flexed 
elbow for others. 
Perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions
 
 Page |

Apply droplet 
precautions
 

 
Droplet precautions prevent large droplet transmission of respiratory viruses. 
Use a 
triple layer surgical 
mask if working within 1
-
2 metres of the 
patient. 
Place patients in single rooms, or group together those with the same 
etiological diagnosis. If an etiological diagnosis is not possible, group patients 
with similar clinical diagnosis and based on epidemiological risk factors, with 
a spatial sepa
ration. When providing care in close contact with a patient with 
respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughing or sneezing), use eye protection (face
-
mask or goggles), because sprays of secretions may occur. Limit patient 
movement within the institution and ensure t
hat patients wear 
triple layer 
surgical
 
masks when outside their rooms
 
Apply contact 
precautions
 

 
Droplet and contact precautions prevent direct or indirect transmission from 
contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment (i.e. contact with 
contaminated 
oxygen tubing/interfaces). Use PPE (
triple layer surgical
 
mask, 
eye protection, gloves and gown) when entering room and remove PPE when 
leaving. If possible, use either disposable or dedicated equipment (e.g. 
stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs and thermome
ters). If equipment needs to 
be shared among patients, clean and disinfect between each patient use. 
Ensure that health care workers refrain from touching their eyes, nose, and 
mouth with potentially contaminated gloved or ungloved hands. Avoid 
contaminati
ng environmental surfaces that are not directly related to patient 
care (e.g. door handles and light switches). Ensure adequate room ventilation. 
Avoid movement of patients or transport. Perform hand hygiene
.
 
Apply airborne
 
precautions 
when 
performing an 
aerosol
 
generating 
procedure
 

 
Ensure that healthcare workers performing aerosol
-
generating procedures (i.e. 
open suctioning of respiratory tract, intubation, bronchoscopy, 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation) use PPE, including gloves, long
-
sleeved 
gowns, eye pro
tection,
 
and fit
-
tested particulate respirators (N95). (The 
scheduled fit test should not be confused with user seal check before each 
use.) Whenever possible, use adequately ventilated single rooms when 
performing aerosol
-
generating procedures, meaning ne
gative pressure rooms 
with minimum of 12 air changes per hour or at least 160 litres/second/patient 
in facilities with natural ventilation. Avoid the presence of unnecessary 
individuals in the room. Care for the patient in the same type of room after 
mecha
nical ventilation commences

Early supportive therapy and monitoring

distress, 
hypoxaemia, or shock: Initiate oxygen therapy at 5 L/min and titrate flow rates to 
reach target SpO

Children with emergency signs (obstructed or absent breathing, severe respiratory 
distress, central cyanosis, shock, coma or convulsions) should receive oxygen therapy 
during resuscitation to target SpO

where patients with SARI are cared for should be equipped with pulse oximeters, 
fu
nctioning oxygen systems and disposable, single

use, oxygen
-
delivering interfaces 
(nasal cannula, simple face mask, and mask with reservoir bag). Use contact precautions 
when handling contaminated oxygen interfaces of patients with 
COVID 

 
19
.
 
b.
 
Use conserva
tive fluid management in patients with SARI when there is no evidence of 
shock: Patients with SARI should be treated cautiously with intravenous fluids, because 
aggressive fluid resuscitation may worsen oxygenation, especially in settings where there 
is li
mited availability of mechanical ventilation
.
 
c.
 
Give empiric antimicrobials to treat all likely pathogens causing SARI. Give 
antimicrobials within one hour of initial patient assessment for patients with sepsis: 
Although the patient may be suspected to have 
COVID 
-

, 
A
dminister appropriate 
empiric antimicrobials within ONE hour of identification of sepsis. Empiric
al
 
antibiotic 
treatment should be based on the clinical diagnosis (community
-
acquired pneumonia, 
health care
-
associated pneumonia [if infection wa
s acquired in healthcare setting], or 
sepsis), local epidemiology and susceptibility data, and treatment 
g
uidelines. Empiric
al
 
therapy includes a neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza when there is local 
circulation or other risk factors, incl
uding travel history or expos
ure to animal influenza 
viruses. 
 
Empiric
al
 
therapy should be de
-
escalated on the basis of microbiology results 
and clinical judgment
 
d.
 
Do not routinely give systemic corticosteroids for treatment of viral pneumonia or ARDS 
outsi
de of clinical trials unless they are indicated for another reason: A systematic review 
of observational studies of corticosteroids administered to patients with SAR
S
 
reported 
no survival benefit and possible harms (avascular necrosis, psychosis, diabetes, and 
delayed viral clearance). A systematic review of observational studies in influenza found 
a higher risk of mortality and secondary infections with corticosteroid
s; the evidence was 
 Page | 
8
 
 
 
judged as very low to low quality due to confounding by indication. A subsequent study 
that addressed this limitation by adjusting for time
-
varying confounders found no effect 
on mortality. Finally, a recent study of patients receiving 
corticosteroids for MERS used a 
similar statistical approach and found no effect of corticosteroids on mortality but delayed 
lower respiratory tract (LRT) clearance of MERS
-
CoV. Given lack of effectiveness and 
possible harm, routine corticosteroids should 
be avoided unless they are indicated for 
another reason. See section 
F
 
for the use of corticosteroids in sepsis
.
 
e.
 
Closely monitor patients with SARI for signs of clinical deterioration, such as rapidly 
progressive respiratory failure and sepsis, and apply s
upportive care interventions 
immediately:

alerts
 
Points to remember
 

 
Collect blood cultures for bacteria 
that cause pneumonia and sepsis, ideally before 
antimicrobial therapy. DO NOT delay antimicrobial therapy to collect blood cultures
 

 
Collect specimens 
of nasopharyngeal and oro 

 
pharyngeal swab for RT 
-
 
PCR. 
Clinicians may  
also 
collect LRT 
(Lower Respirat
ory Tract) 
samples when these are 
readily available (for example, in mechanically ventilated patients)
.
 

 
Use appropriate PPE for specimen collection (droplet and contact precautions for URT 
specimens; airborne precautions for LRT specimens). When collecting
 
URT samples, use 
viral swabs (sterile Dacron or rayon, not cotton) and viral transport media. Do not sample 
 Page | 
9
 
 
 
the nostrils or tonsils. In a patient with suspected 
COVID 
-
 
19
, especially with pneumonia 
or severe illness, a single URT sample does not exclude 
the diagnosis, and additional 
URT and LRT samples are recommended. Sputum induction should be avoided due to 
increased risk of increasing aerosol transmission.
 

 
Dual infections with other respiratory viral infections have been found in SARS and 
MERS cases. 
At this stage we need detailed microbiologic studies in all suspected 
COVID 
-
 
19
 
cases. Both URT and LRT specimens can 
be 
tested for other respiratory 
viruses, such as influenza A and B (including zoonotic influenza A), respiratory syncytial 
virus, parainf
luenza viruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses (e.g. EVD68), 
human metapneumovirus, and endemic human coronaviruses (i.e. HKU1, OC43, NL63, 
and 229E). LRT specimens can also be tested for bacterial p
athogens, including 
Legionella p
neumophila
.
 

 
In
 
hospitalized patients with confirmed 
COVID 
-
 
19
 
infection, repeat URT
 
samples 
should be collected to demonstrate viral clearance. The frequency of specimen collection 
will depend on local circumstances but should be 
done 
at least every 2 to 4 days until 
there are two con
secutive negative results (of 
URT samples) in a clinically recovered 
patient at least 24 hours apart. 
 
 
D.
 
Management of hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS
 

 
Recognize severe hypoxemic respiratory failure when a patient with respiratory 
distress is 
failing standard oxygen therapy. Patients may continue to have increased work of 
breathing or hypoxemia even when oxygen is delivered via a face mask with reservoir 
bag (flow rates of 10
-
15 L/min, which is typically the minimum flow required to
 
maintain 
bag inflation; FiO
2
 
0.60
-
0.95). Hypoxemic respiratory failure in ARDS commonly results 
from intrapulmonary ventilation
-
perfusion mismatch or shunt and usually requires 
mechanical ventilation
.
 

 
High 

 
flow nasal catheter oxygenation or non 

 
invasi
ve mechanical ventilation: When 
respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia of the patient cannot be alleviated after receiving 
standard oxygen therapy, high 

 
flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy or non 

 
invasive 
ventilation can be considered. If conditions do no
t improve or even get worse within a 
short time (1 

 
2 hours), tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be 
 Page | 
10
 
 
 
used in a timely manner. 
Compared to standard oxygen therapy, HFNO reduces the need 
for intubation. Patients with hypercapnia (
exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, 
cardiogenic pulmonary
 
oedema), hemodynamic instability, multi
-
organ failure, or 
abnormal mental status should generally not receive HFNO, although emerging data 
suggest that HFNO may be safe in patients with mild
-
m
oderat
e and non
-
worsening 
hypercapnia
25
.
 
Patients receiving HFNO should be in a monitored setting and cared for by 
experienced personnel capable of endotracheal intubation in case the patient acutely 
deteriorates or does not improve after a short trial (ab
out 1 hr). 
 

 
NIV guidelines make no recommendation on use in hypoxemic respiratory failure (apart 
from cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and post
-
operative respiratory failure) or pandemic 
viral illness (referring to studies of SARS and pandemic influenza). Risk
s include delayed 
intubation, large tidal volumes, and injurious transpulmonary pressures. Limited data 
suggest a high failure rate when MERS patients receive
d
 
NIV. Patients receiving a trial of 
NIV should be in a monitored setting and cared for by experienced personnel capable of 
endotracheal intubation in case the patient acutely deteriorates or does not improve after a 
short trial (about 1 hr). Patients with 
hemodynamic instability, multiorgan failure, or 
abnormal mental status should not receive NIV.
 

 
Recent publications suggest that newer HFNO and NIV systems with good interface 
fitting do not create widespread dispersion of exhaled air and therefore should b
e 
associated with low risk of airborne transmission.
 

 
Endotracheal intubation should be performed by a trained and experienced provider using 
airborne precautions. Patients with ARDS, especially young children or those who are 
obese or pregnant, may de
-
satu
rate quickly during intubation. Pre
-
oxygenate with 100% 
FiO
2
 
for 5 minutes, via a face mask with reservoir bag, bag
-
valve mask, HFNO, or NIV. 
Rapid sequence intubation is appropriate after an airway assessment that identifies no 
signs of difficult intubati
on.
 
 

 
Implement mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4

8 ml/kg predicted body 
weight, PBW) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure <30 cmH
2
O). This is a 
strong recommendation from a clinical guideline for patients with ARDS, and is 
su
ggested for patients with sepsis
-
induced respiratory failure
.
 
The initial tidal volume is 6 
ml/kg PBW; tidal volume up to 8 ml/kg PBW is allowed if undesirable side effects occur 
(e.g. dyssynchrony, pH <7.15). Hypercapnia is permitted if meeting the pH goa
l of 7.30
-
 Page | 
11
 
 
 
7.45. Ventilator protocols are available. The use of deep sedation may be requir
ed to 
control respiratory drive 
and achieve tidal volume targets. 
 

 
In patients with severe ARDS, prone ventilation for >12 hours per day is recommended. 
Application o
f prone ventilation is strongly recommended for adult and paediatric 
patients with severe ARDS but requires sufficient human resources and expertise to be 
performed safely.
 
 

 
Use a conservative fluid management strategy for ARDS patients without tissue 
hypo
perfusion.
 

 
In patients with moderate or severe ARDS, higher PEEP instead of lower PEEP is 
suggested.
 
PEEP titration requires consideration of benefits (reducing atelectrauma and 
improving alveolar recruitment) vs. risks (end
-
inspiratory overdistension lead
ing to lung 
injury and higher pulmonary vascular resistance). Tables are available to guide PEEP 
titration based on the FiO
2
 
required to maintain SpO
2
. A related intervention of 
recruitment manoeuvres (RMs) is delivered as episodic periods of high continuo
us 
positive airway pressure [30

40 cm H
2
O], progressive incremental increases in
 
PEEP 
with constant driving pressure, or high driving pressure; considerations of benefits vs. 
risks are similar. Higher PEEP and RMs were both conditionally recommended in a 
clinical practice guideline. 
 
In patients with moderate
-
severe ARDS (PaO
2
/FiO
2
 
<15
0), 
neuromuscular blockade by continuous infusion should not be routinely used. 
 

 
In settings with access to expertise in extracorporeal life support (ECLS), consider 
referral of patients with refractory hypoxemia despite lung protective ventilation. 
ECLS 
s
hould only be offered in expert centres with a sufficient case volume to maintain 
expertise and that can apply the IPC measures required for
 
COVID 

 
19 
patients
 

 
Avoid disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, which results in loss of PEEP and 
atelecta
sis. Use in
-
line catheters for airway suctioning and clamp endotracheal tube when 
disconnection is required (for example, transfer to a transport ventilator)
 
 
E.
 
Management of septic shock
 

 
Recognize septic shock in adults when infection is suspected or confir
med AND 

 Page | 
12
 
 
 
lactate is 
< 2
 
mmol/L, in absence of hypovolemia. Recognize septic shock in children 
with any hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] <5th centile or >2 SD below norma
l 
for age) or 2
-
3 of the following: altered mental state; tachycardia or bradycardia (HR <90 
bpm or >160 bpm in infants and HR <70 bpm or >150 bpm in children); prolonged 
capillary refill (>2 sec) or warm vasodilation with bounding pulses; tachypnea; mottl
ed 
skin or petechial or purpuric rash; increased lactate; oliguria; hyperthermia or 
hypothermia.
 

 
In the absence of a lactate measurement, use MAP and clinical signs of perfusion to 
define shock. Standard care includes early recognition and the following tr
eatments 
within 1 hour of recognition: antimicrobial therapy and fluid loading and vasopressors for 
hypotension. The use of central venous and arterial catheters should be based on resource 
availability and individual patient needs. Detailed guidelines are
 
available for the 
management of septic shock in adults and children.
 
 

 
In resuscitation from septic shock in adults, give at least 30 ml/kg of isotonic crystalloid 
in adults in the first 3 hours. In resuscitation from septic shock in children in 
well
-
resourced settings, give 20 ml/kg as a rapid bolus and up to 40
-
60 ml/kg in the first 1 hr.
 
Do not use hypotonic crystalloids, starches, or gelatins for resuscitation.
 

 
Fluid resuscitation may lead to volume overload, including respiratory failure. If 
there is 
no response to fluid loading and signs of volume overload appear (for example, jugular 
venous distension, crackles on lung auscultation, pulmonary oedema on imaging, or 
hepatomegaly in children), then reduce or discontinue fluid administration. Th
is step is 
particularly important where mechanical ventilation is not available. Alternate fluid 
regimens are suggested when caring for children in resource
-
limited settings.
 

 

ional 
fluid boluses (250
-
1000 ml in adults or 10
-
20 ml/kg in children) based on clinical 
response and improvement of perfusion targets. Perfusion targets include MAP (>65 
mmHg or age
-
appropriate targets in children), urine output (>0.5 ml/kg/hr in adults, 
1 
ml/kg/hr in children), and improvement of skin mottling, capillary refill, level of 
consciousness, and lactate. Consider dynamic indices of volume responsiveness to guide 
volume administration beyond initial resuscitation based on local resources and 
exp
erience. These indices include passive leg raises, fluid challenges with serial stroke 
volume measurements, or variations in systolic pressure, pulse pressure, inferior vena

cava size, or stroke volume in response to changes in intrathoracic pressure durin
g 
mechanical ventilation.
 

 
Administer vasopressors when shock persists during or after fluid resuscitation. The 

-
appropriate 
targets in children.
 

 
If central venous catheters are not available, v
asopressors can be given through a 
peripheral IV, but use a large vein and closely monitor for signs of extravasatio
n and local 
tissue necrosis. If 
extravasation occurs, stop infusion. Vasopressors can also be 
administered through intraosseous needles.
 

 
If 
signs of poor perfusion and cardiac dysfunction persist despite achieving MAP target 
with fluids and vasopressors, consider an inotrope such as dobutamine

Other Therapeutic Measures: 
 
For patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators, r

be used 
for
 
a short period of time (3 to 5 days). It is recommended that dose should not 
exceed the 
equivalent of methylprednisolon
e 1 

 
2mg/kg/day. Note that a larger dose of 
glucocorticoid will delay the removal of coronavirus due to immunosuppressive effects. 
For 
pregnant severe and critical cases, pregnancy should be 
preferably 
terminated. 
Consultations 
with obstetric, neonatal, a
nd intensive care specialists (depending on the condition of the 
mother) are essential. 
Patients often suffer from anxiety and fear and they should be 
supported by psychological counselling.

Prevention of complications
 
Implement the following interventio
ns (Table 4) to prevent complications associated with 
critical illness. These interventions are based on Surviving Sepsis or other guidelines, and are 
generally limited to feasible recommendations based on high quality evidence.

plications
 
Anticipated 
Outcome
 
Interventions
 
Reduce days of 
invasive
 
mechanical 
ventilation
 

 
Use weaning protocols that include daily assessment for readiness to 
breathe spontaneously
 

 
Minimize continuous or intermittent sedation, targeting specific 
titration 
endpoints (light sedation unless contraindicated) or with daily interruption 
of continuous sedative infusions

Reduce incidence 
of ventilator
 
associated 
pneumonia
 

 
Oral intubation is preferable to nasal intubation in adolescents and adults
 

 
Keep 
patient in semi
-
recumbent position (head of bed elevation 30
-
45º)
 

 
Use a closed suctioning system; periodically drain and discard condensate 
in tubing
 

 
Use a new ventilator circuit for each patient; once patient is ventilated, 
change circuit if it is soiled 
or damaged but not routinely
 

 
Change heat moisture exchanger when it malfunctions, when soiled, or 
every 5

7 days
 
Reduce incidence 
of venous
 
thromboembolism
 

 
Use pharmacological prophylaxis (low molecular
-
weight heparin 
[preferred if available] or heparin 
5000 units subcutaneously twice daily) 
in adolescents and adults without contraindications. For those with 
contraindications, use mechanical prophylaxis (intermittent pneumatic 
compression devices).
 
Reduce incidence 
of catheter related 
bloodstream 
infection
 

 
Use a checklist with completion verified by a real
-
time observer as 
reminder of each step needed for sterile insertion and as a daily reminder to 
remove catheter if no longer needed
 
Reduce incidence 
of pressure
 
ulcers
 

 
Turn patient every two 
hours
 
Reduce incidence 
of stress ulcers
 
and 
gastrointestinal 
bleeding
 

 
Give early enteral nutrition (within 24

48 hours of admission)
 

 
Administer histamine
-
2 receptor blockers or proton
-
pump inhibitors in 
patients with risk factors for GI bleeding. Risk 
factors for gastrointestinal 

replacement
 
therapy, liver disease, multiple co
-
morbidities, and higher 
organ failure score
 
Reduce incidence 
of ICU
-
related
 
weakness
 

 
Actively mobilize 
the patient early in the course of illness when safe to do 
so

treatments and clinical research
 
There is no current evidence from RCTs to recommend any 
specific treatment
 
for 
suspected 
or confirmed 
patients with 
COVID 
-
 
19
.
 
No specific anti

virals are recommended for 
treatment of COVID 

 
19 due to lack of adequate evidence from literature. The use of 
Lopinavir/ Ritonavir in PEP regimens for HIV (4 weeks) is also associated with significant 
adverse events which many a times le
ads to discontinuation of therapy. In light of the above, 
Lopinavir/ Ritonavir should ONLY be used with proper informed 
expressed 
consent
