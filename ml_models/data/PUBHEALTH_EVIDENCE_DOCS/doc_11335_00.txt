 We did a trial to assess late complications, acute side-effects, and survival associated with proton radiotherapy in children with medulloblastoma.MethodsIn this non-randomised, open-label, single-centre, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients aged 3–21 years who had medulloblastoma.
 Patients had craniospinal irradiation of 18–36 Gy radiobiological equivalents (GyRBE) delivered at 1·8 GyRBE per fraction followed by a boost dose.
 The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of ototoxicity at 3 years, graded with the Pediatric Oncology Group ototoxicity scale (0–4), in the intention-to-treat population.
 Secondary outcomes were neuroendocrine toxic effects and neurocognitive toxic effects, assessed by intention-to-treat.
 This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00105560.FindingsWe enrolled 59 patients from May 20, 2003, to Dec 10, 2009: 39 with standard-risk disease, six with intermediate-risk disease, and 14 with high-risk disease.
 59 patients received chemotherapy.
 Median follow-up of survivors was 7·0 years (IQR 5·2–8·6).
 All patients received the intended doses of proton radiotherapy.
 The median craniospinal irradiation dose was 23·4 GyRBE (IQR 23·4–27·0) and median boost dose was 54·0 GyRBE (IQR 54·0–54·0).
 Four (9%) of 45 evaluable patients had grade 3–4 ototoxicity according to Pediatric Oncology Group ototoxicity scale in both ears at follow-up, and three (7%) of 45 patients developed grade 3–4 ototoxicity in one ear, although one later reverted to grade 2.
 The cumulative incidence of grade 3–4 hearing loss at 3 years was 12% (95% CI 4–25).
 At 5 years, it was 16% (95% CI 6–29).
 Pediatric Oncology Group hearing ototoxicity score at a follow-up of 5·0 years (IQR 2·9–6·4) was the same as at baseline or improved by 1 point in 34 (35%) of 98 ears, worsened by 1 point in 21 (21%), worsened by 2 points in 35 (36%), worsened by 3 points in six (6%), and worsened by 4 points in two (2%).
 Full Scale Intelligence Quotient decreased by 1·5 points (95% CI 0·9–2·1) per year after median follow-up up of 5·2 years (IQR 2·6–6·4), driven by decrements in processing speed and verbal comprehension index.
 Perceptual reasoning index and working memory did not change significantly.
 Cumulative incidence of any neuroendocrine deficit at 5 years was 55% (95% CI 41–67), with growth hormone deficit being most common.
 We recorded no cardiac, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal late toxic effects.
 3-year progression-free survival was 83% (95% CI 71–90) for all patients.
 In post-hoc analyses, 5-year progression-free survival was 80% (95% CI 67–88) and 5-year overall survival was 83% (95% CI 70–90).InterpretationProton radiotherapy resulted in acceptable toxicity and had similar survival outcomes to those noted with conventional radiotherapy, suggesting that the use of the treatment may be an alternative to photon-based treatments.FundingUS National Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital.IntroductionMedulloblastoma is the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour.1Packer RJ Vezina G Management of and prognosis with medulloblastoma: therapy at a crossroads.Arch Neurol.

 There are few prospective studies providing outcome data for patients treated with proton radiotherapy and none with follow-up longer than 3 years.
 Several retrospective studies have assessed disease outcome and late effects.Added value of this studyTo the best of our knowledge, no other data for the late effects or disease control of proton therapy for patients with medulloblastoma are as complete and mature as ours.
 Our findings on toxic effects provide a benchmark by which toxic effects of radiation treatment can be assessed.
 Advantages of this dataset are that it meticulously documents late effects and was prospectively collected, avoiding the bias of retrospective studies.Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings suggest that proton radiotherapy seems to have an acceptable toxicity profile and similar survival outcomes to photon-based treatment.
 This study could serve as a template for other outcomes-based studies in different populations to better define the role of proton radiotherapy for the treatment of other cancers.In addition to dose and volume reduction, proton radiotherapy is increasingly used to try to mitigate late effects in children.11Chang AL Yock TI Mahajan A et al.Pediatric proton therapy: patterns of care across the United States.Int J Particle Ther.

 2015; 11: 267-278Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar Because of concerns of late effects caused by photon radiation, we did a phase 2 study of proton radiotherapy in children with medulloblastoma with the objectives of assessing ototoxicity, and late complications, acute side-effects, and survival.Methods Study design and participantsWe enrolled patients with histologically confirmed medulloblastoma or pineoblastoma based on a biopsy sample or attempted resection who were aged 3–21 years at the time of diagnosis in our open-label, phase 2, single-centre study at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA, USA).
 Patients could be concurrently enrolled on other cooperative group studies or referring institutional studies.
 Surgical removal of the primary tumour was attempted in all patients.
 However, not all patients had a full resection.
 If residual disease at the primary site was greater than or equal to 1·5 cm2 on axial MRI, then they would be classified as high risk if they had no other evidence of metastatic disease.
 Patients were staged with a brain MRI before and after surgery, as well as spine MRI and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid cytology a minimum of 10 days after surgery.
 Cerebrospinal fluid cytology could be omitted if patients had visible metastatic disease observed with MRI in the brain or spine (M2 or M3 disease).
 All pathology was centrally reviewed.
 Patients were required to start radiation within 35 days of definitive surgery unless they were receiving upfront chemotherapy.
 Patients were excluded if they had recurrent disease, progression on chemotherapy, or any history of radiation or methotrexate.This study was approved by an institutional review board.
 Patients or their parent or guardian provided written informed consent.
 ProceduresAt enrolment, patients were categorised as having standard-risk or high-risk disease according to Children's Oncology Group criteria.1Packer RJ Vezina G Management of and prognosis with medulloblastoma: therapy at a crossroads.Arch Neurol.
