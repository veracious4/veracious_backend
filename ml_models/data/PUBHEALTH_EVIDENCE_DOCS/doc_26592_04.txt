 These nationwide closures are impacting hundreds of millions of students.
 Several other countries have implemented localized closures impacting millions of additional learners.
 UNESCO is supporting countries in their efforts to mitigate the immediate impact of school closures, particularly for more vulnerable and disadvantaged communities, and to facilitate the continuity of education for all through remote learning.
