The Asylum System in Northern Ireland
 
Immigration law is an excepted matter and therefore not devolved. Th
e asylum system
2
 
is provided for in the Immigration Rules

. The process of applying for asylum is 
summarised

.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 2015 35% of appeals were allowed. This has to a certain extent led to a lack of faith 
in the asylum system if a full third of decisions are assessed to be wrong, potentially 
sending p
eople to countries where they would not be safe

Support to Asylum Seekers in the UK
 
Support to asylum seekers in the UK is provided for in the Immigration and Asylum Act 
1999
6
. Sect
ion 95 
provides 
for support to destitute asylum seekers (referred to as 
Section 95 support).
 
People who have been refused asylum 
cease to receive support, 
but 
may apply for short
-
term support pending return to a home country
7
, except for 
those with 
children (under 18), who continue to receive support.
 
Section 4 
of the 1999 
Act 
provides for the provision of accommodation 
and a pre
-
paid payment card for food 
and essential items 
to asylum seekers whose application
s
 
have failed
, 
if eligible
 
for 
such supp

local authorities to provide accommodation under certain circumstances.

policy remains within the competence of the UK
 
Parliament. Therefore, there is limited 
opportunity for the Northern Ireland Executive, and agencies such as the Northern 
Ireland Housing Executive and Social Security Agency
,
 
to deviate from either social 
security or housing accommodation eligibility cri
teria in relation to refused asylum 
seekers. 
 
Accommodation
 
With regards to homelessness amongst refused asylum seekers, Article 22(A) of the 
Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1981
15
 
stipulates that the Housing Executive shall not 
allocate housing accommodat
ion to a person from abroad if he/she is a person subject 
to immigration control who is ineligible for an allocation of housing accommodation by 
virtue of the terms of the Immigration Act 1999
16
.  In March 
2016
, the then Minister for 
Social Development outl
ined further the position of the Northern Ireland Housing 
Executive in respect to refused asylum seekers who are homeless
17
:
 

to failed Asylum Seekers or others with no recourse to public funds and must 
operate within the bounds of UK immigration law.  
 
Persons subject to immigration control and other pers
ons from abroad with no 
recourse to public funds are entitled to free advice in relation to homelessness 
and the prevention of homelessness.  This may
 
include referring the applicant
 
to other support agencies.  If the Housing Executive has decided the 
homeless applicant is a person who is ineligible but believes they are 
destitute, and has a pre
-
existing care need or has children in the household, 
the Housing Executive may secure the 
services of the Department of Health, 
Social Services and public safety under the Health & Personal Social Services 
under the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 to provide services for 
persons under 18 who are children in need.  Therefore, the Housing 
Executive 
will make a referral to the relevant Health and Social Service Trust in such 

 
Health care
 
It was formerly the case that appeals exhausted asylum seekers were only entitled to 
free emergency care, maternity care and treatment for infect
ious diseases. 
However, 
on 17 September 2014 an official of the Department of Health, Social Services and 
Public Safety (DHSSPS) briefed the

The

Quite simply, the legislation will leave it that anybody who makes an application for 
asylum will be entitled to free primary and secondary health care.  That will apply if 
they have made an application; it will not matter whether th
eir application has been 
approved or turned down.  So, that includes all asylum seekers.

Other Jurisdictions
 
This section briefly summarises arrangements in other jurisdictions.
 
 
Scotland
 
As in the rest 
of the UK, if an asylum claim fails and Section 4 support is refused, then 
statutory support ends
19
. 
 
Guidance in relation to NHS treatment in Scotland states
20
:
 

Anyone who has made a 
formal
 
application for asylum, whether pending or 
unsuccessful, is entitl
ed to treatment on the same basis as a UK national who is 
ordinarily resident in Scotland while they remain in the country. If their application to 
remain in the UK is successful, they will be granted refugee status and will continue 
to be exempt from NHS 
charges on the same basis as a person ordinarily resident in 
Scotland

 
Registration for primary care is at the discretion or GPs, secondary care is free for all 
applicants regardless of outcome.
 
Wales
 
As with Scotland, Section 4 support is the only statut
ory recourse for support if an 
asylum application fails.
 
Guidance by Primary Care Quality states
21
:
 
Wales Government issued new Regulations in 2009 stating that any person in Wales 
who has claimed asylum (regardless of the outcome) falls within the overseas
 
exemption category and therefore cannot be charged for treatment prior to 
repatriation
.
 
Registration for primary care is at the discretion or GPs, secondary care is free for all 
applicants regardless of outcome.
 
Republic of Ireland
 
Asylum seekers are hand
led through the Direct Provision system, where they are 
provided with accommodation, meals, medical care and financial support. Those 
whose applications have failed remain in Direct Provision 
on a discretionary basis 
until 
they are deported and therefore c
ontinue to receive support up to that point

Options for Additional Support
 
Broadly speaking, access to health care for appeals exhausted asylum seekers 
have 
been addressed through the 20
15 Regulations. Formal 
financial support is a challenge, 
although a combination of the Crisis Fund and private charity has to some degree 
alleviated destitution in this respect. The key challenge remains access to 
accommodation.
 
This section summarises some of options for additi
onal support.
 
Direct negotiations with the UK Government:
 
The Northern Ireland Executive is 
significantly constrained by legislation which prevents it from providing refused asylum 
seekers with access to social security benefits, social housing and other 
of sources of 
support which require public funding.  Direct discussions between the NI Executive and 
the UK Government may be the only means by which significant flexibilities can be 
negotiated.  The Scottish Gov
ernment is
 
currently in discussions with the
 
UK 
Government on greater devolved powers in relation to the operation of asylum support.  
This is a result of the outworking of the Smith Commission Report on further devolution 
of powers to the Scottish Parliament.
 
The Smith Commission explained
 
Followin
g the outcome of the Scottish independence referendum, the Prime Minister 
announced the appointment of Lord Smith to take forward proposals made in a joint 
declaration by the three pro
-
union parties of more powers for the Scottish Parliament in 
the event o

recommendations for further devolution of powers to strengthen the Scottish 
Parliament within the UK.  Greater devolved (non
-
legislative) powers in respect of 
asylum support was one (of man
y other issues) identified in the report.

All individuals wishing to lodge an in

for the asylum screening unit in Croydon 
unless there are reasons for the screening

taken place with partners to ensure that 
applicants are aware of this process when 
they seek to make an asylum application.

make their o

before referring to the Glasgow asylum 
team for screening.

With regards to MSPs correspondence, UK

homelessness, and the prevention of homelessness, is available free of charge to any 
person in Northern Ireland.  It fu
rther enables the Housing Executive to pay grants or to 
make loans or other assistance available to person
s

T
he interpretation and application
 
of
 
immigration legislation is a very complex area of 
law.   Unfortunately, it is not within the remit of the Northern Ireland Assembly 
Research and Information Service (RaISe) to provide legal advice and so we are not a 
po
sition to comment on the accuracy of the interpretation of the legislation set out in 
the legal opinion.  
 
However, it is clear that this is an area that could be explored further in terms of its 
potential for the Northern Ireland Executive to use block gr
ants funding to either (a) 
directly provide funding and resources through statutory agencies or (b) provide 
funding and resources to non
-

-
profit organisations to support destitute refused 
asylum seekers in accordance with immigration law.
 
In particular,
 
the Housing 
Executive might look at the extent to which the Supporting People programme
28
 
is 
constrained by restrictions on persons with no access to public funds.
 
Is it legally feasible for the Northern Ireland Executive to provide funding to assist non

Overview
 
This section gives a broad summary of support to appeal rights exhausted asylum 
seekers in Northern Ireland and suggests a range of opportunities f
or support.
 
Currently, appeal rights exhausted asylum seekers can have access to the following 
support in Northern Ireland:
 
Financial support
 
There is no access to social security benefits. Destitute refused 
asylum seekers can receive support from private charities, community organisations 
and churches. There is the Crisis Fund, managed by the British Red Cross, but a very 
small proportion of r
ecipients 
of the Fund 
are refused asylum seekers
 
and this is not 
a permanent arrangement
31
.
 
Food is provided by homelessness organisations in 
Belfast and in some other cities and towns in Northern Ireland. Food banks are also a 
source of support.
 
Health Car
e
 
Access to primary care is free, but discretionary, and access to 
secondary and emergency care is free.
 
Accommodation
 
The position of the Housing Executive is that a lack of recourse to 
public funds disqualifies for anything more than homelessness advice.
 
Accommodation may be provided by 
private charities, community organisations and 
churches
 
and the Crisis Fund can pay for accommodation.
 
Beyond the humanitarian argument, there is a case that can be put in favour of the 
provision 
of basic needs, otherwise 
the resulting decline in health will create additional 
costs on the health system. The provision of accommodation remains the most 
problematic.
 
Options for change might be as follows:
 

 
Negotiation 
with the UK 
to exempt the Housing Executive of legislation b
arring 
provision of accommodation to appeal rights exhausted asylum seekers 
 

 
Alternative arrangements for the in
-
kind provision of facilities and/or services
 

 
Additional investment in or funding of alternative housing provision, such as in 
the

The Immigration Act 2016 provides for the withdrawal of Section 4 support for families 
in the event of appeal rights being exhausted. There may be opportunities to engage 
on the issue when Legislative Consent Motions are brought befor
e the Northern Ireland 
Assembly for the commencement of aspects of this legislation.
 
Legal challenge under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) may be an 
option in some circumstances, for example:
