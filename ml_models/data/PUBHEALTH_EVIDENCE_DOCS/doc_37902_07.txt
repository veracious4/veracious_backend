 Summary of eRumor: This is a forwarded email from 		the Office of Risk Management that says Gleneagles Hospital treated seven women 		after inhaling free perfume samples that they received in the mail.
 The warning said that the women died and the poisonings could be terrorist 		related.
 The Truth:  This warning is a hoax, 		according to an 		 		official notice from the Gleneagles Intan Medical Centre located in 		Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
 Also, the person whose 		name appeared in this eRumor from the Office of Risk Management told 		TruthOrFiction.com that they are not the originator of this warning.
 It appears that some prankster 		may have 		added an official representative from the Office of Risk Management in 		Washington, DC to lend credibility to the hoax which was also posted the 		facebook web site.
 This is a new version of an old eRumor that surfaced several years ago and 		TruthOrFiction.com has finding posted.
