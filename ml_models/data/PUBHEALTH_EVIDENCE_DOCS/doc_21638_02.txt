Storm causes overflow of untreated wastewater into rivers, lake By Don Behm of the Journal Sentinel Published on: 6/24/2011  An estimated 170.5 million gallons of untreated wastewater overflowed to rivers and Lake Michigan Tuesday and Wednesday from combined sanitary and storm sewers in central Milwaukee and eastern Shorewood, the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District said Friday in a report to state environmental regulators.The sewer overflows were the first of this year.
 No combined sewer overflows have occurred in MMSD's service area since the catastrophic storms and flooding of July 22-23 of last year.
 In those torrential rains, the district reported 1.98 billion gallons of combined sewer overflows.This week, district officials started combined sewer overflows around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday after heavy rains boosted sewer flows across the metropolitan area.Wastewater was pouring into the deep tunnel system at a rate of 3.8 million gallons per minute when MMSD Executive Director Kevin Shafer ordered closing of gates linking combined sewers to the deep tunnels.Combined sewer overflows that would have gone to the tunnels started discharging to waterways to save storage space for excess flows from communities served by separate sanitary sewers.
 This step is taken to prevent overflows from sanitary sewers and to prevent basement backups.Most of the wastewater in regional collection sewers continues flowing to a treatment plant during combined sewer overflows.The district's deep tunnel system can store a total of 521 million gallons.Around 8:45 p.m. Tuesday, Shafer ordered a second emergency measure known as blending to get more space in the tunnels for separate sanitary sewer flows.For the next 10 hours, an estimated total of 26.8 million gallons of untreated wastewater was pumped directly from the deep tunnels, disinfected with chlorine and mixed with fully treated wastewater from the Jones Island plant.
 The blended volume was discharged to Lake Michigan.The district is allowed to bypass treatment other than disinfection at Jones Island for up to 60 million gallons of wastewater in 24 hours during such extreme rainstorms.
