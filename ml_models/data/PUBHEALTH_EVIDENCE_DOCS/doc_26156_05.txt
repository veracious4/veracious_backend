 Even with the correction, experts say the report is misleading.

 A study from a conservative legal group suggesting that voting by mail opened the door to widespread fraud appears to have been based on flawed data.

 In an April report that warns of the risks of fraud in mail-in voting, a conservative legal group significantly inflated a key statistic, a ProPublica analysis found.
 The Public Interest Legal Foundation reported that more than 1 million ballots sent out to voters in 2018 were returned as undeliverable.
 Taken at face value, that would represent a 91% increase over the number of undeliverable mail ballots in 2016, a sign that a vote-by-mail system would be a “catastrophe” for elections, the group argued.
 However, after ProPublica provided evidence to PILF that it had in fact doubled the official government numbers, the organization corrected its figure.
 The number of undeliverable mail ballots dropped slightly from 2016 to 2018.
