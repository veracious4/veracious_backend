 But a daith piercing probably would not fit those requirements, I agree.Continue this thread level 113 points · 5 years agoDefinitely willing to give this a go for science!
 It looks like there's no actual studies yet but I'm eager to be a guinea pig!
 I get crippling migraines soooo frequently and the way I see it, if it works it's cheaper in the long run, if it doesn't, I still have a cool piercing!level 22 points · 5 years agoI've tried everything for my migraines...been on over 20+ medications, Botox, been to a chiropractor and so far the only thing that EVER worked was Darvocet (which they took off the market in 2010, and ever since it's been a losing battle, damn FDA).
 I would eat dirt if it cured migraines.
 I have also been to three different neurologists, a chiropractor and a general practitioner.
 The first neurologist would literally talk to me for 5 minutes, ask if my medications needed refilling (non of which he prescribed, they were from MedCheck) and then send me on my way.
 The second one had a horrible horrible nurse who would never return my calls, didn't notate things in my chart and was just a all over horrible human being.
 The last neurologist just didn't care.
 I would suggest things and he would scoff at them.
 He had what he knew worked and when those things didn't work for me, he immediately thought I was a drug addict.
 Nevermind that I would never have my prescriptions renewed until I had like one pill left, never had them renewed early, never asked for additional medications or saw multiple doctors at the same time.
 He was an ass and literally told me he could not help me and to find someone else.
 Because of this, I hate doctors.
 I don't want to go to them.
 I have had other issues and not sought out medical help, because after all I am just a drug addict who is looking for more medication.
 And Sorry about the rant.
 I'm done.
 steps off soapboxContinue this thread level 2Original Poster1 point · 5 years agoExactly!level 110 points · 5 years agoThere is no factual evidence to suggest this would work.level 110 points · 5 years agoI have my daith and have had migraines since I've had it.level 17 points · 5 years agoI have a daith and don't get migraines....
 I also didn't get them before my piercing, but I like anecdotal evidence so I'm going with it.Seriously though, you should get a daith.
 For science.
 Both ears just to be sure.level 15 points · 5 years agoI'm curious about this too.
 Like would it be effective if I only had it on one side or would I have to get both done?
 Very interesting stufflevel 14 points · 4 years agoWell I disagree with everyone saying it's fake.
 I suffer from severe migraines since I was 5 now 19.
 I got the daith piercing about a month or two ago.
 Not a headache since.
 The piercing was sort of painful but not to bad.
 Usually my headache are weather induced like if it's yucky outside.
 &gt;.&gt; just to be sure, you know..level 12 points · 5 years ago · edited 5 years agoThis goes around every so often, and in years past, it's been other piercings.
 So, whether that piercing is placed at an actual pressure point becomes fairly unpredictable.Even if it were on the right spot, how would it apply appropriate contact in a lasting way?level 12 points · 5 years agoHi!
 This caught my eye a little late I guess.
 Right now there are no formal studies proving it but I'm super curious to know as well.
 Did you get the piercing?
 If so, did it help?level 2Original Poster2 points · 5 years agoI didn't get it yet.
 I ended up getting a helix instead, which I love.
 The daith is next, hopefully this month.Continue this thread level 11 point · 5 years agoI've had a migraine for the past three days, and I was just reading about the daith piercing thing as well.
 I'm a big believer in pressure points and acupuncture, so I might give it a try.
 If it doesn't work, I'll just have a cool new piercing :)level 11 point · 5 years agoI have suffered from migraines for a really long time and decided to give it a try.
 Migraines still happen but much less frequently and usually much less intense..
 Even if it is totally placebo effect, the result is less migraines and that was worth the total $100 and minimal (for me) pain of the piercing.level 11 point · 5 years agoAll I found was this but he could be a quack.View Entire Discussion (36 Comments)More posts from the piercing communityContinue browsing in r/piercingr/piercingWelcome to piercing170kMembers1.4kOnlineCreated Nov 14, 2008JoinhelpReddit AppReddit coinsReddit premiumReddit giftsaboutcareerspressadvertiseblogTermsContent policyPrivacy policyMod policyReddit Inc © 2020.

 I'm alkergic to triptans, like Imitrex, and the rest just don't work.
 I've spent weeks in the hospital getting the same tests run over and over by neurologists.
 I think I've had 7 now.
 Maybe 8.
 I don't bother going to the ER anymore cuz I spend hours getting treatments that don't work, and they go thru each drug cocktail trying to make them go away.
 The only things that work for me are morphine, Percocet, and other \"oxy\" based narcotics.
 If it's a \"hydro\" drug, like Vicodin, it flat out does nothing.
 No effects on me whatsoever.
 My current pain dr treats my migraines with Botox and while that helps, I still get multi-day migraines, and now my 14 yr old son is getting them.
 God I hope not like me!
 Since I read the first article about this daith piercing I've been seriously thinking about getting both my ears done as I don't have one side that hurts more than the other.
 Like others before me have said, I'm willing to be a Guinea pig for science and if it doesn't work I have unique piercings!
 I highly recommend finding someone who has experience doing daith piercings, as they are technically hard to do because of their placement...
 I'll be making calls to the shops I've been to for tattoos (my friend who took over my ink and piercings moved away, dammit!)
 and finding out cost and all the info I can get on care for the piercings.
 But I'm definitely going to try it.
 If it doesn't work, it's a cool and unique piercing, like I said.
 Not sure if it was my imagination or wishful thinking but I definitely felt a release of pressure in my head.
 Now I would have my brain pierced if I thought it would stop these damn awful migraines so here's hoping, fingers crossed.
 Can anyone recommend a good place to get this done in London please?
 Today is day 3 of a particularly awful migraine.
 I felt some pressure relief immediately, throughout the past 2 hours the remaining pain has subsided and tapered off.
 My piercer said it doesn't work for everyone and if it doesn't work there's a couple of other piercings that can also be beneficial for migraines.
 What are the other piercings that can work, did your piercer say?
 I get really bad migraines frequently and I was put on medications that don't work.
