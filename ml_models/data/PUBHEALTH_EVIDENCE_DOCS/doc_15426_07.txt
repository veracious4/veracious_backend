As  we discussed, there are no US CENSUS numbers yet for 2014 that would allow us to compare 2013 (last year before ACA marketplace coverage and Medicaid expansion took effect) to 2014 (August-Sept release usually)2.
 NO comprehensive national numbers yet for 2015, so our best info so far is only capturing the change from 2013 to 2014, the FIRST year of ACA expanded private and public insurance.
 But Gallup and Baker surveys offer some high-quality estimates.3.
 Texas’ Baker Institute reportedRecent Baker Institute Reports: Texas adult (18-64) uninsured rate down almost 8 points from 2013:  dropped from 24.6% in 2013 to 16.9% March 2015.
