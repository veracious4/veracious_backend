 We’re 100% independent and we’re here to help artists, makers, and small brands open a store and start making a living doing what they love.
 For artists, by artists   We’re a small, tight-knit team focused on making Big Cartel empowering and easy to use.
 Some of us run our own Big Cartel stores, others are musicians, illustrators, and filmmakers.
 We’ve worked hard to build a company where we do big things.
 We’re here to help you do the same.
