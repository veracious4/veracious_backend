 As medical marijuana sweeps the nation, and more states and cities are legalizing greenery, one product, cannabidiol from Hemp Health Inc., gives you the benefits of medical marijuana without any of the psychoactive effects of the THC chemical.
 And now you can have these benefits in gelato form.
 Introducing Italian gelato and pastry products giant MEC3’s One Love hemp-flavored gelato.
 Cheekily named after Bob Marley, the ice cream product is completely legal in all 50 states because it does not contain any THC: just the hemp plant minus the munchies and paranoid thoughts.
 But the good news is that the ice cream does taste exactly like marijuana.
 Watch out, Ben &amp; Jerry’s, these guys are ahead of the marijuana ice cream game.“Hemp is a simple superfood ingredient to add to your salads, smoothies, yogurts, you name it,” a representative from Hemp Health said.
 “Cannabis is becoming normalized in the United States, and cannabidiol, the medicinal compound in cannabis, is being used to treat cancer, seizures, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, pain, and other illnesses.”RelatedBen &amp; Jerry’s Are Open to Making Marijuana Ice Cream How to Make a Gourmet Meal with Edible MarijuanaChris Christie Wants Edible Marijuana, but Only for Sick Children Colorado Childproofs Marijuana BrowniesCooking With Marijuana: A New Trend?MEC3’s One Love gelato is made with hemp seeds, crisped cocoa beans, and brown sugar, and is now being sold in American stores.
