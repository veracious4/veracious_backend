 The law requires agencies to have adequate recordkeeping controls to ensure “appropriate documentation of the activities of the agency," Baron said.
 Most high-level government officials use approved government networks in daily communications and to conduct official business, with an implicit understanding that these rules exist, Baron said.The 2009 National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Regulations were in place for most of Clinton’s tenure in office, Baron noted, with limited exceptions under which agency employees could use alternative methods to send and receive official electronic messages.Agencies that allow employees to use other methods for electronic mail messaging must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate Federal recordkeeping system, he said.“Up until March 2015, I would have imagined that two aspects of this regulation were clearly understood by every records officer in government.
