L. 98– 4417; in this subsection referred to as the ‘‘1984 5Act’’) was enacted with the intent of facilitating 6the early entry of generic drugs while pre-7serving incentives for innovation. 8(B) Prescription drugs make up 10 percent 9of national health care spending, but for the 10past decade have been one of the fastest grow-11ing segments of health care expenditures. 12(C) Until recently, the 1984 Act was suc-13cessful in facilitating generic competition to the 14benefit of consumers and health care payers— 15although 67 percent of all prescriptions dis-16pensed in the United States are generic drugs, 17they account for only 20 percent of all expendi-18tures. 19(D) In recent years, the intent of the 1984 20Act has been subverted by certain settlement 21agreements between brand companies and their 22potential generic competitors that make reverse 23payments, i.e., payments by the brand company 24to the generic company. 25VerDate Nov 24 2008 12:56 Oct 30, 2009Jkt 089200PO 00000Frm 01520Fmt 6652Sfmt 6201E:\BILLS\H3962.IHH3962
