Bowen Loftin, according to professors, students, state lawmakers and others.
 Both men made a series of enemies among faculty, graduate students and legislators, these people said.
 As students’ discontent over a series of recent racial incidents escalated, they found few ready supporters around campus, they added.
 State Rep. Steve Cookson, chairman of the Higher Education Committee, called for Mr. Wolfe’s resignation in recent days, but said it wasn’t in support of the student protests.
 Instead, he said in a statement that he wanted to “shine a light on ongoing problems at the university.”  Mr. Wolfe, a former software executive who took charge of the 77,000-student university system in early 2012, and Mr. Loftin, who joined in December 2013, faced clashes touching on abortion rights, tea-party politics, academic publishing, graduate-student benefits and their response to race riots 110 miles away in Ferguson, Mo.
 Faculty were skeptical from the start about Mr. Wolfe’s ability to juggle the university’s financial constraints and its academic mission, since he had no experience as a university administrator or professor.
 Some doubters said he proved them right three months into his tenure, when he announced plans to end a roughly $400,000 annual subsidy to the University of Missouri Press.
 That effectively shut the half-century-old institution, which had published such authors as Langston Hughes.
 About 5,000 people signed a petition urging Mr. Wolfe to reconsider.
