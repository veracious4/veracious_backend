Œ Economic Stimulus
  SUBTITLE A 
Œ 2020 RECOVERY REBATE IMPROVEMENTS
 Sec. 20101. Dependents taken into account in determining credit and rebates.
 Makes all dependents eligible for the $500 qualifying child amount 
in the Economic Impact 

Payments made under the CARES Act, previously only applicable to children below age 17. This 
allows households with dependents who are full
-time students below age 24 and adult 
dependents to also receive the $500 amount. This provisi
on is effective retroactive to the date of 
enactment of the CARES Act. 
 Sec. 20102. Individuals providing taxpayer identification numbers taken into account in 

determining credit and rebates.
 Allows Economic Impact Payments to be made to an individual who 
provides a Taxpayer 
Identification Number, rather than a Social Security Number. This provision is effective 
retroactive to the date of enactment of the CARES Act. 
 Sec. 20103. 2020 recovery rebates not subject to reduction or offset with respect to past
-due 
support. 
 Exempts Economic Impact Payments from reduction or offset with respect to past
-due child 
support. 
 Sec. 20104. Protection of 2020 Economic Impact Payments.
 Protects Economic Impact Payments from any form of transfer, assignment, execution, lev
y, 
attachment, garnishment, legal process, bankruptcy or insolvency law, and any other means of 
capture prohibited for payments made under Chapter 7 Subchapter 2 of the Social Security Act. 
 Sec. 20105. Payments to representative payees and fiduciaries.
 Amends the CARES Act to clarify that, for an individual whose Economic Impact Payment was 
paid based on a Social Security Benefit Statement or Social Security Equivalent Benefit 
Statement, any Economic Impact Payment made to a representative payee or fiducia
ry shall only 
be used for the benefit of the person for whom the payment was intended. This provision is 
effective retroactive to the date of enactment of the CARES Act. 
    12  Sec. 20106. Application to taxpayers with respect to whom advance payment has already
 been made.
 When the amendments to the Economic Impact Payments described above increase the amount 

of advance payments a taxpayer is eligible for, Treasury shall issue a rebate equal to the 
taxpayers™ redetermined rebate less the previously issued rebate. 
  SUBTITLE 
B Œ ADDDITIONAL RECOVERY REBATES TO INDIVIDUALS
 Sec. 20111. Additional recovery rebates to individuals.
 Provides a $1,200 refundable tax credit for each family member that shall be paid out in advance 
payments, similar to the Economic Impact Payments in th
e CARES Act. The credit is $1,200 for 
a single taxpayer ($2,400 for joint filers), in addition to $1,200 per dependent up to a maximum 

of 3 dependents. The credit phases out starting at $75,000 of modified adjusted gross income 
($112,500 for head of househ
old filers and $150,000 for joint filers) at a rate of $5 per $100 of 
income. 
 Treasury shall issue this credit as an advance payment based on the information on 2018 or 2019 

tax returns. Treasury shall issue advance payments for Social Security Old
-Age, S
urvivors, and 
Disability Insurance beneficiaries, Supplemental Security Income recipients, Railroad 

Retirement Board beneficiaries, and Veterans Administration beneficiaries who did not file 
returns for 2018 or 2019 based on information provided by the Soc
ial Security Administration, 
the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Veterans Administration. Treasury shall conduct 

outreach to non
-filers to inform them of how to file for their advance payment. 
 Taxpayers receiving an advance payment that exceeds their m
aximum eligible credit based on 
2020 information will not be required to repay any amount of the payment to the Treasury. If the 
credit based on 2020 information exceeds the amount of the advance payment, taxpayers can 

claim the difference on their 2020 ta
x returns.
 The recovery rebate improvements in sections 201 through 205 of this division generally apply 
to these additional rebates. Additionally, Treasury is instructed to make payments to the 
territories that relate to the cost of providing the credits 
for each territory. 
  SUBTITLE C 
Œ EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT
 Sec. 20121. Strengthening the earned income tax credit for individuals with no qualifying 
children for 2020.
 Expands the eligibility and the amount of the earned income tax credit for taxpayers wi
th no 
qualifying children (the ﬁchildless EITCﬂ) for 2020. In particular, the minimum age to claim the 
childless EITC is reduced from 25 to 19 (except for full
-time students) and the upper age limit 
for the childless EITC is increased from age 65 to age 66
. This section also increases childless 
EITC amount by increasing the credit percentage and phaseout percentage from 7.65 to 15.3 
percent, increasing the earned income amount to $9,720, increasing the phaseout amount to 
$11,490. Under these parameters, the
 maximum credit amount in 2020 increases from $538 to 
$1,487. 
    13  Sec. 20122. Taxpayer eligible for childless earned income credit in case of qualifying 
children who fail to meet certain identification requirements.
 Repeals the provision prohibiting an EITC
-eligible taxpayer with qualifying children from taking 
the childless EITC if he or she cannot claim the EITC with respect to qualifying children due to 
failure to meet child identification requirements (including a valid SSN for qualifying children). 
Accord
ingly, individuals who do not claim the EITC with respect to qualifying children due to 
failure to meet identification requirements would now be able claim the childless EITC.
 Sec. 20123. Credit allowed in case of certain separated spouses.
 Allows a marrie
d but separated individual to be treated as not married for purposes of the EITC 
if a joint return is not filed. Thus, the EITC may be claimed by the individual on a separate 
return. This rule only applies if the taxpayer lives with a qualifying child for 
more than one
-half 
of the taxable year and either does not have the same principal place of abode as his or her 

spouse for the last six months of the year, or has a separation decree, instrument, or agreement 
and doesn™t live with his or her spouse by the 
end of the taxable year. This change aligns the 
EITC eligibility requirements with present
-day family law practice.
 Sec. 20124. Elimination of disqualified investment income test.
 Eliminates the disqualified investment income test so that individuals are a
ble to claim the EITC 
without regard to the amount of certain investment income.
 Sec. 20125. Application of earned income tax credit in possessions of the United States.
 Instructs Treasury to make payments to the territories that relate to the cost of each
 territory™s 
EITC. The possessions must provide Treasury with annual reports on the estimate of costs and a 
statement of costs with respect to the preceding year.
 Sec. 20126. Temporary special rule for determining earned income for purposes of earned 
incom
e tax credit.
 Allows taxpayers in 2020, for purposes of computing the EITC, to substitute their 2019 earned 

income for their 2020 earned income if their 2020 earned income is less than their 2019 earned 
income. 
  
SUBTITLE D 
Œ CHILD TAX CREDIT
 Sec. 20131. C
hild tax credit improvements for 2020.

-year
-olds qualifying 
children.  The provision req
uires the Secretary to make best efforts to provide the enhanced

of this Act.
 Sec. 20235. Clarification of treatment of expenses paid or incurred with proceeds from 
certain grants and loans.
 Clarifies that expenses paid or incurred with proceeds from Payment Protection Program loans 

that are forgiven pursuant to 
section 1106(b) of the CARES Act and certain loan forgiveness by 
Small Business Administration, emergency EIDL grants, and certain loan payments that are not

  Title III Œ Net Operating Losses
 Sec. 20301. Limitation on excess businesses losses of non
-corporate taxpayers restored and 
made permanent. 
 Amends changes made by the CARES Act to section 461(l) of the Code, which provides that an 
excess busines
s loss of a taxpayer (other than a corporation) is not allowed for a taxable year. 
Excess business losses are treated as net operating losses in the next succeeding taxable year. An 

excess business loss exists if taxpayer™s total deductions from all trades
 or businesses exceed all 
income from such trades or businesses, plus $250,000 ($500,000 for joint filers). The CARES 

Act suspended this provision for taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Under current 
law (as amended by CARES), this provision a
pplies for taxable years beginning on or after 
January 1, 2021, and beginning before December 31, 2025. This section amends current law to 

apply the provision to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, as was the case before 
CARES passed. In a
ddition, this section makes the provision permanent, and repeals section 
461(j) of the Code as a deadwood provision. This provision is made effective retroactive to the 

date of enactment of the CARES Act.
    19  Sec. 20302. Certain taxpayers allowed carryback of 
net operating losses arising in 2019 and

CARES), taxpayers with a loss in 2018, 2019 or 2020 may apply those losses to the preceding 
five taxable years. This se
ction amends the provisions of CARES that provide for net operating 
loss carrybacks by limiting carrybacks to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. In 
addition, this provision prohibits taxpayers with excessive executive compensation or exce
ssive 
stock buybacks and dividends from carrying back losses. This provision is made effective 
retroactive to the date of enactment of the CARES Act.

Œ Retirement Provisions
 Prepared by the Democratic staff of the House Committee
s on Ways and Means
 and 
Education and Labor
     30  Sec. 100. Short title. 
The short title of the legislation is the Emergency Pension Plan Relief Act 
of 2020 (ﬁEPPRAﬂ).
  Title I Œ Relief for Multiemployer Pension Plans
  Sec. 101. Special Partition Relief. 
About 10 million Americans participate in multiemployer 
pension plans and about 1.3 million of them are in plans that are quickly running out of money. 

Many of these troubled multiemployer plans cover workers who are on the front lines of the 
COVID
-19 public health crisis, such as trucking, food processing, grocery store workers, and 
others. Even before the pandemic, workers, businesses, and retirees faced a crisis and were in 
dire need of our help. With work drying up around the country and the market down
turn, the 
economic catastrophe resulting from COVID
-19 has exacerbated the multiemployer pension 
crisis and threatened the hard
-earned pensions of even more workers and retirees. This threatens 
to bankrupt the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (ﬁPBGCﬂ),
 impose damaging liabilities on 
thousands of businesses, and devastate communities across the country. 
  Under current law, PBGC has limited authority to partition certain troubled multiemployer 
pension plans. In a partition, PBGC takes on the financial re
sponsibility of some of the benefits 
of an eligible plan, so that the plan can stay solvent. EPPRA creates a special partition program 

that would expand PBGC™s existing authority, increase the number of eligible plans, and 
simplify the application process
Šallowing more troubled plans to obtain much
-needed relief.  
 Just like the bipartisan Butch Lewis Act (H.R. 397), eligible plans would include: plans in 

critical and declining status, plans with significant underfunding with more retirees than active 
worke
rs, plans that have suspended benefits, and certain plans that have already become 
insolvent. In contrast, EPPRA allows plans to become eligible for the special partition program 

through 2024. Because the COVID
-19 crisis has already caused significant inve
stment losses to 
pension plan assets and decreased the number of hours worked, plan funding may deteriorate 

over time. Consequently, plans may need to access the special partition relief program in coming 
years. 
  
PBGC is required to issue regulations within 120 days of enactment of this legislation and may 
prioritize the processing of applications of plans most in need. A qualifying plan may apply to 
PBGC and, upon approval, would receive financial assistance. 
Unde
r the special partition 
program, a plan would receive enough financial assistance to keep it solvent and well
-funded for 
thirty years
Šwith no cuts to the earned benefits of participants and beneficiaries. Plans that 
previously cut benefits would have to re
store them to the retirees who earned them. In exchange 
for the financial assistance, each plan would have to comply with certain conditions, and would 

be required to file regular comprehensive reports to PBGC and to the Congressional committees 
of jurisdi
ction. 
  
This legislation also includes important accountability and transparency provisions. PBGC 
would be required to annually report to Congress. The Government Accountability Office 
(ﬁGAOﬂ) would be required to regularly evaluate PBGC™s implementation 
and administration of 
the special partition relief program. PBGC™s Inspector General would receive funding to audit 
the special partition relief program to prevent against waste, fraud, and abuse. PBGC would be 
required to establish and regularly update a 
user
-friendly website so that plan administrators, 
   31  employers, participants, beneficiaries, interested stakeholders, and the public can track the 
implementation and administration of the special partition relief program. Because PBGC 
currently receives no a
ppropriations, the legislation includes additional funding to cover the costs 
of the program. 
  By stabilizing these pensions, the special partition relief program would protect retirees who 
worked for decades to earn their benefits. It would also help bus
inesses avoid crushing liabilities 
and support communities around the country.
  
Sec. 102. Repeal of Benefit Suspensions for Multiemployer Plans in Critical and Declining 
Status. 
Upon date of enactment, no plan would be permitted to apply, or be approved, f
or a 
suspension of benefits under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act (ﬁMPRAﬂ). This restores 
the promise of a secure retirement for millions of workers currently in danger. Going forward, no 
participant or beneficiary in a multiemployer pension plan woul
d suffer a cut to their earned 
benefits under MPRA.
  Sec. 103. Temporary Delay of Designation of Multiemployer Plans as in Endangered, 
Critical, or Critical and Declining Status. 
Under the legislation, a plan could retain its funding 
zone status as of a pl
an year beginning in 2019 for plan years that begin in 2020 or 2021. A plan 
in endangered or critical status would not have to update its plan or schedules until the plan year 
beginning March 1, 2021. This would provide a plan with flexibility and ease an 
administrative 
burden given the economic and financial turmoil resulting from the COVID
-19 public health 
crisis.
  Sec. 104. Temporary Extension of the Funding Improvement and Rehabilitation Periods 
for Multiemployer Pension Plans in Critical and Endangered
 Status for 2020 or 2021. 
Under the bill, a plan in endangered or critical status for a plan year beginning in 2020 or 2021 
could extend its rehabilitation period by five years. This would give a plan additional time to 
improve its contribution rates, limi
t benefit accruals, and maintain plan funding
Šall on its own 
terms. This provision is effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2019.
  Sec. 105. Adjustments to Funding Standard Account Rules. 
Funding shortfalls as a result of 
investment losses 
are generally required to be made up over a period of 15 years. Following the 
financial crisis of 2008, multiemployer plans were allowed to amortize investment losses from 

2008 or 2009 over a period of 30 years. Now, the market downturn resulting from the 
COVID
-19 pandemic is already damaging the funding of multiemployer pension plans. Under the 

legislation, for investment losses in plan years beginning in 2019 and 2020, a plan could use a 
30-year amortization base to spread out losses over time. Pension pl
ans, participants, and plan 
sponsors need more stability and a longer period over which to pay for long
-term liabilities that 
can stretch out for decades. This would help a plan weather this economic and financial storm. 
This provision is effective for pla
n years ending on or after February 29, 2020.
  Sec. 106. PBGC Guarantee for Participants in Multiemployer Plans. 
PBGC provides a 

maximum guaranteed benefit of $12,870 to a participant in a multiemployer plan, if that 
participant had 30 years of service. Th
e guarantee is 100% of the first $11 of the monthly benefit 
rate, plus 75% of the next $33 of the monthly benefit rate, multiplied by the participant's years of 
   32  credited service. This legislation would double the guarantee to 100% of the first $15 in month
ly 
benefits per year of service and 75% of the next $70 in monthly benefits per year of service, and 
indexes it thereafter. This would help participants and beneficiaries receive more of the benefits 
they earned through their hard work and service. All pla
ns receiving financial assistance 
beginning December 16, 2014, would see the improved guarantee take effect. A plan that 

becomes insolvent in the future would be subject to the increased guarantee in the calendar year 
in which it becomes insolvent. 
   Title II Œ Relief for Single Employer Pension Plans
  Sec. 201. Extended Amortization for Single Employer Plans. 
In light of an ongoing pattern of 
interest rate and market volatility due to the COVID
-19 public health crisis, the current law 
requirement to amort
ize funding shortfalls over seven years is no longer appropriate. Pension 
plans, participants, and plan sponsors need more stability and a longer period over which to pay 
for long
-term liabilities that can stretch out for more than 50 years. Accordingly, u
nder the bill, 
the following rules would apply to all single employer pension plans, effective for plan years 
beginning after December 31, 2019: 
 All shortfall amortization bases for all plan years beginning before January 1, 2020 (and all 

shortfall 
amortization installments determined with respect to such bases) would be reduced to 
zero.
 All shortfalls would be amortized over 15 years, rather than seven years. 
  Sec. 202. Extension of Pension Funding Stabilization Percentages for Single Employer 
Plan
s. 
In 2012, 2014, and 2015, Congress provided for pension interest rate smoothing in order 
to address concerns that historically low interest rates were creating inflated pension funding 
obligations, diverting corporate assets away from jobs and business reco
very. Under interest rate 
smoothing, the interest rates used to value pension liabilities must be within 10% of 25
-year 
interest rate averages. The smoothed interest rates would begin phasing out in 2021, with the 
10% corridor around the 25
-year interest r
ate averages increasing five percentage points each 
year until interest rates need only be within 30% of the 25
-year averages. Because of this phase
-out, smoothing would soon cease to have much effect. In order to preserve the stabilizing effects 
of smooth
ing: 
 The 10% interest rate corridor would be reduced to 5%, effective in 2020. 
 
The phase
-out of the 5% corridor would be delayed until 2026, at which point the corridor 
would, as under current law, increase by 5 percentage points each year until it attai
ns 30% in 
2030, where it would stay.
 A 5% floor would be put on the 25
-year interest rate averages. This floor would establish 
stability and predictability on a longer
-term basis, so that interest rate variations do not create 
excessive volatility. In addi
tion, this floor would protect funding rules from the extremes of 
interest rate movements. 
 This provision is effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2019.
    Title III Œ Other Retirement Related Provisions
  Sec. 301. Waiver of Required Minim
um Distributions for 2019. 
Under current law, generally 
at the age of 72, individuals must take a required minimum distribution (ﬁRMDﬂ) from their 
   33  defined contribution plans and IRAs. Due to the market downturn resulting from the COVID
-19 pandemic, the bal
ances in these accounts have sharply decreased 
Œ in many instances, the market 
has reduced taxpayers™ accounts more than what their RMD would have been. Therefore, the 
recently enacted CARES Act waived RMDs for 2020, allowing individuals to keep funds in t
heir 
retirement plans. This provision expands this relief further by providing that 
2019 RMDs would 

be waived for defined contribution plans and IRAs. 
  Sec. 302. Waiver of 60
-Day Rule in case of Rollover of Otherwise Required Minimum 
Distributions in 2019
 and 2020. 
This provision further expands the 2020 RMD relief in the 
CARES Act by providing that:
  The RMDs made for 2019 would be permitted to be rolled back to a plan or IRA without 
regard to the 60
-day requirement if the rollover is made by November 30, 
2020.
  RMDs made for 2020 would be permitted to be rolled back to a plan or IRA without 
regard to the 60
-day requirement if the rollover is made by November 30, 2020. 
  Sec. 303. Employee Certification as to Eligibility for Increased CARES Act Loan Limits 
from Employer Plan. 
The CARES Act permits eligible retirement plans to rely on an 
employee™s certification that the employee qualifies to receive a coronavirus
-related distribution. 
Technically, it appears that a plan cannot rely on such a certification for
 purposes of determining 
whether an employee is eligible for the special loan rules. In past disaster relief, the IRS has 
generally permitted reliance on reasonable representations by an employee in a similar context, 
absent actual knowledge to the contrar
y. But in the past, the statute has not had a specific 
employee certification provision that applies for distributions but not loans. This provision 

provides a statutory clarification. 
  
Sec. 304. Exclusion of Benefits Provided to Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Medical 

Responders Made Permanent. 
Almost 70 percent of firefighters and emergency medical 

services (ﬁEMSﬂ) personnel are volunteers, 71 percent of fire departments are exclus
ively staffed 
by volunteers, and 91 percent of all US fire department use volunteer firefighters and EMTs to 

some degree. Therefore, at the end of last year, the
 SECURE Act
 reinstated
 for 
one
 year
 the 
exclusions for
 qualified
 State
 or 
local
 tax
 benefits
 and
 qualified
 reimbursement
 payments
 provided to 
members
 of 
qualified
 volunteer emergency 
response
 organizations
 and
 increases
 the 
exclusion
 for
 qualified
 reimbursement 
payments
 to $50 for
 each month 
during
 which a
 volunteer
 performs 
services. This 
would 
allow volunteer fire and EMS personnel for 2020 to receive 
nominal recruitment and retention incentives without those incentives being considered as 

taxable income
.   
The COVID
-19 pandemic places an enormous amount of strain on these volunteer personnel as
 they are exposing themselves to COVID
-19 and are responding to a much higher than normal 
call volume. Therefore, the provision would make permanent these amendments to Code Section 
139B.
  
Sec. 305. Application of Special Rules to Money Purchase Pension Pl
ans. 
The CARES Act 
provided for early distribution and loan relief for retirement plans during the coronavirus relief 

period. While this relief was intended to apply to all qualified retirement plans, there were 
   34  questions as to whether it would apply to mo
ney purchase pension plans (ﬁMPPPﬂ). MPPPs are a 
type of defined
-contribution retirement plan offered by some employers. This provision would 
clarify that MPPPs would benefit from the legislation.
  Sec. 306. Grants to Assist Low
-Income Women and Survivors 
of Domestic Violence in 
Obtaining Qualified Domestic Relations Orders. 
Certain states under stay
-at-home orders 
have seen domestic violence rates rise as much as 30 percent since the beginning of the COVID
-19 pandemic. 
This provision directs the Secretary 
of Labor, acting through the Director of the 
Women™s Bureau in conjunction with the Assistant Secretary of the Employee Benefits Security 
Administration, to award grants of at least $250,000 to established community
-based 
organizations on a competitive bas
is to assist low
-income women and survivors of domestic 
violence in obtaining qualified domestic relations orders to ensure that these women actually 
obtain the benefits to which they are entitled through those orders. 
  Sec. 307. Modification of Special R
ules for Minimum Funding Standards for Community 
Newspaper Plans. 
Community newspapers are generally family
-owned, non
-publicly traded, 
independent newspapers. The recently enacted SECURE Act provided pension funding relief for 
a number of community newspa
per plan sponsors by increasing the interest rate to calculate 
those funding obligations to 8%. Additionally, the SECURE Act provided for a longer 

amortization period of 30 years from 7 years. These two changes enable struggling community 
newspapers to str
etch out their required pension plan contributions over a longer time period. 
 The legislation would expand the SECURE Act relief to additional community newspapers.
  Sec. 308. Minimum Rate of Interest for Certain Determinations Related to Life Insurance 

Contracts. 
In order to qualify as life insurance contracts for tax purposes, permanent life 
insurance policies must meet several requirements under Internal Revenue Cod
e section 
7702. These requirements include two interest rate assumptions for determining the premiums 
that can be used to fund the contracts.
 The interest rate assumptions were set by statute at 4 
percent and 6 percent when the requirements were put in pla
ce in 1984.
 At the time, the average 
long
-term Treasury rate was around 12 percent.
 The recent public health and economic crisis has 
prompted the Federal Reserve to reduce already persistently low interest rates to around 0 

percent, and the daily long
-term
 Treasury rate has hovered at 1 percent.
 Without adjusting the 
section 7702 interest rates to reflect economic realities, consumer access to financial security via 

permanent life insurance policies
Šwhich represent approximately 60 percent of the individual
 life insurance market
Šcould decrease significantly.
 This legislation updates section 7702 to 
reflect the interest rate environment that has been exacerbated by the current crisis, and ensures 
that the rates will continue to appropriately reflect economic 
conditions, by tying the rates to 
either a floating rate prescribed in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners™ 
Standard Valuation Law or a floating rate based on the average applicable Federal mid
-term rates 
over a 60
-month period.
  DIVISION E
 Œ Continued 
Assistance to Unemployed Workers
 Prepared by the Democratic staff of the House Committee on Ways and Means
  Sec. 101. Extension of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC). 
     35  Subsection (a).
 This subsection would extend the $600 per 
week FPUC supplement to state and federal 
unemployment benefits through January 31, 2021. It would also add a transition rule (sometimes 
called a ﬁsoft cutoffﬂ) to allow individuals already receiving regular state unemployment benefits 
on January 31 to con
tinue receiving the FPUC supplement until the end of the period of benefits 
to which they are entitled so long as they would end by March 31, 2021.
  
Subsection (b).
 This subsection would require federal programs and state and local programs which receive a
ny 
federal funding to disregard FPUC payments when calculating income for the purposes of 

determining eligibility for benefits or assistance, and to exclude it from resource limits for 9 
months following receipt.
   Sec. 102. Extension and benefit phaseout 
rule for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. 

This section would extend  Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits (PUA) provided to 

workers who do not qualify for regular unemployment compensation through January 31, 2021.

by March 31, 2021.
  Sec. 103.
 Extension and benefit phaseout rule for Pandemic Extended Unemployment 
Compensation. 
This section would extend Pandemic Extended Unemployment Compensation 
(PEUC), which provides 13 additional weeks of unemployment benefits to individuals who have 
exhausted
 other benefits, through January 31, 2021. Workers would be able to apply for PEUC

unemployment compensation th
rough January 31, 2021.
  Sec. 105.
 Extension of emergency relief and technical corrections for governmental entities 
and nonprofit organizations.
 This section would extend the financial relief provided to 
reimbursable employers in the CARES Act through Jan
uary 31, 2021, and make technical 
corrections to ensure that states can simply waive 50 percent of the amount owed by such 
employers.
  Sec. 106. Reduction of state administrative burden in determination of amount of 
Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA). 
This clarifies state flexibility to use the most 
readily available sources of income verification for PUA applicants, including data from the 
mobile apps used by many gig workers.
  
Sec. 107. Extension of temporary assistance to states with advances.
 The Fa
milies First 
Coronavirus Response Act provided states with interest
-free loans through December 31, 2020. 
This provision extends that duration through June 30, 2021.
    36   Sec. 108. Extension of full federal funding of extended unemployment compensation. 
The 
Families First Coronavirus Response Act increased federal reimbursement for extended 
unemployment compensation (EB) from 50 percent to 100 percent for benefits provided through 

December 31, 2020. This section extends the 100 percent reimbursement to cover be
nefits paid 
through June 30, 2021.
  
Sec. 109. Extension of temporary financing of Short
-Time Compensation payments to 
states with programs in law. 
This section would extend the period in which payments under 
short
-time compensation programs  in
 state law were 100 percent federally reimbursable through 
January 31, 2021.
  Sec. 110. Extension of temporary financing of Short
-Time Compensation payments. 
This 
section would extend the 50 percent reimbursement for Short
-Time Compensation payments not 
made under a state law through January 31, 2021.
  
Sec. 111. Grace period for full financing of new short
-time compensation programs. 
This 
provision ensures that any states that enacts a short
-time compensation (STC) law will receive 
full federal financing fo
r all agreements in place after March 29, even if agreement began before 
a new state STC law became effective.

  Title I Œ Family Care for Essential Workers
 Sec. 100101. Family Care for Essential Workers
. Subsection (a). Increase in Funding.
 This section increases the overall authorization level for the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) 
to $12.15 billion in 2020 and directly appropriates $850 million to SSBG to fund child and 

family care for essential wo
rkers.
 Subsection (b). Rules Governing Use of Additional Funds.
 This section specifies that states can only use the $850 million appropriated in this section to 

provide care for members of the households of essential workers that are incapable of 
self
-care, 
including children and adult family members who require daytime care.
 The section gives states several options for providing care, including reimbursing workers 

directly for care they obtain themselves, paying child care and adult care providers
, and setting 
up emergency child care. It specifies that there is no income test for receiving this emergency 
   46  child care help, and waives some existing SSBG funding restrictions that prevent states from 
working directly with health care facilities or other
wise providing these services. 
 In cases where the state works with child care providers or sets up child care facilities, they 

would be required to follow state and local licensing laws unless the state determined that a 
specific requirement would prevent
 them from providing the services, in which case they are 
required to report specifically to the Secretary on the requirement and why it is an impediment.
 The section specifies that states cannot supplant state funding used for child care with these new 
federal dollars, or exclude essential workers by requiring a means test for services.
 Finally, the section defines ﬁessential workerﬂ to include:
  Health care sector workers
  Emergency response workers
  Sanitation workers
  Workers at businesses which state or lo
cal officials have determined must stay open to 
serve the public during the COVID
-19 emergency

Emergency Aid and Services. 
 Subsection (a). Funding for States.
 This subsection directly appropriates $9.6 billion to the Social Services Block Grant for 
the sole 
purpose of providing emergency aid and services to disadvantaged children, families, and 
households. It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to distribute the funds to 

all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. Territori
es within 45 days, and requires states 

and territories to obligate the funds by December 31, 2020. 
 Under this section, states would be required to pass through at least 50 percent of the funds to 

county governments, local governments working in partnershi
p with community
-based 
organizations, or directly to community
-based organizations with experience serving 
disadvantaged individuals or families. States are required to distribute the funds expeditiously, 

ensure that the pass
-through funds are distributed 
to sub
-state areas based on the area™s share of 
disadvantaged individuals, and report to HHS on their plan for distribution within 90 days.
 The funds could be used to provide basic economic and well
-being necessities, provide necessary 
supplies to protect 
against infection, help connect individuals and families to payments and 

services for which they are eligible, provide short
-term cash, non
-cash, or in
-kind disaster relief, 
   47  and pay operational costs directly related to providing the services and maintaini
ng local social 
service operations to assist needy families. 
 This section also prohibits imposition of burdensome individual eligibility determinations for 
emergency assistance and waives section 2005(a)(2) and 2005(a)(8) of the Social Security Act to 
allow emergency payments.
 Finally, it prohibits states from using any of the funds to supplant existing state spending or to 
pay for services which would be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 Subsection (b). Funding for Federally Recogn
ized Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations.
 This subsection provides $400 million to federally recognized Indian Tribes and Tribal 

organizations to fund emergency aid and services for disadvantaged individuals and families. 

Funds would be distributed on t
he basis of population and could not be used for services that 
would be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 Sec. 100202. Emergency Assistance to Older Foster Youth.
 Subsection (a). Funding Increases.
 This section increases fiscal year 20
20 funding for the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence 
Program, which serves older youth who were in foster care at age 14, by $50 million for 2020. It 

also increases authorized funding for the specific program that provides Education and Training 

Vouc
hers (ETV) to these youth by 30 percent, and provides flexibility to better serve youth.
 Subsection (b). Programmatic Flexibility.
 This section provides states with various temporary flexibilities needed to serve vulnerable older 

foster youth during the CO
VID
-19 pandemic. Those include:
  Eliminating the age limit on receiving Chafee
-funded services, so states can serve more 
former foster youth in need
  Suspending work and educational progress requirements for older youth receiving 
assistance due to current or
 past foster care during the time period in which they may be 
impossible to comply with
  Giving states authority to waive limits on providing housing assistance to older youth, 
who may have lost their current housing due to university and other closings
    Waiving educational progress and employment requirements for older foster youth who 
are unable to work or go to school during the pandemic
 All flexibilities expire January 31, 2021.
 Sec. 100203. Emergency Assistance to Families Through Home Visiting Programs
. This section temporarily allows home visiting programs funded under the Maternal, Infant, and 

Early Childhood Home Visiting program (MIECHV) to 
  Conduct virtual home visits, when needed to comply with public health directives
    48  o Help families acquire needed
 technology to participate in virtual home visits
 o Train home visitors in conducting virtual home visits
  Train home visitors to assist families with emergency preparedness and response
  Provide emergency supplies to families, such as diapers, formula, non
-perishable food, 
water, soap, and hand sanitizer.
  Provide prepaid debit cards to families to help meet emergency needs.
 The section also provides an additional $100 million for home visiting in 2020, and
 allows HHS 
to extend contracts and delay reporting deadlines as is reasonable during the COVID
-19 pandemic.
 The flexibilities end January 31, 2021.
 Title III Œ Program Flexibility During the Pandemic
 Sec. 100301. Emergency Flexibility for Child Welfare Pr
ograms.
 This section provides state child welfare programs with flexibility to provide services, including 
caseworker visits, virtually when necessary to comply with public health directives.
 Sec. 100302. Emergency Flexibility for Child Support Programs.
 This section provides states with the option to suspend penalties for non
-custodial parents for 
inability to pay child support during the COVID
-19 pandemic, since some courts have suspended 
non
-emergency proceedings, including those related to modifying chi
ld support orders. It also 
suspends federal requirements to penalize custodial parents (via TANF) and non
-custodial 
parents (via Child Support Enforcement) for failure to comply with paternity establishment rules, 

since paternity establishment requires in
-person action which may not be possible during the 
pandemic. In some states, using this flexibility may require a change in state law.
 The section does not change that the state™s duty to make all reasonable efforts to deliver child 

support funds to custod
ial parents, but does suspend financial penalties and generally holds states 

financially harmless for failure to meet strict targets and state plan and operational requirements 

during the pandemic. The flexibility means states can continue to receive feder
al child support 
incentive payments even if they fall below the 90 percent paternity establishment threshold.
 The section also allows the Secretary of HHS to, wherever possible, provide tribal child support 

programs with the same flexibilities as those aff
orded to state programs. 
 The flexibilities expire January 31, 2021.
 Sec. 100303. Emergency Flexibility for TANF Programs.
 In order to allow compliance with social distancing, shelter
-in-place, and other public health 
guidance, this section suspends the fe
deral work participation rate requirements and the federal 
time limit for the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program during the 

COVID
-19 emergency, and creates penalties for any state or Tribal TANF program that fails to 
ﬁstop the c
lockﬂ on federal time limits for families, and/or that sanctions families for failure to

  DIVISION 
N Œ Giving Retirement Options to Workers Act
 Prepared by the Democratic staff of the House Committee on 
Education
 and Labor
  Sec.___0001. Short Title: 
This division may be cited as the ﬁCOVID
-19 Protections under 
the Longshore and Harbor Workers™ Compensation Act.ﬂ
  Sec.___0002. Composite Plans
 The section changes the multiemployer pension system by authorizing what is referred to as a 

ﬁcomposite plan.ﬂ
  This new plan is composed of features of a traditional defined benefit plan 
and of a 401(k)
-style defined contribution plan.  
  A composite plan may be a stand
-alone plan or a part of an existing multiemployer plan as long 
as such plan is not in critical status or anticipated to be in critical status in the next five years.  

An eligible existing plan (referred to as a ﬁlegacy planﬂ
) that establishes a composite plan must 
satisfy certain requirements for funding the composite plan.  Whether it is a stand
-alone plan or 
part of an existing multiemployer plan, a composite plan must be professionally managed and 
must maintain a projected
 funding ratio of 120 percent on a 15
-year going forward basis.  If the 
amount of plan assets is not enough to pay 120 percent of participants™ promised benefits, the 

plan would have to take remedial action by adopting what is referred to as a ﬁrealignment
 program.ﬂ  The realignment program consists of several tiers of options to be undertaken by the 

plan to enable it to achieve a 120 percent funding ratio.  The first options include increasing 
contribution rates (negotiated by the bargaining parties), redu
cing future accrual rates, and 
reducing adjustable benefits for non
-retirees.  If necessary, the last option is reducing retiree 
benefits.  Consequently, a participant™s benefit may increase or decrease depending on the 
funding level of the composite plan.
  Ensuring that a composite plan maintains a 120 percent 
funding target is viewed as beneficial and could help mitigate against the kind of volatility in the 

financial markets that has occurred during the COVID
-19 public health crisis. 
  
There are requirem
ents to provide annual notices to composite plan participants.  Composite 
plans do not pay PBGC premiums and are not covered by the PBGC guarantee.  If a composite 

plan were to become insolvent, it could not obtain financial assistance from PBGC, and its 
participants and beneficiaries would not be covered by the PBGC guarantee.  Those employers 
who contribute to a composite plan negotiate a fixed contribution rate and do not have 
withdrawal liability, which is a payment or series of payments by an employer 
that no longer 
participates in a multiemployer plan.  A legacy plan that establishes a composite plan, however, 
must continue to pay PBGC premiums and comply with existing funding rules, among other 
   63  requirements.  Participants and beneficiaries in a legacy
 plan continue to be covered by PBGC 
and their benefits would be covered by the PBGC guarantee.

  Sec. 150101. Definitions.
 This section 
provides definitions 
for terms such as ﬁaward yearﬂ, ﬁauthorizing committeesﬂ, and 
ﬁFAFSAﬂ, which stands for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
  
Subtitle A 
Œ CARES Act Amendments
  
Sec. 
150102. Application of Waiver to Participating Nonprofit Employers.
 This section clarifies that the Secretary will waive the non
-federal match requirement for non
-profit employers for award years 2019
-2020 and 2020
-2021. 
  
Sec. 150103. Extension of Federal
 Work
-Study During a Qualifying Emergency.
 This section extends flexibility into the fall that allows institutions of higher education 
(institutions) to pay federal work
-study students even if they are unable to complete their jobs 
due to COVID
-19. 
  Sec. 
150104. Continuing Education at Affected Foreign Institutions. 
 This section clarifies 
that a foreign institution is eligible to offer courses via distance education 
based on a declaration of an emergency in the applicable country rather than the qualifyin
g emergency in the United States. Further, it allows foreign institutions to enter into agreements 

with US based institutions for the duration of the emergency in the applicable country as well as 
in the United States. 
  Sec. 150105
. Funding for 
HBCU Capit
al Financing.
 This section replaces the $62 million cap on mandatory funding provided for the Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Capital Financing program with ﬁsuch sums.ﬂ
  Sec. 150106. Waiver Authority for Institutional Aid
 This section repeals a provision in the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
 (CARES Act) that allows the Secretary of Education to waive the special allotment rule for 
HBCUs with direct HEA appropriations.
  
Sec. 150107. Scope of Modifications
 to Required and Allowable Uses.
 This section
 clarifies 
that the Department of Education cannot 
use the authority provided under 
the CARES Act to grant 
waivers that would allow grant funds to be used in a way that deviates 
from the overall purpose of 
the 
grant program. 
This section additionally allows the Secretary of 
Education to grant waivers related to the required and allowable uses for the Minority Science 

and Engineering Improvement Program. 
     64  Subtitle B 
Œ Financial Aid Access
  Sec. 150108. Emergency
 Financial Aid Grants Excluded from Need Analysis.
 This section specifies that emergency financial aid grants shall not be included as income or 

assets for the purposes of calculating a student™s expected family contribution (EFC) or treated as 
estimated f
inancial assistance not received under Title IV of the 
Higher Education Act of 1965
 (HEA). As a result, emergency 
financial aid provided to 
a student
 in response to 
the 
COVID
-19 emergency will not impact that student™s eligibility for federal financial aid
.   
The term ﬁemergency financial aid grantﬂ includes emergency aid awarded under the Higher 
Education Emergency Relief Fund of the 
CARES Act
, emergency aid supported with 
Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant
 (SEOG) program funds, and any other emerg
ency 
aid provided by a Federal agency, state, Indian tribe, institution, or scholarship
-granting 
organization for the purpose of providing relief in response to a qualifying emergency. 
  
Sec. 150109. Facilitating Access to Financial Aid for Recently Unempl
oyed Students. 
 This section specifies that any individual who has applied for, or is receiving, unemployment 
benefits at the time that they submit an application for federal financial aid will be treated as a 
dislocated worker on the FAFSA, which can qual
ify a FAFSA applicant for the simplified needs 
test or an automatic zero EFC. This provision
 is effective 
for the duration of the COVID
-19 emergency and the following award year
. The Department of Education is required to implement 
this provision within 30
 days of enactment.
  This section 
also require
s the Department of Education to work with the Department of Labor 
and institutions to provide guidance and conduct outreach to recently unemployed individuals 
informing them of their potential eligibility for 
aid, including 
their treatment as dislocated 
workers 
on the FAFSA.
 The Department of Education is additionally required to work with 
institutions to inform applicants for federal student aid of the availability of other means
-tested 
federal benefit program
s and to inform institutions of their authority to share information from a 
student™s FAFSA (with the student™s consent) with
 organization
s that assist students 
in applying 
for and receiving Federal, State, local, or tribal assistance
.   
This section speci
fies that guidance released by the Department of Education on May 8, 2009, 
shall be effective for the 
duration of the COVID
-19 emergency and the following award year
, including guidance regarding the ability of financial aid administrators to conduct profe
ssional 
judgement for recently unemployed students and adjustments to the Department of Education™s 

risk
-based model for selecting institutions for program reviews. 
  
Sec. 150110
. Student Eligibility for Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund
 This section 
prohibits the Secretary of Education from imposing restrictions on the populations 
of students who may receive funds under section 18004 of the CARES Act, which creates the 
Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. This section specifies that the Personal Re
sponsibility 
and 
Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996
 does not apply to funds made available under 
section 18004 of the CARES Act.
  
Sec. 150111. Definition of Distance Education.
    65  This section applies the definition of distance education that was inc
luded in the Department of 
Education™s proposed rule on Distance Education and Innovation published on April 2, 2020 that 
was reached by consensus, to programs that begin on or after August 15, 2020. Distance 
education is defined as 
education that uses tec
hnology
 to deliver instruction to students who are 
separated from the instructor
(s) and
 to support regular and substantive
 interaction between the 
students and the instructor
(s), either synchronously or
 asynchronously.
 This provision is 
effective until the end of the 2020
-2021 award year.
  Sec. 150112. Institutional Stabilization Program.
 This section creates the Institutional Stabilization Program (ISP) which allows eligible 
institutions, in lieu of submitting a letter
 of credit to be considered financially responsible in 
order to participate in title IV, to enter into a COVID
-19 provisional program participation 
agreement (CVPPPA) after meeting certain requirements. 
  
To participate in the ISP, a non
-profit institution
, that offered on campus classes during award 
year 2018
-2019, must have a composite score below 1.0 and a liquidity level of 180 days or 
below. An institution that does not currently have a composite score below 1.0 but estimates that 
it will have a compos
ite score below 1.0 for the following year can also opt into the program if it 
meets the liquidity threshold. Institutions with a liquidity level above 180 days are not eligible to 

participate. 
  
An eligible institution must submit an application to the Se
cretary of Education no later than 
December 31, 2020 and include in the application: an estimated liquidity level; assurance that the 

institution will submit a record management plan and teach
-out plan; and an assurance that the 
institution will meet the r
equirements of the teach
-out agreement if applicable. 
Eligible 
institutions that want to opt into the ISP have 
10 days to notify the institutional state authorizer 
and accreditor of such application and 
60 days to procure an auditor attestation of its liqu
idity 
level (calculated under the FASB ASU 2016
-14) and submit 
a teach
-out plan and record 
management plan as approved by the Department of Education and the institution™s accredito
r. If 
the institution closes, it must release all financial holds placed on
 student records and provide 
access to transcripts at no cost for three years after the institution closes. 
Institutions with 90 
days or less in liquidity must 
meet 
additional requirements after the application is approved. 
While applications are pending, 
the Secretary
 of Education
 cannot collect a letter of credit. 
The 
Secretary of Education is required to approve or deny complete applications within 10 days of 
receiving them and institutions must notify the state authorizer and accreditor within 5 days of
 such decision. 
 
 All institutions must also meet other eligibility requirements regarding administrative capability 
and cash reserve requirements under the 
HEA
. The
 institution w
ill be required to meet the teach
-out plan or agreement requirement based on 
the liquidity level verified by the auditor 
Œ not the 
institution™s estimate in the initial application. Once the institution is in the program, changes in 
liquidity level will no longer impact eligibility or treatment under the program, until it is up for
 renewal.
 However, if there is a consistent decline in liquidity, the Secretary may require an 
institution to make substantial progress on a teach
-out agreement. 
     66  After an institution has met the above requirements, the institution is now approved to ente
r the 
ISP under a COVID
-19 Provisional Program Participation Agreement (CVPPPA). Institutions 
with 90 days or less in liquidity
 must additionally
 make su
fficient 
progress on the teach
-out 
agreement (requiring that a minimum of 75% of students are covered) 
within 30 days of being 
approved for the CVPPPA
 and
 must submit updates on subsequent progress
 every 14 days as 
determined by its accreditor thereafter until the teach
-out agreement(s) covers all students. 
All 
participating institutions must also report re
gularly (i.e. every 15 days for those with 90 days or 
below in liquidity and every 30 days for those with 91
-180 days in liquidity) to the Secretary of 
Education regarding liquidity and student enrollment. 
If these requirements are not met, the 
institution
 is no longer eligible for the CVPPPA and the Secretary can collect a letter of credit.  
  
The CVPPPA may be renewed through June 30, 2022, and if the Secretary of Education 
determines that it is in the benefit of the institution to extend such participati
on, the agreements 
may be renewed through June 30, 2024. 
The Secretary of Education must also submit reports to 

Congress with a summary of each agreement 90 days after enactment and every 90 days 
thereafter until all agreements have expired or been termina
ted. 
  
If a student attending an institution participating in a CVPPPA at the time of closure, and 120 
days prior, is entitled to an automatic closed school discharge if such student has not re
-enrollment in a new institution within three years of such clo
sure. 
  
This section also defines ﬁliquidity levelﬂ, ﬁteach
-out agreementﬂ, ﬁteach
-out institutionﬂ, and 
ﬁteach
-out planﬂ. 
  The Secretary is authorized $300 million to provide grants to participating institutions that meet 
the CVPPPA requirements

I and part E of Title VIII of the 
Public Health 
Service Act
 that are eligible for consolidation with Direct Loans under the HEA. 
  Sec. 150114. Extending the Length of Borrower Relief due to the Coronavirus Emergency.
 This section amends the CARES Act to e
xtend suspension of payments for Federal student loans 
through September 30, 2021 and adds a 30
-day transition period where any missed payments 
after payment suspension ends do not result in collection fees and are not reported to consumer 

reporting agenci
es. Adds a provision that requires the Secretary or, as applicable, the HHS 
Secretary to make the borrowers with loans that were excluded from the CARES Act (i.e., 

commercially
-held FFEL, institutionally
-held Perkins loans, and HHS student loans) whole as 
if 
   67  those loans were part of the original CARES Act. Allows borrowers repaying under an income
-driven repayment plan to not recertify their income or family size until after December 30, 2021.
  Sec. 150115. No Interest Accrual. 
 This section amends the CARE
S Act to e
xtend no interest accrual 
on F
ederal student loans
 (regardless of repayment status) 
until September 30, 2021 or until the economy shows initial 
signs of recovery 
(as 
defined in the Act)
, whichever is longer. 
For commercially
-held
 FFEL and 
institutionally
-held Perkins loans, the Secretary is required to pay the amount of interest due on 
the unpaid principal to the holder on a monthly basis. The payments cannot affect payment 
calculations under the special allowance rules in the HEA
. The HHS Secretary must also pay the 
amount of interest due on the unpaid principal to the holder of the loan on a monthly basis. Adds 

a provision that requires the Secretary or, as applicable, the HHS Secretary to make the 
borrowers with loans that were 
excluded from the CARES Act (i.e., commercially
-held FFEL, 
institutionally
-held Perkins loans, and HHS student loans) whole as if those loans were part of 
the original CARES Act. 
  
Clarifies that accrued interest prior to 
March 13, 2020 can
not 
be 
capitalized as a consequence of 
the implementation of pause payments or the 
no 
interest accrual provisions.
  Sec. 150116. Notice to Borrowers.
 This section makes conforming amendments to the CARES Act such as requiring the HHS 

Secretary to notify HHS borro
wers that the benefits provided to them under the CARES Act, as 
amended in this Act will end. Also requires the Secretary of Education and, as applicable, the 

HHS Secretary to notify Perkins loan and HHS borrowers of income
-driven repayment plans 
available
 to them if they consolidate. 
  Sec. 150117. Writing Down Balances for Federal Student Loan Borrowers. 
 This section amends the CARES Act to 
provide $10,000 of up
-front debt relief for all 
Department of Education loan borrowers. 
Borrowers owing less than $
10,000 will receive up to 
the amount owed on their balance. Unless otherwise requested by the borrower, the discharge is 
applied first toward the loan with the highest interest rate. Borrowers with the same interest rate 
on all loans, the discharge is appl
ied first toward the loan with the highest principal balance. The 
discharged amount is excluded from gross income and not required to be reported to the Internal 

Revenue Services.
  
Sec. 150118. Implementation. 
 This section amends the CARES Act to facilita
te implementation of the temporary relief 

provided to borrowers. Requires holders of commercially
-held FFEL, institutionally
-held Perkins 
loans, and HHS loans to report information that allows the Secretary of Education and, as 

applicable, the HHS Secretar
y to verify borrower payments that are to be provided or suspended 
and calculate the amount of interest due to the holder for reimbursement. 
  Sec. 150119. Effective Date.

between
 the 
date of 
enactment and September 30, 2021 or 
until the economy shows initial signs of recovery (
as 
defined in this Act
), 
whichever is longer. The special rule 
allows borrowers 
to consolidate 
without 
losing prior payments for purposes of Public Service 
Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and 
income
-driven repayment plans.
 To determine the number of monthly qualifying payments, the 
Secretary of Education must calculate the weighted factor of each component loan, determine the 
number of qualifying monthly payments mad
e on each component loan before consolidation, add 
the number of qualifying monthly payments on each loan, and round to the nearest whole 
number. When determining the new interest rate, the standard rules for consolidation apply 
except that the Secretary m
ust not round up the weighted average of the interest rate. The 
Secretary of Education and the HHS Secretary must undertake a campaign to alert borrowers on 

the benefits of consolidating.
  
This section also requires the Government Accountability Office to 
submit a report within six 
months after the date of enactment of this Act on the implementation of this section. 
  Sec. 150121. Treatment of PSLF. 
 
This section removes the requirement that a borrower must be employed in a public service 

employer at the 
time of forgiveness under PSLF. This section also allows a borrower with a full

 of Education. Under this section, bor
rowers covered under these findings who have 
already received partial relief are entitled to the rest of relief on their loans. 
  Not later than 30 days after enactment, the Secretary
 of Education
 must notify each eligible 
borrower 
with information about
