 3  Attitudes

  Participants were asked to rate their level of agreement or disagreement with a set of statements about rape and 
sexual 
assault.
  
 Virtually all respondents (98% of female respondents, 96% of male respondents) agree or strongly agree 

that it is important to get consent before sexual activity.

agree or strongly 
agree that they 
feel confident in their ability to judge if a person is too intoxicated to consent.
  More than half of respondents

Rape and sexual assault happen because people put themselves
in bad situations.
When someone is raped or sexually assaulted, it™s often because 
the way they said "no" was unclear or there was some 
miscommunication.
A person who is sexually assaulted or raped while she or he is
drunk is at least somewhat responsible for putting themselves in
that position.
Many women who claim they were raped agreed to have sex
and then regretted it afterwards.

 4  2. Sexual 
Misconduct
   The survey asked respondents two sets of questions regarding 
unwanted
 sexual experiences since coming to MIT. 
The first asked if they had been 
sexually harassed, 
raped or sexually assaulted (referred to below as ﬁlabeled 
experiences
ﬂ), and the second set of questions asked if they had experienced a variety of specific unwan
ted sexual 
behaviors, 
including attempted and completed
. In 
total, 
539 respondents indicated having experienced 
some form 
of 
unwanted sexual behavior
 including 
284
 undergraduate female respondents, 
94 undergraduate male 
respondents, 
102 graduate female res
pondents, 
49 graduate male respondents, and 10 transgender or other
-gendered respondents. (Further breakouts for students
 who identified as transgender or other genders are not 
included in this document to protect the privacy of the small sample size.) 
  Labeled Experiences
  Participants were asked about a series of ﬁlabeledﬂ 
unwanted
 sexual experiences. These questions included 
commonly used terms, and did not define these terms (except for ﬁsexual harassmentﬂ which included a hover text 

explanation), all
owing respondents to apply their own interpretations.
 Overall,
 8% indicated being either sexually 
harassed, sexually assaulted,
 and/or
 raped

 5  Sexual Assault
  For this section, p
articipants were asked about a series of 
specific unwanted
 sexual 
behaviors that they may have 
experienced while at MIT.
 Respondents could indicate that they had experienced multiple unwanted behaviors, 
even if they occurred in a single incident.
   In Table 2
.2, we summarize the 
unwanted sexual behaviors experienced at MIT by respondents who indicated that 
one or more of these experiences involved the use of force or a weapon (5%), threat of physical harm 
(1%), or 
incapacitation (being t
aken 
advantage of wh
ile too drunk, high, asleep or out of it 
Œ 44%). 
Out of 
3,232 male and 
female respondents answering the behavioral questions, 6.5% (208 respondents) indicated one or more unwanted 
sexual behaviors 
involving force, physical threat, or incapacitation

 6  Engaging in Unwanted Sexual Behavior
  When survey participants were asked about their behavior towards others, 1.9% of the respondents said they had 
acted in a way that would be considered unwanted sexual behavior, and another 2.2% indicated they were unsure 
if they had behaved in this way. Mo
re than one in five undergraduate respondents indicated knowing a perpetrator. 
  Reporting 
  Close to two
-thirds (63%) of respondents who indicated they had an unwanted sexual experience at MIT told 
someone else about the incident(s), but fewer than 5% rep
orted the experience(s) to someone in an official 

capacity. 
   Respondents who told someone about their experiences were most likely to tell a friend (90%), family (19%), 
or a medical professional (13%).
  For the 5% of respondents who did report the experien
ce to someone in an official capacity, the MIT resource 
most often contacted was Violence Prevention and Response (VPR).
  90% of the respondents who told someone or reported an unwanted sexual experience received at least one 
response that made them feel su
pported.
  Respondents who indicated they had experienced an unwanted sexual behavior were asked if any thoughts or 
concerns crossed their mind when deciding whether or not to share their experience. Of those responding:
 o 72% did not think the incident(s) was
 serious enough to 
officially 
report
 o 55% indicated it was not clear harm was intended
 o 47% did not want any action to be taken (i.e. arrests, legal action, disciplinary action) 
 o 44% felt that they were at least partly at fault or it wasn™t totally the other
 person™s fault 
  Specific Incident: Locations
, Perpetrators
 and Impacts
  
Respondents were asked follow
-up questions about a specific incident of unwanted sexual behavior at MIT. 
Because respondents may have experienced more than one incident of unwanted s
exual behavior, survey takers 
were instructed to respond to this section about the single experience at MIT ﬁthat has impacted or affected you 
the most.ﬂ 
  Specific incidents of unwanted sexual experiences while at MIT were reported for undergraduates as o
ccurring 
primarily on campus
Š in residential buildings or in other MIT
-affiliated housing such as fraternities, sororities, or 
independent living groups, with more than 80% of female and male undergraduate respondents who experienced 
an unwanted sexual beh
avior indicating that the incident(s) took place on the MIT campus. Close to half of the 
graduate student respondents (47%) indicated that the incident(s) took place off campus. 
  Most (72%) respondents indicated that another MIT student was responsible fo
r the unwanted sexual behavior. 
Almost all female respondents 
(98%) 
who reported an unwanted sexual behavior indicated the perpetrators were 
males. The male respondents who reported an unwanted sexual behavior indicated the perpetrators were either 
males
 (35%)
 or females
 (67%)
. Of those 
who indicated 
experiencing an unwanted sexual behavior, 9% had no prior 
relationship with the perpetrator and did not know or were unsure if the person was affiliated with MIT.
 40% of 
female and male undergraduate respondents indicat
ed
 the perpetrator was a friend.
  Survey participants were asked about the impact of their experience with unwanted sexual behavior. Questions 
ranged from symptoms of post
-traumatic stress to 
disruptions in eating, sleeping and taking care of oneself, 
including substance abuse, suicidal ideation, and negative effects on academic work. Of the respondents who 

indicated an unwanted sexual experience at MIT, the most common impacts included being u
nable to work or 
complete assignments
 (35%)
, being unable to eat
 (30%)
, loss of interest in intimacy or sex
 (36%)
, and grades 
dropping
 (29%)

 7  3. Community Behaviors & Use of Institute Resources
  Bystander Actions
  Virtually all (97%) respondents agree they 
would respect someone who did something to prevent sexual assault.
   
Over half (56%) of the respondents who knew a perpetrator did not confront the person about their behaviors or 
take any action. Of those who indicated they took action, 38% said they spok
e to the person about their behavior, 
and 4% reported it to an MIT employee or the police.
  Respondents indicated a variety of reasons for not taking any action including not knowing the person well enough, 
not having enough proof to act, someone else havi
ng already reported it, the victim not wanting action taken, 
and/or not wanting anyone else to know about what had happened.
  
82% of respondents reported taking at least one protective action ﬁalways or usuallyﬂ, including making sure to 

leave a party with
 the same people they come with, or offering to walk an intoxicated friend home. 70% of 
undergraduate respondents ﬁalways or usuallyﬂ make sure to leave a party with the same people they came with, 
while 50% of females and 59% of males do not usually try t
o distract someone who is trying to take a drunk person 
to do something sexual.

Response bias is expected in virtually any voluntary survey, particularly one focused on a narrow topic. While we 
invited all enrolled graduate and undergraduate stu
dents to take this survey, and more than one
-third responded, it 
is not possible to know if students self
-selected in or out of the survey in a way that would bias our results. For 
example, it is difficult to determine whether students who have experienced
 sexual assault were more or less likely 
to respond to the survey. This does not make the findings from the survey any less accurate; it simply means that 

the rates based on those who responded to the survey cannot be extrapolated to the MIT student popula
tion as a 
whole, and cannot be validly compared to results from other surveys.
