He was answering a question (in bold below) regarding a specific relationship between CTE and playing football...not the relationship between football and traumatic brain injury as was stated in the story you quoted in your inquiry.
 No data in your mind, to have a relationship between CTE and playing football?
 No, that's absurd.
 There's no data that in any way creates knowledge.
 There's no way that you can have made a comment that there's an association or some type of assertion.
 So that's where we are.
 It didn't alter at all what we're doing about it.
 We're doing everything we can to understand it and make it safer.
