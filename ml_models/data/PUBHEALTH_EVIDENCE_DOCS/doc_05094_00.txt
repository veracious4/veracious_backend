 We examined the behaviour of tabanids (horse flies) in the vicinity of captive plains zebras and uniformly coloured domestic horses living on a horse farm in Britain.
 Observations showed that fewer tabanids landed on zebras than on horses per unit time, although rates of tabanid circling around or briefly touching zebra and horse pelage did not differ.
 In an experiment in which horses sequentially wore cloth coats of different colours, those wearing a striped pattern suffered far lower rates of tabanid touching and landing on coats than the same horses wearing black or white, yet there were no differences in attack rates to their naked heads.
 In separate, detailed video analyses, tabanids approached zebras faster and failed to decelerate before contacting zebras, and proportionately more tabanids simply touched rather than landed on zebra pelage in comparison to horses.
 Taken together, these findings indicate that, up close, striped surfaces prevented flies from making a controlled landing but did not influence tabanid behaviour at a distance.
 To counteract flies, zebras swished their tails and ran away from fly nuisance whereas horses showed higher rates of skin twitching.
 As a consequence of zebras’ striping, very few tabanids successfully landed on zebras and, as a result of zebras’ changeable behaviour, few stayed a long time, or probed for blood.

 IntroductionThe function of zebra stripes has been a source of scientific interest for over 150 years generating many hypotheses including camouflage, confusion of predators, signaling to conspecifics, thermoregulation and avoidance of biting flies [1] but contemporary data show that only one stands up to careful scrutiny [2–4].
 Briefly, regarding camouflage, zebra stripes are difficult for lion Panthera leo and spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta predators to resolve at any great distance making crypsis against mammalian predators an unlikely benefit [5].
 Regarding confusion of predators, zebras do not have the sort of striping pattern that aids in confusion [6] and African lions take zebra prey disproportionately more than expected suggesting an absence of confusion effect [7].
 Regarding social benefits, rates of grooming and patterns of association are no greater in striped equids than in unstriped equids [3].
 Finally, there are no thermoregulatory benefits to striping based on controlled experiments using water drums [4], infrared photography of free-living herbivores [3] and logical argument in regards to flank striping [8].
 Instead, there is an emerging consensus among biologists that the primary function of contrasting black and white stripes on the three species of zebras is to thwart attack from tabanids, and possibly glossinids, stomoxys and other biting muscoids based on laboratory and field experiments with striped materials [3, 9–12] and on comparative evidence [13].
 In Africa where zebras live, tabanids carry diseases fatal to zebras including trypanosomiasis, equine infectious anemia, African horse sickness and equine influenza [14] and zebras are particularly susceptible to infection because their thin pelage allows biting flies to probe successfully with their mouthparts [13].
 The exact mechanism by which stripes prevent flies from obtaining a blood meal is less well understood, however.
 Flies may fail to detect a zebra from a distance, or from close up, either as a result of misinterpreting optic flow as they approach [15], by interfering with cues that promote a landing response [9, 16], or even by disrupting the polarization signature of their host [12].
 Unfortunately, detailed observations of biting flies in the vicinity of live zebras have so far been unavailable but such information would help elucidate the stage at which stripes exert an effect on host seeking by biting flies.
 In this study we compare several measures of behaviour of wild tabanid horse flies around captive zebras and domestic horses living in the same habitat using direct observations and video footage.
 We also compare the behaviour of tabanids around horses wearing differently coloured cloth coats, report on the duration of time that tabanids spend on equids with different coloured pelage, and compare the behaviour of horses and zebras in response to biting fly annoyance.
 MethodsWe studied captive plains zebras (Equus burchelli or E. quagga) (three females) and uniformly coloured white, grey, brown and black domestic horses (E. caballus) (three females, six males) at the Hill Livery, Dundry, North Somerset, UK (51.4100° N, 2.6469° W) in July 2016, and June and July 2017.
 We video recorded individual equids or took records by hand (from a distance of 1-2m) of tabanid (Haematopota pluvialis and Tabanus bromius) flies in the vicinity of their hosts; female European tabanids require a blood meal to produce eggs [17].
 We also recorded equids’ reactions to these diptera.
 Horses and zebras were always kept in separate but adjacent fields and were both observed and videoed on the same days.
 The size of the zebra field was larger than two of the horse fields, similar in size to another, whereas two other horse fields were larger still; all were surrounded by hedges of similar structure and width.
 Pasture was the same in all fields and hay was put out intermittently in all of them.
 Study 1: Direct observations During a total of 16.3 hours of observation of three zebras and nine horses (, range 0.7–22.3min) an observer (TC), standing on one side of the equid at 1-2m distance, recorded the number of tabanids circling around, touching, and landing on each host.
 Touching occurred rapidly and consisted either of the fly’s dorsum or head bumping into the pelage ( 2sec but usually for between 20 sec to 10 min.
 For zebras, we recorded whether tabanids touched or landed on either black or white stripes.
 Then, focusing attention on those tabanids that actually landed properly, we recorded the number of times that a fly walked over the pelage, or probed for a source of blood.
 Probing was defined as lowering the head and thorax thereby tilting the abdomen up vertically or obliquely.
 Study 2: Coats We placed three cloth coats in turn on seven (6 males, 1 female) horses each for 30 consecutive minutes in a fully randomized order.
 One was a dark black Rambo Optimo stable sheet, one was a bright white Shires Equestrian Products One Performance flysheet and neck set, and the third was a black and white irregularly striped BUCAS Buzz-off zebra full neck coat.
 Coats were purchased commercially with no attempt at standardization of material.
 The outer surface of the black coat was made of “1000D ripstop polyester”; the white of “cool mesh”; and the striped of “fine mesh fabric”.
 We assumed that coat thickness would have no effect on its attractiveness to tabanids from a distance since the only documented structural effects of tabanid traps pertain to overall trap design [18].
 Coats differed in UV reflectance with the white coat and white stripes of the “zebra” coat reflecting respectively a medium amount, and a lot of UV; the black stripes and black coat reflected very little (Figure A in S1 File).
 Each coat covered the horse’s rump, back, flank, belly, withers and neck but not the head or ears which were left naked.
 Two observers (JB and JL who knew of the hypotheses being tested) always stood 1-2m away simultaneously recording the number of tabanid flies landing on each side of the cloth coat and on the uncovered head.
 Animals were only watched in the open and never in the shade.
 Since flies were not recognized individually, the same tabanid could have landed or touched the horse multiple times but there was no a priori reason to think that this occurred differentially according to coat colour.
 Study 3: Videos of flies on equids Video recordings were collected (JB and JL) of three zebras and seven horses (two females, five males) using a Panasonic HC-X900 camera (Osaka, Japan) always from a fixed distance of approximately 3m.
 From these, the length of time that tabanids remained on equid pelage during observations of one side of the animal (18.97 hours’ observations of 10 equids), their whereabouts on ten regions of the pelage (Figure B in S1 File), and whether the individual tabanid left voluntarily or was forced off by the host, was recorded from the videos (by EB and MJM who had no prior knowledge of the hypotheses).
 Flight trajectories of tabanids in the vicinity of horses and zebras were extracted from the video recordings (MH) by marking their position every 0.02s using Matlab 2017b (Mathworks, Natick, USA).
 The use of custom-written zoom tools ensured that fly location could be digitized to the nearest pixel, resulting in accurate and repeatable tracks.
 Trajectories were divided into three segments as follows.
 An “approach” was the flight trajectory starting from when the fly entered the camera’s view until it performed its first deceleration and turning manoeuvre close to the pelage of the animal.
 This was usually a direct flight starting from the side of the camera’s field of view, but sometimes contained loops of flight at a distance from the animal (Fig 1).
 A “leave” was when the fly made a direct and accelerating flight away from the host ending out of the camera’s field of view.
 This started from the moment the fly took off from the animal, or manoeuvred away from close to the animal (Fig 1).
 An “investigation” was the period in between, when the fly was hovering around the pelage of the animal.
 (It therefore corresponds most closely to circling as recorded during direct observations).
 Speed, duration and tortuosity (distance traveled divided by the distance between the start and finish points) were calculated for the three trajectory segments.
 Note that these measures only approximate the true speed and tortuosity of the fly, as flight paths were recorded in a two-dimensional plane using a single camera and would not necessarily end in host contact.
 While flight speed and trajectory may have been influenced by angle of approach relative to the position of the camera, flight durations were not.
 In addition, flight speeds in the 0.5 seconds prior to landing and touching the hosts were determined, from which a comparison between horses and zebras was made using a linear mixed model (‘lmer’, R3.4.4, CRAN) with individual fly as a fixed effect [speed ~ time+species+(1|fly)].
 P values were calculated using Satterthwaite’s method in the R package ‘lmerTest’.

 Red arrows indicate direction of flight.
 Blue stars show points of contact or landings on the equid.
 Blue arrows show the end position of the approach and start position of the leave phases of flight.
 These markers are associated with manoeuvres that show changes in both direction and speed, and where this could not be reliably identified (e.g.
 approach in a) the data were omitted from analysis.
 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210831.g001  Study 4: Videos of equid behaviour From video recordings of three female zebras and eight (3 female, 5 male) individual horses in 2017 (17.9hours total), MK and SR (who had no knowledge of the hypotheses) recorded 19 different patterns of behaviour shown by equids in response to biting flies (Table A in S1 File).
 from which rates per minute were calculated (, range 5.0–127.7min).
 In 2016 from videos, YA recorded parasite avoidance behaviours of the same three zebras, two different horses (1 male, 1 female) and one female plains zebra-somali wild ass (E. africanus) hybrid (4.0hours total, , range 15.6–61.7min).
 The focus of our study was on tabanid flies of which there were many at the Livery.
 Since fly activity around equids could have been influenced by weather conditions (e.g.
 [3]), we used data from Filton, the nearest meteorological office, 17km northeast of Dundry, to approximate mean temperatures, solar radiation, maximum wind gust speeds, average windspeeds, relative humidity and cloud cover each hour that the equids were observed.
 This may have been because we did not go out to the farm when the weather was wet or windy, so all our data are from calm weather conditions.
 The study received approval from the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board at the University of Bristol (reference UB/18/074).
