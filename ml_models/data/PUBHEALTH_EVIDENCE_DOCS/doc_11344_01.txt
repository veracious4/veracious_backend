From basic information about cancer and its causes to in-depth information on specific cancer types – including risk factors, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment options – you’ll find it here.
 It’s also important to follow recommended screening guidelines, which can help detect certain cancers early.
 We can even find you a free ride to treatment or a free place to stay when treatment is far from home.
 Research.
 We’ve invested more than $4.9 billion in cancer research since 1946, all to find more – and better – treatments, uncover factors that may cause cancer, and improve cancer patients’ quality of life.

 Since the updated staging system for breast cancer now also includes estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 status, the stages may be higher or lower than previous staging systems.
 Whether or not treatment strategies will change with this new staging system are yet to be determined.
 You should discuss your stage and treatment options with your physician.
 The stage (extent) of your breast cancer is an important factor in making decisions about your treatment options.
 In general, the more the breast cancer has spread, the more treatment you will likely need.
 But other factors can also be important, such as:  If the cancer cells contain hormone receptors (that is, if the cancer is ER-positive or PR-positive) If the cancer cells have large amounts of the HER2 protein (that is, if the cancer is HER2-positive) Your overall health and personal preferences If you have gone through menopause or not How fast the cancer is growing (measured by grade or other measures)  Talk with your doctor about how these factors can affect your treatment options.
 Stage 0    Stage 0 means that the cancer is limited to the inside of the milk duct and is non-invasive.
 Treatment for this non-invasive breast tumor is often different from the treatment of invasive breast cancer.
 Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a stage 0 breast tumor.
 Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) used to be categorized as stage 0, but this has been changed because it is not cancer.
 Still, it does indicate a higher risk of breast cancer.
 See Lobular Carcinoma in Situ (LCIS) for more information.
 Treatment of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS)               Stages I-III    Treatment for stages I to III breast cancer usually includes surgery and radiation therapy, often with chemo or other drug therapies either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery.
 Stage I: These breast cancers are still relatively small and either have not spread to the lymph nodes or have only a tiny area of cancer spread in the sentinel lymph node (the first lymph node to which cancer is likely to spread).
 Stage II: These breast cancers are larger than stage I cancers and/or have spread to a few nearby lymph nodes.
 Stage III: These tumors are larger or are growing into nearby tissues (the skin over the breast or the muscle underneath), or they have spread to many nearby lymph nodes.
 Treatment of Breast Cancer Stages I-III               Stage IV (metastatic breast cancer)    Stage IV cancers have spread beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes to other parts of the body.
 Treatment for stage IV breast cancer is usually a systemic (drug) therapy.
 Treatment of Stage IV (Metastatic) Breast Cancer               Recurrent breast cancer    Cancer is called recurrent when it comes back after primary treatment.
 Recurrence can be local (in the same breast or in the surgery scar), regional (in nearby lymph nodes), or in a distant area.
 Treatment for recurrent breast cancer  depends on where the cancer recurs and what treatments you’ve had before.
