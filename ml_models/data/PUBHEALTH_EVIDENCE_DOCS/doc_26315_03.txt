JEPSEN,Chairman, Joint Economic Committee,Congress of the United States, Washington, D.C.DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Transmitted herewith for the use of theJoint Economic Committee and other Members of Congress is astudy entitled "Estimating the Effects of Economic Change on Na-tional Health and Social Well-Being" by Dr. M. Harvey Brenner ofthe Johns Hopkins University.This study examines long-term relationships between aggregatemeasures of economic conditions and social pathology, includingmortality rates, physical and mental illness, and criminal aggres-sion. It updates and refines the analysis of a study prepared for theCommittee by the author in 1976. Like the earlier study, this workprovides policymakers with a basis for assessing the human conse-quences-and costs to society as a whole-of a particular pattern ofeconomic activity.Since 1980, the United States has endured back-to-back reces-sions and the worst levels of unemployment since the 1930s. Cur-rently 8.5 million Americans are jobless. The national unemploy-ment rate exceeded 10 percent for 10 months. At the worst point ofthe recession nearly 12 million people, or 10.7 percent of the work-force, were unemployed. In two years, unemployment has risen bymore than 40 percent and directly touched at least one-fourth of allpersons in the work force. Among families with one or more mem-bers in the labor force, 29 percent had at least one person unem-ployed in 1981 and 33 percent had someone unemployed in 1982.Economists have taken stock of some of the economic costs of re-cession. Because of idle labor and plant capacity, output of goodsand services has run between $250 billion and $300 billion a yearbelow the economy's potential in recent years.Moreover, recessions can have harmful effects on productivitylong after they have technically ended. Investments in both physi-cal and human resources which could add to our productivity inthe future are undertaken less frequently in periods of excess ca-pacity. Other productivity losses occur as the skills of idled workersobsolesce.There may also be long-term damage to the labor market pros-pects of those out of work-especially persons unemployed for six.months or more. Besides experiencing greater trouble finding newjobs, such workers are most likely to take jobs with lower wagesand benefits than they had previously. Studies of past recessionssuggest that young people in the process of establishing their ca-reers are most seriously impeded by lengthy spells of unemploy-(III) lvment. Some of them never catch up. In this recession, the numberof long-term unemployed reached nearly 3 million, an all-timehigh. Over 1 out of 5 of these unemployed persons are teenagers oryoung adults.Much of the burden of unemployment is sustained by the joblessthemselves. Typically, workers losses of income are only partiallyreplaced by unemployment compensation and other transfer pay-ments. The financial hardship is frequently compounded by theloss of critical benefits, like health insurance, which were tied tothe job.Joblessness may also subject family relationships to considerablestrain. The psychological pressures on individuals are intensifiedby feelings of failure, guilt over the inability to support their fami-lies, and loss of self-esteem. Greater stress may affect the entirehousehold, not just those out of work. The longer this situation en-dures, the more likely it becomes that frustrations will be ventedon the family-or on the rest of society.Although many transfer programs and social services for the un-employed have been reduced in scope in this recession, the steepincreases in joblessness continued to push public expenditures up.At the same time, high unemployment has reduced tax revenuesavailable to all levels of government. At the Federal level, the com-bined effect on the deficit from those so-called "automatic" tax andspending changes is in the range of $30 billion to $35 billion foreach one percentage point rise in the national unemployment rate.Other costs to society as a whole are harder to quantify. Thisstudy, in looking at how particular social indicators vary in accord-ance with changes in aggregate economic performance, makes avaluable contribution to this process of estimation.Using data from 1950 through 1980, the study examined the rela-tionship between economic changes and nine indicators of socialstress. These indicators include: total mortality rates; cardiovascu-lar-renal disease mortality; cirrhosis of the liver mortality; mentalhospital admissions; suicide rates; homicide rates; state prison ad-missions; total arrest rates; and the incidence of major crimes re-ported to the police. The principal economic measures are: percapita income (adjusted for inflation); unemployment rates; laborforce participation rates; and business failure rates.Relationships are analyzed for the total population as well as dif-ferent age, sex, and race subgroups. In tracking these relationshipsover time, the study takes into account several external factors-such as alcohol, cigarette, and fat consumption-which pose risksto health: As compared with the previous study, the ability to "con-trol" for the influence of these external factors strengthens the in-terpretation of the statistical findings.The study found important relationships, comparable in magni-tude to those of the earlier research, between economic changesand most of the principal measures of social pathology. As summa-rized in Table A, for example, the 14 percent increase in unemploy-ment prior to the 1974-75 recession was linked to the followingsocial changes: a 2.3 percent increase in the overall mortality rate;a 2.8 percent increase in the cardiovascular mortality rate; a 1.4percent increase in the cirrhosis of the liver mortality rate; a 6 per-cent increase in admissions to state mental hospitals; a 1 percent Vincrease in the suicide rate; a 6 percent increase in total arrests;and a 1.1 percent increase in assaults. Additional increases insocial pathology were associated with the 3 percent drop in real percapita income and the sharp rise in business failures which oc-curred during this period.TABLE A.-IMPACT OF A 14.3 PERCENT RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT DURING 1973-74Change related to InraeiPathological indicator 4 Increase ofTotal mortality .................................................................................................................................. ... .... ................... 2.3 45,936Cardiovascular mortality ................................................................................................................... ... .... ................... 2.8 28,510C irrhosis mortality............................................................................................................................ .1. 4 430Suicide ............................................................................................................................................. .. ... ..................... 1.0 270Population in mental hospitals......................................................................................................... 6.0 8,416Total arrests..................................................................................................................................... 6.0 577,477Arrests for fraud and embezzlement................................................................................................ .4.8 11,552Assaults reported to police............................................................................................................... 1.1 7,035Homicide ..................................................... 1.7 403'lncreases in the homicide rate were found to be related to rising unemployment among males age 16-24, expressed as a proportion of thetotal unemployment rateWith three exceptions, these figures reflect the cumulativechanges in pathology rates over a six year period. Because chronicdiseases take longer to develop and detect, the changes in cardio-vascular mortality, cirrhosis mortality, and total mortality were es-timated to occur within 16 years. They should be viewed as mini-mum estimates, since only a subset of possible problems are exam-ined. Moreover, the measures of pathology do not capture some ofthe less extreme consequences-like nonfatal illness and crimesthat do not result in incarceration-that may have been influencedby economic factors.Naturally, since a myriad of other factors contribute to social pa-thology, the rates of change associated with the economic measuresappear small. But the costs, in human and dollar terms, are sub-stantial. Calculations in this study show that over 45,000 deathscan be attributed to the rise in unemployment that occurred at theonset of the 1974-75 recession and that the drop in real per capitaincome at that time brought about 60,000 deaths. The increased un-employment in this example was also linked with 270 additionalsuicides, 8,416 additional admissions to mental hospitals, and577,477 additional arrests.In interpreting such findings, it must be emphasized that thestudy deals only with aggregate relationships. Thus it does not sup-port conclusions about the behavior of individuals: some one wholoses a job does not, necessarily, have a greater likelihood of com-mitting a crime or dying from a stress-related illness. However, thefindings for the population as a whole suggest that stress inducedby economic conditions can lead to shorter life, more illness, andincreased aggression for the employed as well as the jobless.Besides clarifying the human consequences of adverse economicperformance, the results of this study can be used to gauge thedollar costs of increased pathology to society as a whole. While thecalculations involved are necessarily rough, they point to a wide VIrange of direct and indirect costs associated with unemployment.The magnitudes should underscore to policymakers the importanceof keeping unemployment at a minimum.In 1977, according to a recent study by the Research Triangle In-stitute in North Carolina, the cost to society of problems related toalcohol, drug abuse, and mental illness amounted to $106 billion.This figure includes both direct expenditures on health care (inhospitals, clinics, nursing homes, as well as physicians' services anddrugs) and an estimate of indirect costs-principally the lost or re-duced productivity of those who become ill. The latter measure at-tempts to value the goods and services (including unpaid householdservices) of which society has been deprived due to illness, disabil-ity, or death. While over $88 billion of the total is accounted for bythe costs of medical care and forgone income, a variety of other fac-tors-particularly in the case of drug abuse-are economically im-portant: for example, the costs of crimes committed by drug addictsand corresponding outlays of the criminal justice system.For each of the pathologies considered in this study, similar costestimates can be obtained. For example, heart attacks and strokescost the Nation $109 billion in 1975 in medical services and forgoneearnings of those afflicted; one year's homicide victims, accordingto a 1976 estimate by this Committee, would have earned $3.6 bil-lion over the course of normal lifetimes. Of course, only a fractionof the cost in any of these cases can be attributable to economicfactors. But based on the increments of additional pathology foundby the study to be related to economic changes, an appropriate por-tion of the cost can be calculated.Based on changes in unemployment, income, and other condi-tions in the mid-1970s, Dr. Brenner estimates dollar losses due torecession-related increases in mortality at $26 billion. As shown inTable B. These are resources taken from productive use, whichreduce the real wealth of our society. Undoubtedly, the sharperrises in joblessness during the current recession would mean evengreater losses now.TABLE B.-ECONOMIC LOSS IN MILLIONS OF 1980 DOLLARS DUE TO CHANGES IN UNEMPLOYMENT,PER CAPITA INCOME, AND THE BUSINESS FAILURE RATE DURING 1973 AND 1974*Social stress indicator Representing economic cost of EconomCa rdiovascular mortality ........................................................ o f the circulatory s ystem 15,950Population in mental hospitals .Hospitalization in State and county mental institutions 495Suicide .......,. ....Suicide ................................. 31Total arrests........................................................................

And that a major deterio-ration of economic conditions will have a pathological impact on Vilhundreds of thousands of people, with a multi-billion dollar cost tosociety extending far into the future. It is incumbent upon us, informulating economic policy, to understand these links and to rec-ognize that substantial social costs are preventable.The study was prepared by Dr. Brenner under the guidance ofMr. William Robinson, Chief of the Education and Public WelfareDivision of the Congressional Research Service, and Ken Cahill,Specialist in Social Legislation at CRS.

HAMILTON,Chairman, Subcommittee on Economic Goals and Intergovernmen-tal Policy, Joint Economic Committee, Congress of the UnitedStates, Washington, D.C.DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In response to the request of your commit-tee, I am submitting a report entitled "Estimating the Effects ofEconomic Change on National Health and Social Well-Being, " byDr. M. Harvey Brenner. The report was prepared by Dr. Brennerunder contracts with both the Congressional Research Service andthe Joint Economic Committee.This report is an update and refinement of an earlier study doneby Dr. Brenner and published by the Joint Economic Committee in1976. Among its results, this earlier study found that increases inthe unemployment rate were related to the social well-being of thepopulation. Increases in mortality, mental ill health, and criminalbehavior were found to be associated with economic instability, asmeasured by changes in unemployment. Due in part to the veryhigh unemployment rates of the past several years, the committeerequested that the Congressional Research Service assist in updat-ing the 1976 study.The present report both affirms and extends the findings of the1976 study. Dr. Brenner once again finds that increases in longterm real income have beneficial consequences for social well-being. Also confirmed are the negative associations between eco-nomic instability, particularly unemployment and the business fail-ure rate, and certain aspects of social well-being. In addition, thepresent study refines the statistical model developed for the 1976report. Dr. Brenner reports that these refinements both enhance Villthe confidence with which the results can be viewed and extendthe research so that new findings are reported.New results are presented in several areas. Measures of econom-ic instability other than the unemployment rate-decline in laborforce participation, decline in average weekly hours worked, andincreases in the business failure rate-are reported to be stronglyassociated with increased mortality. The study shows associationsbetween economic inequality and deterioration in mental healthand well-being. Finally, the report presents new evidence on the re-lationships between pathological conditions and certain risk factorssuch as alcohol and cigarette consumption, illicit drug use, high di-vorce rates and the proportion of the population living alone.Dr. Brenner's study breaks new ground in its development of asophisticated statistical model of complex social and economic rela-tionships. As with any model of this complexity, the results areprofoundly affected by the theory and assumptions inherent in theresearch design and on which there may be disagreement amongexperts. We believe that this study, read together with a review ofresearch in the field, "Economic Change, Physical Illness, MentalIllness, and Social Change," prepared by Dr. Jeanne Gordus undercontract with the Congressional Research Service, makes a stimu-lating contribution to the national debate.We hope this report by Dr. Brenner will serve the needs of yourcommittee as well as those of other committees and Members ofCongress.Sincerely,GILBERT GUDE,Director, Congressional Research Service,Library of Congress.

Harvey Brenner, Ph.D.I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThis study examines the relationships between changes in U.S.economic performance and national measures of social pathology.It updates a 1976 study entitled "Estimating the Social Costs of Na-tional Economic Policy: Implications for Mental and PhysicalHealth and Criminal Aggression," prepared for the Joint EconomicCommittee by the author. The new results reinforce the 1976 find-ings that high unemployment and other adverse economic develop-ments may have costly social implications.The 1976 study focused on a period of approximately 35 years, be-ginning between 1935 and 1940, and ending between 1970 and 1973.The economic and social factors considered in the 1976 study in-cluded the delayed effects of the Great Depression, World War II,and the ensuing post-war business cycles.Data for the current report cover the years from 1950 to 1980.Employing a model that advances the 1976 analysis, the currentstudy takes into account the general economic changes of recentyears-the economic growth of the 1960s, the oil price shocks andeconomic stasis of the early 1970s, and the depressed economy ofthe late 1970s (and 1980).Since publication of the earlier report, a major shift in the im-portant causes of death has been emphasized in the research litera-ture. Whereas infectious diseases were the major causes of morbidi-ty and mortality during the period examined in the 1976 report,chronic diseases and external causes such as suicide, homicide, andaccidents have replaced them. Certain factors posing a risk tohealth have also grown more serious. This analysis examines therelationships between certain risk factors and each indicator of pa-thology; for example, alcohol consumption and cirrhosis; consump-tion of fat and ischemic heart disease; and the divorce rate andmental hospital admissions.The new report takes advantage of refined measures of economicdistress and social pathology. The unemployment rate, for example,was the only indicator of recession in the 1976 report, with theresult that the pathological implications of recession may havebeen understated. In the current work, additional measures such aslabor force participation rates and the business failure rate im-prove the calculation.The present study also uses refined numerical estimates of thechanges in social pathologies associated with economic change (e.g.,(1) 2the number of additional deaths associated with rising unemploy-ment). The 1976 study made estimates based on a sustained in-crease in unemployment over a 6-year period. This report estimatesthe social implications of economic change and other measuresover periods ranging from 1 to 15 years.THE BASIC RESEARCH QUESTIONSUsing new data and advanced measurement techniques, the cur-rent study addresses the following research questions:Will the addition of new data after 1973 (when unemploy-ment levels reached their highest since the 1930s) alter theconclusions of the previous report?Is economic growth still associated with longer life spans de-spite the influence of "diseases of affluence" (chronic diseaseswhich result from a high per capita consumption of alcohol,cigarettes and fats) and high levels of environmental toxins?Do the new, refined methods of measuring the relationsunder study nullify earlier findings or strengthen them?Will indicators of recession other than unemployment (suchas declines in labor force participation and average weeklyhours worked and increases in business failure rates) be associ-ated with increased social pathology?Will the absence of important factors used in the previousstudy (the effects of the Great Depression, World War II, andthe first post-war recession) alter the basic findings?After the first post-recession rise in mortality rates, will ad-ditional waves of increased mortality be observed?Are there relationships between measures of social pathologyand measures of relative deprivation, as sociological and psy-chological theories would suggest? Do the relative measuresprovide a more powerful statistical explanation than thosebased on economic loss alone?MAJOR FINDINGSThis study both presents important new findings and reconfirmsmany of the findings of the 1976 study. In general, the results ofthe present study are consistent with research findings at the indi-vidual, state, and national levels, and with findings in the field ofepidemiology, which documents the incidence and distribution ofdisease in a population. The following sections briefly describe themajor new findings, compare them with the 1976 study, and relatethem to findings of other research studies which employ differentanalytic techniques.1. New ResultsThe study indicates that economic growth continues to be closelyrelated to longer life spans, at all ages and for both sexes. This re-mains true despite the influence of health risk factors such as highconsumption of alcohol, tobacco, and animal fats and those alter-ations in the family structure which are associated with increasednational wealth. 3Equally important results show that several measures of econom-ic recession and structural economic instability are related to mor-tality. In addition to a high unemployment rate, three other fac-tors-decline in labor force participation, decline in average weeklyhours worked, and an increase in the rate of business failures-arestrongly associated with increased mortality, and the associationsare apparent during a period of 2-3 years or less. Long-term (7-15years) relationships between economic recession and increased mor-tality can also be observed.The study also finds that economic inequality is associated withdeterioration in mental health and well-being, manifest in in-creased rates of homicide, crime, and mental hospital admissions.Finally, the report presents new evidence on the relationships be-tween pathological conditions and certain risk factors-per capitaalcohol consumption (by beverage type); cigarette consumption; il-licit drug traffic and use; divorce rates; and the proportion of thepopulation living alone.A detailed review of the quantitative estimates of the relation-ships between recession and social pathologies occurring between1950 and 1980 is presented in Chapter V. Examples of these esti-mates, when applied to the 1973-1974 recession or, in one case, to1978-79, follow:Between 1973 and 1974, the unemployment rate rose 14.3 per-cent, the real per capita income declined 3.0 percent, and theannual change in business failure rate increased 200 percent.The increased unemployment rate during 1973-74 is associatedwith the following: a 2.3 percent increase in the total mortalityrate, or 45,936 deaths, from all causes; a mortality rate increase of2.8 percent, or 28,510 deaths, from cardiovascular disease; a mortal-ity rate increase of 1.4 percent, or 430 deaths, from cirrhosis; amental hospital admission rate increase of 6.0 percent, or 8,416 per-sons hospitalized; an arrest rate increase of 6.0 percent, or 577,477persons arrested; an assault rate increase of 1.1 percent, or 7,035assaults reported to the police; and a suicide rate increase of 1.0percent, or 270 known suicides.The decline in the trend in real per capita income during 1973-74 is related to the following: an increase in the total mortalityrate of 3.0 percent, or 59,996 deaths, from all causes; a mortalityrate increase of 4.4 percent, or 45,189 deaths, from cardiovasculardisease; a mortality rate increase of 2.7 percent, or 806 deaths,from cirrhosis; and a suicide rate increase of 1.11 percent, or 320known suicides. In addition, the increase in annual changes in thebusiness failure rate is associated with a 9 percent increase in thecardiovascular mortality rate, or 95,680 cardiovascular deaths.Age-specific relationships are the basis of the overall aggregateestimates. It is therefore possible to cumulate numbers within eachdistinct category of pathology where the relationships to each ofthe three economic factors are similar across age groups. A basicsimilarity in relationships to the three economic factors, for exam-ple, exists among age groups in cardiovascular disease mortality.Thus, for cardiovascular disease, the combination of the 1973-74 in-crease in the unemployment rate, the decrease in the trend of realper capita income, and the increase in the annual change in thebusiness failure rate is related to an overall increase of more than 4165,000 deaths over a 10-year period (the greatest proportion ofwhich occurs within 3 years).Finally, the ratio of youth unemployment (unemployed personsaged 16-24) to total unemployment rates increased by 9 percent be-tween 1978 and 1979. That increase in the youth unemploymentratio is related to an increase in the homicide rate of 1.7 percent,or 403 deaths, by violence.The 1973-74 increase in the unemployment rate, decrease in realper capita income, and increase in the annual change in the busi-ness failure rate are related to more than $24 billion in costs. Thisfigure, explained in the data in Table B, Chapter VI, relies on in-formation derived outside this study. These costs include incomelost because of illness and mortality and costs of supporting mentalhospitals and the criminal justice system.INDIRECT RELATIONSHIPSIn the last phase of this study, it was found that unemploymentand business failure rates are also related to such health risk fac-tors as alcohol and cigarette consumption and to the proportion ofthe population living alone. These health risk factors themselveshave been shown, in this study, to be related to several of themeasures of pathology. The implication is that recession has indi-rect effects on the pathologies, as well as the direct effects reportedabove. Experiments indicate that these indirect effects may be sub-stantial. For example, the indirect effects of recession on total mor-tality may be nearly double the direct effects associated with to theunemployment rate. These experimental results indicate that itwill be important for future research to focus on the interactionsbetween economic change, health risk factors, and social patholo-gies. Such research should permit more precise estimates of theoverall relationship between economic change and social pathologyto be made.2. Comparison with the 1976 ReportThe present work corroborates the major results of the 1976study: (1) real per capita income growth is strongly associated withdecline in mortality, and (2) recession continues to be related to in-creased pathology in the areas of mental and physical illness andcriminal aggression.Thus, in the current report, the basic findings on the beneficialimpact of long-term economic growth are reaffirmed. The overallmortality rate for all ages, both sexes, and the two major racialgroups continues to decrease in relation to long-term increases inreal per capital income. Similarly, the importance of the relation-ship between recession and social pathology can be seen in virtual-ly all the indices of mental and physical illness and criminal activi-ty. The present study re-emphasizes that the unemployment rate isthe most reliable indicator of recession-related injury. It is evident,however, that business failure rates and declines in labor force par-ticipation rates play substantial roles. The 1976 study found thatthe basic relationships between recession and pathological meas-ures can take place within a 6-year period. The present study finds 5that pathological implications of recession may produce results forat least another decade.3. Agreement with Other Research FindingsThe current report confirms results obtained by other research-ers which show that individuals of lower socioeconomic status havea high incidence of illness, accidents, and mortality. Psychologicaldisturbances and reported illegal behavior are also more prevalentin low-income than in higher socioeconomic groups.Findings in the current report are consistent with research thathas compared populations by age and major cause of death with re-spect to socioeconomic differences. Furthermore, the findings re-ported are consistent with epidemiological literature, which hasshown that cigarette consumption, immoderate alcohol consump-tion, fat consumption, and social isolation are signficant healthrisks. The recent study also supports research that shows organicchemical toxins to be health risks and illegal drug activity to be amajor factor in many different types of crime, especially homicide.USEFULNESS FOR SOCIAL POLICYThe purpose of this study was to conduct research on the possiblepathological effects of unemployment and other forms of nationaleconomic distress and to present the findings in a form that willprovide useful information for debate on national economic policy.This reporting of the basic statistical relationships between meas-ures of economic activity and measures of social pathology is in-tended as an early step in the development of a social accountingsystem that is useful in the assessment of public policy.This study offers statistical support for the thesis that actions in-fluencing national economic activity have a significant, if not cen-tral, influence on physical and mental health and criminal activity.Economic policy decisions, therefore, can be argued to have a sub-stantial effect on many aspects of societal health and well-being.Policy implications of these analyses can be developed from un-derstanding both the beneficial and detrimental social consequenc-es of changes in economic conditions. Economic measures in thisstudy were selected with specific reference to policy, includingsome which capture long-term growth trends and changes in thewell-being of individuals, and others which portray the capacity ofthe economy to provide employment to those who seek it.The pathological indices were also chosen for their significanceto policymaking. They are measures of fundamental human unhap-piness and non-well-being. Mortality rates are measures of thechanging life span. Suicide and mental hospital admission rates areexpressions of mental health disorders. Imprisonment and homi-cide are expressions of acute forms of human aggression. It wouldbe imprudent to disregard social pathologies associated with factorsthat stem from economic policy. It is clear that the social costs as-sociated with national economic decisions may be substantial.29-726 0-84-2 6FURTHER AREAS OF STUDYWe have found statistically reliable relationships between eco-nomic growth and long-term improvements in the nation's healthand life span. Similarly, we know that recession is related to signif-icant deteriorations in physical health, mental health, and to crimi-nal justice problems. The findings are consistent with comparativeresearch based on both individuals and large populations whichshow increases in health and social problems and decreased lifespan in groups of low socioeconomic status.The quantitative estimates derived in this study express only av-erage population response patterns across time. It would be usefulto estimate these relationships at somewhat lower level of aggrega-tion, because conditions can vary greatly by geographic region andurban centers. Different industrial and occupational groups arevery differently affected by national recessions and structural eco-nomic changes. The responses of certain populations to adverseconditions may be modified by state and local government ap-proaches aimed at ameliorating detrimental social consequences tolocal groups. High priority should be given to study of those popu-lation groups which have been affected by economic change wellbeyond national averages, analyzing what happens to individuals ifpossible. Furthermore, it is important to compare relationshipsfound in the United States to those in other industrialized coun-tries, as a means of gathering information about those social poli-cies that are effective in mitigating the adverse consequences ofchange.At the level of individual analysis, it would be especially usefulto know more about the dynamics of job-related stress experiencedby workers during periods of economic crisis or uncertainty. Surveystudies of populations experiencing sharp economic fluctuationscould reveal important information about the effects of fluctuationson physical and mental health and potential for criminal behavior.The emphasis on large national population samples is necessary inorder to examine severe but less frequent conditions and for thestatistical control of traditional risk factors. II. OVERVIEWSETTING THE PROBLEMSevere disturbances to the economies of industrial nations duringthe past decade have raised the issue of the relationship of a grow-ing and stable economy to health and social well-being. To whatextent can national well-being be damaged, or at least fail to im-prove, in a climate of extraordinarily high rates of unemploymentand inflation, structural decline in manufacturing employment,and increased regional disparities in wealth and economic develop-ment?Epidemiologic observations have consistently demonstrated thatdifferential mortality and morbidity rates are related to socioeco-nomic status at the individual level (1), to gross national product atthe national level (2, 3), and to high rates of unemployment and ofworkers earning low income in county and metropolitan areas(4, 5). As national economic growth declines, mortality rates in-crease. Conversely, it has been documented for various periods inthe United States (6) and other industrialized countries (4, 7) thatthe mortality rate declines following long-term economic growth.In the fall of 1976, the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S.Congress published a study of the impact of economic change onlevels of mental and physical health and criminal aggression (8).This study, using measures of economic growth, inflation, and un-employment, showed consistent statistical associations between in-creases in unemployment rates and increases in measures of socialpathologies. Considerable other research has shown the associationbetween unemployment and risks to physical and mental health(9-13), as well as to increased rates of imprisonment (14).The objective of the current study is to indicate a potentialimpact of national economic policies on major social problems, in-cluding a decline in mental and physical health and an increase inillegal activity. In order to estimate the national importance offacts known only through small samples based on individuals or onspecific regions, data from large national samples would be appro-priate. Large samples would also assure that relatively infrequentconditions such as death and severe illness are accounted for, andthat controls can be developed for those risk factors that affect so-cietal problems independently of economic policies.Since large national samples were not available, we used a two-step approach. In the first step, research findings and scientific for-mulations developed at individual and regional levels of analysisare brought together and applied to the national level. In thesecond step, the national-level analysis is designed so that it ac-counts for the short-, medium-, and long-term implications of eco-nomic changes.(7) 8THE MAJOR HYPOTHESESThe Economic Change Model of Pathology was designed by theauthor to account for the impact of changes in the economy onphysical and mental health and illegal activity. The model has fivebasic elements: long-term economic growth, economic instability,economic inequality, factors associated with economic growthwhich pose risks to health, and random shocks.1. Long-Term Economic GrowthBy making available increased resources or wealth per capita,long-term growth fosters social well-being and increases in lifespan. Such growth spurs societal investments in new knowledge(for example, concerning medical care) and in education of the pop-ulation. It also provides the basis for improved working conditions,including the development of health and safety measures, and forincreases and improvements in leisure and social insurance.2. Economic InstabilityEconomic instability encompasses recession and structural eco-nomic changes that are damaging to certain groups in society. Intimes of economic instability, loss of employment and income occurwith unusual frequency. Economic instability is marked, therefore,by high rates of unemployment and business failures and by de-clines in labor force participation and declining returns to invest-ment for the individuals affected.Under these conditions, the income levels and socioeconomicstatus of certain individuals and groups are lowered. Downwardmobility, or the threat of it, and the attempt to re-establish socio-economic position frequently involve considerable psychologicaland economic harm to the people involved. Employees of firmswhose existence is threatened because of significant economiclosses are also adversely affected.3. Economic InequalityEconomic inequality relates to the distribution of the product ofeconomic development. For reasons which usually depend on struc-tural change in the economy or on social custom, specific groupsmay not gain-or may actually experience loss-while the rest ofthe population takes part in the process of economic growth.4. Health Risk FactorsEconomic growth may alter consumption and production activityin ways that are deleterious to health. Examples are immoderatealcohol consumption, abuse of prescription or illicit drugs, cigarettesmoking, regular consumption of foods that are high in fat content,environmental contamination with chemical toxins, and substan-tial increases in the number of motor vehicles in the population.Another problem linked to growth is social isolation: divorce or sol-itary living arrangements may also impair health. 95. Random ShocksRandom shocks are disturbances in the natural or social environ-ment that have the potential to damage a population's well-being.These include disasters such as floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, epi-demics, internal political or economic disturbances, and rapid de-mographic changes.DERIVED HYPOTHESESThe principal hypotheses which are derived from the EconomicChange Model of Pathology are as follows: (1) economic instability,economic inequality, special risk factors associated with economicgrowth, and random shocks are detrimental to a population'shealth and social well-being; (2) conversely, economic stability,some measure of increased economic equality, minimization ofrisks associated with economic growth, and the absence or controlof random shocks coincide with trends fundamentally beneficial toa population's health and social well-being.Specific hypotheses which can be derived from this generalframework include: (1) as long-term economic growth increases,overall mortality rates decrease; (2) as the unemployment rate in-creases, mortality rates increase and the incidence of social patho-logies is greater; (3) as labor force participation and average hoursworked in manufacturing industries decrease over the short run,mortality and social pathology rates increase; (4) as the businessfailure, rate increases, the mortality rate increases and individualhealth and well-being decline.The major hypotheses are discussed in more detail in ChapterIV.SELECTION OF MEASURESThe purpose of this study is to translate research findings onbeneficial and pathological effects of economic growth and reces-sion into a form that is useful in assessing national economic policydecisions. The underlying analysis relates several measures ofsocial pathology to major indices of economic stress.We cannot offer overall estimates of the relationship betweeneconomic change and mental health, physical health, or aggression.To do this we would need to take into consideration the extent oftotal morbidity (in the cases of mental and physical health) and thetotal incidence of aggression in society (in the case of illegal activi-ty). Date on the incidence of general illness which could be appro-priately used for this study have never been available, nor have wehad any but the barest and most questionably reliable data withwhich to estimate criminal behavior. We are therefore unable tomeasure the totality of the phenomena directly, but must insteadrely on estimates from a variety of indirect sources.1. Measures of Social PathologyMeasures of social pathology, which represent fundamental as-pects of well-being, were chosen for their policy significance.Trends in the overall mortality rate are measures of the changinglife span. Cirrhosis and cardiovascular-renal disease mortality rates 10are negative measures of the physical health of the population. Thesuicide rate and mental hospital admission rate are negativemental health measures. Measures of the incidence of criminal ag-gression reflect disturbances in the social environment.A. GENERAL HEALTH MEASURESi. The total mortality rate, specified by age, sex, and raceii. The cardiovascular-renal disease mortality rate, by age andsexiii. The cirrhosis mortality rate, by age and sexWe face a complicated problem in measuring changes in the na-tion's health status. There appear to be no uniformly gathered esti-mates of health status over sufficiently long periods of time topermit comparisons with changes in the state of the economy.Moreover, those estimates which do exist have not kept pace withmedical diagnostic criteria of ill health. We are therefore limited inour estimates to the most severe indication of ill health-mortality.The advantages of using mortality as an index substantially out-weigh the disadvantages. Those states which have registered deathssince 1900 provide reliable estimates of the rate of death over time.In fact, mortality data are the "hardest" demographic data avail-able for use in the biological and social sciences. Furthermore,these data can be compared according to the specific components ofage, sex, and race, thereby providing comparisons of the reactionsof certain groups to environmental changes. Finally, the data onthe causes of death are reasonably reliable for large categoriessuch as cardiovascular-renal disease or infectious diseases. Thesedata are available for many different countries; they are also avail-able from each U.S. state, allowing comparison with estimates forthe country as a whole.Perhaps the major disadvantage of using mortality as a nationalhealth index is that, over the last several decades, increased lifespan has been associated with a greater probability of morbiditydue to chronic diseases (25).B. MENTAL HEALTH MEASURESi. Rate of admission to psychiatric hospitals, by ageii. The suicide rate, by ageiii. The cirrhosis mortality rate, by age and sexWe do not measure the national "mental health level" directlyby using these three measures to reflect changes in the overallmental health of the population. Rather, we assume that, by usingthe combined estimates obtained, we can infer (imperfectly, weadmit) changes in the overall mental health status of the popula-tion. In doing so, however, we rely on measurements of the mostextreme behavior for which society keeps a continuous record.One example of the use of data on extreme behavior is our utili-zation of the rate of admissions to mental hospitals over time toindicate changes in the overall mental health level of the popula-tion. Such a procedure has the disadvantage of being somewhatconfounded by administrative problems related to the hospitaliza-tion of the mentally ill (for example, admissions policies in hospi- 11tals with limited space and numerous applicants). It has the advan-tage, on the other hand, of representing a relatively severe indica-tion of change as well as the tolerance of the population for seriousmental disturbance.Related measures such as suicide rates and cirrhosis mortalityrates are used to supplement data on mental hospital admissions.(Cirrhosis is also used as an indicator of physical health.) The sui-cide rate is indicative of severe mental distress. Fluctuations in theincidence of cirrhosis-related deaths would indicate the extent ofsevere alcohol abuse. If the relationship between mental hospitaladmissions and changes in the economy accurately reflects the ef-fects of the economy on societal stress, we should obtain similarfindings for suicide and cirrhosis-related deaths. The mental hospi-tal admission rate may be more generally reflective of the overalllevel of societal mental distress, however, because suicide and cir-rhosis are infrequent compared with hospitalization for mental ill-ness.Among the mental health measures, therefore, we have selectedthose which represent intellectual and affective disturbance, inabil-ity on the part of the family and community to deal with mentaldisorders outside the institutional setting, and the use of psycho-tropic substances to alleviate mental health trauma. These meas-ures cover, conceptually, a number of broad mental health prob-lems and, taken together, generally reflect the overall mentalhealth of the population.C. MEASURES OF CRIMINAL AGGRESSIONi. The rate of imprisonment in state prisonsii. The rate of arrests, by ageiii. The major crimes known to police, by typeEstimating changes in the incidence of criminal aggression is atleast as difficult as obtaining comprehensive indices for mental andphysical health.Imprisonment is used as an index of extreme forms of societalaggression, an indication of criminal behavior serious enough towarrant incarceration by the state for the protection of the public.As an indicator of societal aggressions, imprisonment has the dis-advantage also of being influenced by changing standards of crimi-nal correction, the effects of plea bargaining, and public financeconsiderations. Although imprisonment is a relatively indirectmeasure of the extent of aggression within society, it is neverthe-less fairly reliable as a measure of the presence of societal aggres-sion.Measures of criminal activity drawn from criminal justicesources include the rate of arrests for all offenses, ranging fromrelatively minor charges such as drunkenness to serious crimes ofaggression and violence. Narcotics arrests are singled out for par-ticular attention because of the overall damage to social health andwell-being represented by illegal narcotic activity. Arrests for em-bezzlement and fraud, as a measure of overall white collar crime,have been thoroughly analyzed because of their extraordinary mon-etary cost to society. Moving closer to the actual incidence of crimi-nal behavior, we examine the rate of crimes reported to police for 12six of the serious offenses: assault, burglary, larceny, robbery, rape,and automobile theft.Homicide is used as a supplementary measure of aggression. It isdrawn from vital statistics rather than from criminal justicesources, and therefore does not depend on the criminal justice re-porting system. In the same way that suicide and cirrhosis mortali-ty rates lend validity to mental hospital admission estimates ofmental health, homicide rates serve as a supplementary measureto rates of imprisonment as an indication of change in the extentof aggression in American society. Both homicide and imprison-ment have shown patterns similar to those of mental health meas-ures in relation to disturbances in the economic environment.In each of the topic areas in which social measures have been se-lected-physical health, mental health, and illegal activity and ag-gression-key policy issues are involved. This study provides statis-tical evidence for each of these measures, of direct and indirect re-lationships to national economic policies, which bears attention. Inmany instances, national economic changes are linked to socialproblems that have entailed considerable expense to society.2. Economic MeasuresEconomic measures were chosen for their relevance to bothpolicy and to theories of how economic factors may influence path-ological phenomena. Furthermore, economic measures distinguishbetween trends in long-term economic growth and short-term, orcyclical, fluctuations.A. MEASUREMENT OF LONG-TERM GROWTH TRENDSi. Growth of per capita incomeThe most significant measure of economic growth, the trend' inper capita income, is related directly to the material well-being ofindividuals. In estimating the exponential trend in "real" growth,we take into account the rate of inflation.B. MEASUREMENT OF CYCLICAL FLUCTUATIONSi. The unemployment rate, by age and sexii. Short-term declines in labor force participation and in hoursworked in manufacturing industriesiii. The business failure rateThese measures were selected to portray the capacity of the econ-omy to provide employment to those who seek it. The principalindex is the unemployment rate, a key measure of cyclical changesin the economy. In both the 1976 report and the current study, thismeasure is interpreted as a multidimensional measure of stress, in-dicating loss of work, loss of income, and damage to self-esteem andsocial relationships. In many cases we found it useful to specify un-' The "pure" trend element of long-term economic growth tends to have an exponential form.We therefore fit an exponential trend to the real per capita income, thus eliminating the cycli-cal component, which is measured by the variables discussed in the section on cyclical fluctua-tions. 13employment rates by age and sex, rather than use the total unem-ployment rate.The 1976 study used only the unemployment rate in estimatingeffects of recession, a factor which may have served to understatethe overall pathological implications. In the present study, addi-tional measures of recession are used to capture the widespreadnature of the current economic stress. For example, the measure-ment of short-term declines in labor force participation documentsthe activity-of persons who have dropped out of the labor force be-cause of retirement or discouragement. The rate of business fail-ures is another powerful indicator of recession which depicts theeconomic impact particularly on members of the middle class.Although we now have several indices with which to measurethe adverse impact of periods of economic instability on individualhealth and well-being, we still lack a totally comprehensive meas-ure of cyclical effects.How To VIEW RESULTSThe statistical analyses performed for this study identify rela-tionships between economic and social measures. They cannot beused to demonstrate causality. The results only establish that cer-tain factors vary in similar fashion and appear to be statisticallylinked.In the present study, tests for the statistical significance of find-ings are routinely performed to reduce the possibility that the rela-tionships occur by chance (Tables I-III and Appendix Tables 1-33).Also of relevance is how systematically the same results are foundamong sub-populations of the study sample. Consistent sets of rela-tions by age group and sex, by cause of death, and by category ofmental hospitalization and crime are reported in detail in ChapterV. These results are in agreement with those of other studies(Chapter III), and, in general, our theoretical expectations aboutthe relationships between economic change and social pathologyare borne out by the findings (Chapters III and IV).Returning to the issue of causality, it is possible that various un-identified external phenomena are responsible for the changesbeing observed between the factors. In this case, economic andsocial factors could be jointly related to other, unobserved factorswhich produce the results. Our research cannot rule out this possi-bility.We can, however, examine whether some external factors whichare influenced by economic conditions-such as alcohol, cigarette,and fat consumption per capita, and social isolation-also influencehealth. If such risks to health are taken into account, are the samerelations between economic conditions and health and social well-being still observed? We have found that, controlling for these fac-tors, the relations between economic conditions and measures ofhealth and well-being are usually strengthened rather than weak-ened.We conclude, therefore, that although they do not prove the ex-istence of causal relationships, our findings provide considerablestatistical support for the hypothesis that economic recession is re-lated to adverse change in national health and well-being. 14To interpret the study's results properly it is necessary to under-stand that aggregate data are being used. This presents a minimalproblem in the case of relations based on "simple" factors, whichhave one meaning for both the individual and the entire popula-tion. Such simple factors include per capita alcohol, cigarette, andanimal fat consumption. Compound factors such as economic insta-bility are multidimensional and are measured by several variableswhich have different implications for different individuals-incomeloss, employment loss, increased work stress, home foreclosure, andforced migration. During a period of national economic instability,individuals will not experience the same types or same combina-tions of adverse circumstances. Thus, the measures of economic in-stability-rates of unemployment, labor force participation, andbusiness failures-represent more than they measure directly.Lag StructureWe find that increases in mortality rates, mental pathology indi-ces, and criminal justice indices can be observed within a 6-yearperiod during and after recession. Based on previous research inthe United States and other industrialized countries, we expected,and found, that there are two characteristic peaks in the relation-ships within that 6-year lag period. The first of these peaks occursduring the first year of the recession and presumably reflects: (1)sharp psychological reactions to substantial economic loss, such ascan be seen in the suicide rate, in the mortality rates of highly vul-nerable populations, and in criminal justice indices, and (2) declinein nutrition and use of medical care, which can affect infant mor-tality and mortality among the chronically ill.The second peak typically occurs 2 to 3 years after a recession (asmeasured at the highest level of the unemployment or businessfailure rates). Though chronic disease (especially cardiovasculardisease) mortality is especially involved, nearly all sources of ill-ness and social pathology are implicated. The 2- to 3-year peak re-flects a period of continued economic loss for the population thatloses socioeconomic status as a result of recession. This sequencecan be observed by examining standard economic indicators.The 6-year interval of increased mortality associated with reces-sion is understood to reflect, in part, increases in the incidence orseverity of chronic illnesses which in some instances result in mor-tality. It is assumed, however, that most persons whose ill health isaggravated by recession do not die within a 6-year period of reces-sion. Rather, the seriously ill population becomes more vulnerableto mortality over at least the subsequent decade. With total andchronic disease mortality, therefore, we find relationships betweenrecession and mortality over a 16-year period.RESULTSIn this section as throughout this report, expressions such as "re-lated to" or "associated with" are used to mean that statisticallysignificant relations were found between measures of economicchange or health risk factors and social pathologies-without infer-ences to the cause and effect of the relationships. 15The principal findings of this study reflect the premises of ourgeneral model. Specifically, the long-term trend of economic growthhas a beneficial association with total mortality for all ages, par-ticularly with respect to cardiovascular disease and suicide. Eco-nomic instability, as measured by the unemployment rate, has anadverse relation to total mortality at all ages, with lags under 5years and usually over a period of 7 to 15 years. The same patternof statistical relationships is reflected in the findings for cardiovas-cular diseases (especially ischemic heart and cerebrovascular dis-ease) and cirrhosis of the liver. Suicide is related to unemploymentwith lags under 2 years, as is homicide for children of both sexes atages 1 to 4 (probably reflecting child abuse) and for women overthe age of 45. Imprisonment, arrest rates in all age groups, and se-rious crimes reported to the police are all associated with increasedunemployment rates within a period of 6 years.Business failure rates, a second measure of economic instability,are strongly related to mortality in persons over the age of 55 withlags of under 3 years. Cardiovascular mortality rates show this re-lationship even more clearly (especially at younger ages), and evenwithin 1 year, similar relationships are observed for suicide ratesof middle-aged groups. Decline in labor force participation, anothermeasure of economic instability, is associated, within a year, withincreased mortality of infants and of the population aged 20 to 24and over 55. Declines in labor force participation by women are re-lated to suicide rates of women over the age of 35.Economic inequality, as measured by the discrepancy betweenunemployment of specific population groups and that of the popula-tion at large, is related to homicide, mental hospital admissions,and imprisonment. Regarding homicide, the ratio of youth unem-ployment to total unemployment is an especially prominent factor.The ratio of unemployed persons over age 65 to total unemploy-ment is an important factor in psychiatric hospitalization, whilethe non-white unemployment ratio bears a strong relation to stateprison and state mental hospital admissions.Other variables have also been found to be related to measuresof health and social well-being. Alcohol consumption per capita isrelated to virtually all the measures of pathology. It is necessary,however, to consider the principal beverages separately: for exam-ple, beer consumption per capita is clearly related to decreases incardiovascular mortality, especially in ischemic heart disease mor-tality. On the other hand, cigarette consumption per capita is uni-formly related to increased mortality in persons over the age of 35and in infants, and for all diagnostic categories of cardiovasculardisease. Social isolation, as indicated by the divorce rate and by theproportion of the population living alone, is related to increases inmortality in several age groups as well as suicide, mental hospitaladmissions, and officially recorded criminal activity.The relationships between economic changes and measures of so-cietal pathology are discussed in Chapter V and are presented indetail in Tables I-IV and the Appendix Tables. Although the analy-ses are based on relationships during the years 1950-1980, approxi-mately, we can estimate their quantitative implications for specificrecessions. In Table A we estimate the relations of specific econom- 16ic indices to measures of social pathology for the recession begin-ning in 1973-1974.TABLE A.-ESTIMATED IMPACT, OF A 14.3 PERCENT INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, 3PERCENT DECLINE IN TREND PER CAPITA INCOME, 5.5 PERCENT INCREASE IN BUSINESS FAILURERATE, 200 PERCENT INCREASE IN ANNUAL CHANGE IN BUSINESS FAILURE RATE[All actual changes between 1973 and 1974 2]Increase in stress incidence related toRise in Fall in real income Rise in business Rise in annual Rise in ratio ofunemployment rate trend failure rate change in unemploymentbusiness failure rate of males inSecial .... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~rate age group t6-Social stress indicator rate 24 to totalNum Pe- unemploymnentNumber Percent Number Percent ber cent Number Per- ratecent Num- Per-ber centTotal mortality.............................................. 45,936 (2.3) 59,996 (3.0) 2,682 (0.1)Cardiovascular mortality............................... 28,510 (2.8) 45,189 (4.4). 95,660 (9.0) .Cirrhosis mortality........................................ 430 (1.4) 806 (2.7) .Suicide......................................................... 27 0 (0.98 ) 320 (1.1).Population in mental hospitals ................. 8,416 (6.0) .Total arrests ................................................. 577,477 (6.0) .Arrests for fraud and embezzlement ............ 11,552 (4.8) .Assaults reported to police ................. 7,035 (1.1) .Homicide 3 ...................................... .. 403 (1.7)' Direct effects only; estimates of indirect effects are discussed in Chapter V.2 Equations based on the years 1950-1980.3 Homicide figures refer to change of 9 percent in the youth unemployment ratio between 1978 and 1979.Note: Figures in parenthesis indicate percent of total stress incidence.Between 1973 and 1974, the beginning of a national recession,the unemployment rate increased by 14.3 percent, the trend in realper capita income fell by 3.0 percent, the business failure rate in-creased by 5.5 percent, and the annual change in the business fail-ure rate increased by 200 percent. In Table A, the social implica-tions of these economic changes are estimated for total mortality;mortality due to cardiovascular diseases, liver cirrhosis, suicide,and homicide; mental hospital admission rates; and criminal indi-ces which include the total arrest rate, the rate of arrests for fraudand embezzlement (white collar crime), and the rate of assaultsknown to police.In the case of total and chronic disease mortality-cardiovascularand cirrhosis mortality-the unemployment impact is estimatedwithin a 16-year period. For all other indices of social trauma theunemployment impact is estimated within a 6-year period. The in-crease in social trauma associated with the decline in the real percapita income trend is estimated within 1 year; that of increasedbusiness failure rates and annual changes in business failure ratesis estimated within a 3-year period. Table A shows, for example,that the increased unemployment rate is related to: an increase of45,936 deaths (or 2.3 percent) within a 16-year period. The percapita income trend decline is related to an increase of 59,996deaths (or 3.0 percent) within 1 year. The increase in business fail-ures is related to an increase of 2,682 deaths (or .10 percent) within3 years.Table B provides dollar costs associated with the changes in un-employment rates, trend of real per capita income, and business 17failure rates during 1973-74. Table B is derived from calculationsin Table A of the percentage of changes in social pathologies thatare linked to changes in the economic indices. The social patholo-gies are taken as indicators of more general societal problems.Thus, total mortality serves as an indicator of total illness; cardio-vascular mortality indicates morbidity due to circulatory systemdisease; arrests for fraud and embezzlement indicate white collarcrime, etc. The economic costs of the societal problems, indirectlymeasured by the social pathology indicators, have been derivedfrom independent studies discussed in detail in Chapter VI. Thoseeconomic costs are multiplied by the percentage changes in socialpathologies related to economic conditions to produce the economiclosses of the 1973-74 economic changes reported in Table B.TABLE B.-ECONOMIC LOSS IN MILLIONS OF 1980 DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH 1 A 14.3 PERCENTINCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT, 3 PERCENT DECLINE IN TREND PER CAPITA INCOME, 200 PERCENTINCREASE IN ANNUAL CHANGE IN BUSINESS FAILURE RATE 2[All actual changes between 1973 and 1974 ']Economic loss related toRise inratio ofRise in onenmploy-Social stress indicator Representing econmic cost of Riem i oll in per annal of rals tmentmptoi inom in age Totalmerae trend failure ~ orte totalunemploy-ment rateTotal mortality4.............................

The "indirect effects," which are based on the influence ofrecession on these control factors, and, subsequently, on health andcriminal activity, have been studied experimentally. The experi-mental results indicate that the indirect effects of recession areprobably much greater than the direct effects of the unemploymentrate (see Chapter V on Indirect Effects). 18SOCIAL COSTS AND SOCIAL POLICYThis report deals with the basic relationships between nationaleconomic conditions and measures of social pathology. If these find-ings are to be of use to policy makers, they need to be translatedinto the costs associated with changes in social pathologies.If the intent of national policy making is to bypass concerns ofslow economic growth, instability and recession in favor of long-term economic prosperity, then the following should be considered.First, whatever the success of long-term policy, if current economicgrowth is damaged, or recession is deepened or prolonged, one canbe reasonably confident of substantial social costs. If the long-termapproach turns out to be correct, then there may be net socialgains over the long term, but there will also have been sacrificesborne by specific populations in the short run. On the other hand,if long-term policy is incorrect, then it is possible that the costsbased on current considerations will not be offset; indeed, it islikely that they will be increased.If policymakers consider that long-term economic policy will, infact, override current costs and benefits, the results of the presentstudy emphasize the need for caution, for several reasons. First,there is no consensus among the leaders of the economics profes-sion regarding the appropriate path toward sustained prosperity.Second, the existing models of national economic behavior arerarely precise in forecasting beyond the short term-a year or twointo the future. Third, because of domestic and international politi-cal considerations, it is not certain that resulting economic policyformulations will have the anticipated effects. Such uncertaintiesabout long-term economic policy planning make it clear that over-riding short-term economic considerations may incur substantialcosts to society.Beyond the promotion of real economic growth and curbing of re-cession, the Economic Change Model of Pathology presented in thisreport is applicable to other types of social policy. It is generallyassumed that severe economic inequality and structural unemploy-ment are undesirable. The data of this report substantiate those as-sumptions by showing that economic inequality is related to poorphysical and mental health and to increased criminal activity.Structural unemployment-especially of youth-is associated withmental health and criminal justice problems.Our information on government spending for social programs in-dicates that government spending on Aid to Families with Depend-ent Children (AFDC) is significantly related to declines in mortalityof infants and 1- to 4-year-olds. It is also possible to infer some ofthe effects of diminished social welfare spending during recession.We observe that health problems of many different types, rangingfrom infant mortality to chronic diseases and mental health, sub-stantially increase during periods of economic recession. Somewould argue that a period of recession is therefore a period duringwhich it is most urgent to debate increased supplements to income,nutrition, and health care.Table B summarizes specific social costs in monetary terms.More specific discussions of these data can be found in Chapter VI. 19REFERENCES1.

HISTORICAL BASIS OF THE MODELINTRODUCTIONProbably no subject in social epidemiology has been as long andthoroughly studied as the relationship between socioeconomicstatus and health (29, 149, 150). Until very recently, the bulk of re-search in this area has been concerned with establishing a strongstatistically significant relationship between low socioeconomicstatus and mental and physical disorders. A high incidence of phys-ical and mental pathologies has been found in groups with low so-cioeconomic status.Given the consistent findings of the substantial literature at theindividual level, research turned to a specific measurement of thedistribution of illnesses in the population. Higher morbidity andmortality rates and higher incidence of ill health were identified inlow socioeconomic groups that included nonwhites and the elderly.Mental disorders such as schizophrenia occurred with the highestfrequency in the low socioeconomic groups. Furthermore, there isevidence of a relationship between socioeconomic status and report-ed crime, although this association is less satisfactorily worked outthan others.To understand the dynamic relationship between economic levelsand health, further advances were required in research design.Specifically, it was necessary to demonstrate with a certain level ofstatistical probability that a change in health status would follow achange in the economic status of a person or population. To facili-tate this end, researchers began to look at the variables in the con-text of nations or large aggregate groups in order to identify thedynamics involved and the relationships between them.INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUSa. Epidemiology of IllnessImportant social epidemiological studies in the United Stateshave long provided evidence of the relationship between low socio-economic status and pathology. The conclusion was that socioeco-nomic status per se, rather than residential area or ecologicalniche, was the crucial variable in social deviance in general, and inphysical and mental pathology specifically (147, pp. 28-29).Further research on the subject of individual and economicchange has shown consistently that groups of low socioeconomicstatus exhibit a high incidence of mental and physical disordersand criminal aggression. These include higher rates of morbidityand mortality due to ill health (23-39); a large number of mentaldisorders (40-56); and a high incidence of illegal activity (143).When the welfare state was introduced in Britain after WorldWar II, income distribution was equalized to some extent, and(20) 21social and medical services were made more available. Neverthe-less, substantial differences in disease patterns continued to existamong the socioeconomic groups in that country. Indeed, overallmortality rates have continued to be high for the lower socioeco-nomic groups, both in Britain and the United States (29), since thattime. In the United States, moreover, the infant mortality rate andthe communicable disease death rate for white infants have de-clined far more sharply than have those for non-whites (30); thesharp declines seem to be due, in part, to difference in income andeducation.In the United States, the comparatively poor disease patterns oflow socioeconomic groups and non-whites have been most evidentin chronic conditions as reported in the National Health Survey(31). Hypertension (32) and cancer of the lung, cervix, stomach, andesophagus (23) are among the principal chronic diseases related tolow socioeconomic status.The high morbidity and mortality rates of individuals of low so-cioeconomic status can also be observed among the elderly. Thenumber and severity of disabilities for older persons in the lowersocial classes is high, and, largely for these reasons, fewer of themcontinue to work after the age of retirement. The lack of food andrelatively poor preparation of food among the lower-class elderlyhave been documented, as have inadequate housing, housekeepingservices, and nursing care (38,39).b. Health Care UtilizationSeriously compounding the problem of higher rates of severe ill-ness and mortality among lower socioeconomic groups is that theytend to delay more than their counterparts in higher socioeconomicgroups in seeking medical care. Numerous studies show that peoplewith low incomes tend to seek physicians' services in hospitalemergency rooms and clinics, presumably because their illnesseshave reached emergency conditions or because they have had noregular source of primary physician care (69, 79, 85, 88-89, 94-95,98, 101, 105, 107-109). People with the lowest incomes have thelowest rates of surgery (68-69, 72-74). High-income groups are morelikely to use preventive services, especially children of high-incomefamilies (67, 68, 73, 76, 78, 84, 89, 90, 101-102, 105, 108, 110-114). Inaddition, high-income persons use more services of specialists (69,82, 94-96, 99, 101, 108) and seek more preventive services from den-tists than do low-income persons (88, 101, 103, 115).Traditionally, research has indicated that low-income groups usephysicians' services and are admitted to hospitals less often thanhigh-income groups. These relationships are being reversed, howev-er, because of the growth of health insurance and financing pro-grams for the poor (67-106). Low-income persons still stay in thehospital on average longer than high-income persons, probably in-dicating greater rates of severe illness (68-69, 71-74, 79-83, 86, 88,91, 93-94, 96, 99, 100, 103, 105-106, 116), but both high- and low-income groups seek physicians' services for serious illness at simi-lar rates (68-69, 84, 108-109, 117-118).Poor health care and related practices appear to be closely con-nected with morbidity and mortality patterns. In Britain, low-29-726 0-84-3 22income groups have made less use than high-income groups of serv-ices to improve health, including hospitals (34), prevention and im-munization facilities, maternal and child health services, and die-tary supplements (35). Similar findings of disadvantage to thehealth of lower socioeconomic groups continue to be observed forthe United States. In the United States, in addition, the problem ofaccess to health care, both because of the absolute costs and the or-ganization of medical services, appears to have a more seriousimpact on low-income than on high-income persons (36-37).c. Mental DisordersMajor differences among socioeconomic groups are also found inthe case of mental disorders. Despite the many unsolved problemsof selecting reliable and valid indices for measuring mental disor-ders, every measure shows that lower socioeconomic status tends tobe highly correlated with poor mental health (40). Only a few stud-ies among a great many on this subject do not show a greater prev-alence of mental disorders in the lowest socioeconomic groups (41-42). The relationship between high rates of mental disorders andlow socioeconomic status holds regardless of whether the studiesused surveys of subjective reports of happiness, standard psychiat-ric inventories, psychiatric examinations, or interviews by psychia-trists (43-47). The findings are similar in studies involving the inci-dence of all types of psychiatric care (48) or first admissions tomental hospitals (49).The incidence of schizophrenia, especially in larger cities, occursmainly among low-income groups. The incidence of psychoneurosesand personality disorders is also prevalent among groups of low so-cioeconomic status. The distribution of the depressive disorders,however, may be unrelated to social class groupings (50-56).d. Social DisorganizationThe relationships between socioeconomic status and crime, delin-quency, family disorganization, and alcoholism have been workedout less satisfactorily. This is most likely due to the lack of precisemeasures in these areas of social pathology. Nevertheless, as wasnoted above, they tend to predominate in areas with low-incomepopulations. In addition, many studies indicate that lower-class in-dividuals run greater risks of being defined as criminal or delin-quent (57-59). Again, numerous studies indicate an inverse rela-tionship between socioeconomic status and divorce rates (60-62), de-sertion (62-64), and illegitimacy (65). Finally, there is substantialevidence of increases in heavy consumption of alcohol, and debili-tating problems related to such drinking, commensurate with de-creases in socioeconomic position (66).In the literature described above, there are no extant cohortstudies of living populations in which both the economic and healthconditions of individuals were measured through time. Rather,these studies described a point-in-time relationship between loweconomic status and relatively high morbidity and mortality ratesand contributing factors, such as utilization of health services. 23POPULATIONS AND THE OVERALL ECONOMYThe central value of macro-level studies of the influence of eco-nomic disturbances on health lies in their ability to gather infor-mation from large populations over both long and short time spans.The pre-eminent question of how important the health implicationsof economic change may be is answerable only by the macro study,since it is geared to estimate the impacts on the population of com-munities, cities, provinces, nations, and aggregates of nations. Themacro-level studies also allow us to study differences in responsesto economic disturbance according to culture, political system, eco-nomic system, and type of industrial development.Populations and Economic Development: A Static PictureEmpirical research testing the relationship between economicgrowth and health status depends on suitable data from compari-sons among populations at different levels of economic develop-ment-either for the same society over time or for different soci-eties. Such studies usually measure health levels by mortality-based indicators-crude death rates, infant mortality rates, or ex-pectation of life at birth. Recent analyses of death rates over vari-ous time spans in the 20th century in the U.S. (151) and Britain(152-153), for instance, show strong association between trends inincreased per capita income and decreased mortality rates for allcauses, infant deaths, and cardiovascular disease. Cross-sectionalstudies of samples of both industrial and developing countries cor-roborate results of the longitudinal studies. Levels of mortality de-cline and life expectancy rises with higher levels of income or GNP(154, pp. 1903-1905; 155).Preston's (155) analysis of 50 to 60 countries in the 20th centuryshows a relationship between increased per capita national incomeand increased life expectancy, with more gain in life expectancyper dollar income in the 1960s than in the 1930s or 1900s. Theresult illustrates an important characteristic of the basic associa-tion between health and economic change-the basic relationshipscan be found under many circumstances, but the strength, form,and conditions of the relationships are likely to vary with changesin time and place.Populations and Economic Change: A Dynamic PictureA. ECONOMIC HISTORIESStudies of the effects of economic adversity on mortality ratesbegan with the observation that after the 18th century in northernEurope, the mortality rate declined sharply (119). Furthermore, thedecline in mortality rates had been measurable long before the in-troduction of sanitation, large-scale quarantine methods for immi-grant groups, or medical technologies such as inoculation andchemical therapeutics, especially the sulfonamides. It is now gener-ally accepted that the extraordinary increase in life expectancythat occurred during the 18th century in northern Europe waslargely a function of the control over agricultural productivity(120-121). 24Major technical advances in agriculture, generally first attrib-uted to Britain, were observed to diminish the amplitudes of thecycles of abundance and famine which were known to be closely re-lated to the levels of mortality associated with major epidemic dis-eases and plague (120-121). Indeed, the 19th century in northernEurope saw a decline in mortality which resulted in both a dou-bling of the life span and an extremely sharp decrease in mortalityrates attributed to infectious diseases. The "industrialization" ofagriculture continued into the 20th century. In industrialized coun-tries, infectious diseases ceased to be a significant cause of mortali-ty in all age groups.B. INDUSTRIALIZED SOCIETY VERSUS DEVELOPING COUNTRYSo significant is the influence of economic development per se onmortality and morbidity levels that, on an international basis, themost significant source of life expectancy differentials is clearly re-lated to the level of economic development. In developing countries,mortality rates, especially infant mortality rates, are comparative-ly high, and diarrhea, respiratory illness, and infectious diseasesare mainly responsible for morbidity and mortality. In contrast, inindustrialized countries, the major sources of mortality are chronicdiseases and external causes (accidents, homicide, suicide) in theyounger age groups. The major changes in life expectancy and pat-terns of disease incidence reflect very long-term or secular changesin the productivity of the economy that are the result of industrial-ization in both agriculture and manufacturing (122).It has been suggested that the result of the transfer of publichealth and medical care measures from developed countries to cer-tain low-income countries is that survival is now more clearly sta-tistically dependent on social policies than on national income.Whatever importance the transfer of technical advances may have,however, it has not, it is argued, altered the basic income-healthrelationships (151-155).It must be noted that relating trends in economic indicators tohealth status is far more complex for industrialized countries. Inthe first place, the effects of long-term trends in national productiv-ity and income must be considered distinct from those of cyclicalchanges in the economies of countries where production and con-sumption patterns are not planned, i.e., non-socialist countries.Second, a major problem in analyzing the effects of economicchange on morbidity and mortality concerns the probability thatthe decline in health status will lag behind the decline in the na-tional economic indicator. A third concern involves the precisemechanisms whereby adverse changes in the economy may in-crease the population morbidity level. The methodological problemsare discussed in more detail in the Research Concerns section ofthis Chapter.Despite the differences in kinds of data and in methodologicalconsiderations, the empirical evidence strongly supports the rela-tionship between national economic indicators and health in indus-trialized countries (147). For both infectious diseases and infant andmaternal illnesses, strong relationships have been observed be-tween an increase in national economic growth and a decrease in 25mortality rates (135). The decrease in mortality due to the chronicdiseases has also been found to have a strong relationship to na-tional economic growth in industrialized countries (133-135); thesechronic diseases include heart, cerebrovascular, and renal diseaseswhich comprise the majority of sources of mortality in these coun-tries. Finally, increases in rates of hospitalization for mental disor-ders have been shown to be strongly related to adverse nationaleconomic fluctuations (e.g., unemployment rates), as have mortalitydue to cirrhosis of the liver, automobile accidents, and suicide andhomicide (129, 130, 139).C. POPULATIONS AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITYWith these findings as background, an additional series of stud-ies was undertaken over the last 5 years to determine the overalleffects of changes in the national economy on health status. Giventhe consistent findings of the substantial literature on the subject,there was reason to believe that declines in employment andincome, and increased inflation, would decrease the actual socioeco-nomic status of significant minorities of the general population.Those decreases in socioeconomic status, in turn, would lead to low-ered levels of nutrition, a substantial increase in social-psychologi-cal stress, and decreased financial access to medical care facilities.These three factors, originating in national economic instabilities,would then have a substantial negative impact on the health of thepopulation.Economic downturns have potentially damaging influence onhealth because they entail change for many members of a popula-tion and loss of social status for some, often those of the lowestsocial status. Most research on the health effects of business cycleshas analyzed national or state populations with mortality rates asthe measure of health levels. Recently, however, measures of mor-bidity and utilization of health services have become more fre-quent, especially in studies of mental disorder.Earlier analyses had dealt with mortality from all causes, infantmortality, suicide, and deaths resulting from heart disease and tu-berculosis (156-159). With the exception of tuberculosis, which overthe last 50 years has declined in importance as a cause of death inindustrial countries, these causes are still attracting the attentionof researchers. Later research followed the earlier work in demon-strating that unemployment rates are directly related to mortalityrates, with lags of 2 to 5 years, particularly when long-term eco-nomic growth is also controlled (160). But at the same time, an-other business cycle indicator, measuring the rapid pace of econom-ic growth, was also related directly to mortality.In periods of economic instability, economic loss and downwardmobility lead to expansion of the socioeconomic differentials. Thismeans socioeconomic status of some populations is lowered. Recentreports from Britain (161-162) and the U.S. (163-165) continue toshow a strong relationship between socioeconomic status and meas-ures of morbidity and mortality, often with a particularly large gapseparating the lowest social stratum from the rest of the popula-tion. 26Interpretation has typically focused on such intervening varia-bles as living environments, occupational hazards, nutritionalstatus, and access to health care. As economic growth has contrib-uted directly and indirectly to improvements in these conditions,even for the poorest, the data have been regularly tested for indica-tions of convergence of health status among groups of different so-cioeconomic status. Researchers in the U.S attempted to determinewhether improved economic conditions had elevated the healthstatus of the poor. Although convergence has been reported (149,164, 166-167), the gains are not necessarily maintained. In fact,there have recently been reports of absolute as well as relative de-terioration in the health status of lower socioeconomic groups (162)during periods of economic growth.RESULTS OF ECONOMIC CHANGEa. Loss of Resources and Psychological StressThe two principal ways in which adverse economic changes, spe-cifically unemployment, can affect health are, directly, through thereduction of material resources, and, indirectly, through psycholog-ical stress. Loss of resources is associated particularly with infec-tious disease and in fetal and infant health problems related to in-adequate nutrition, housing, and energy. In societies where accessto medical care is not universally guaranteed, reduction in incomewill lead to a decline in or postponement of, health care utilization.In the U.S. for instance, reduced access occurs with loss of healthinsurance benefits or health care benefits usually secured throughemployment. Stress related to unemployment may also act to de-press health care utilization, even where health care availability isin principle undiminished as a result of national policy.Psychological stress is generated in the unemployed, their de-pendents, and close associates through loss of social and economicposition, anxieties over the future, damage to social networks, andthe concurrent need to adapt to a new set of life circumstances.Psychological strains on persons employed in financially damagedfirms result from threats of loss of social or economic status andfrom work stress. It is, therefore, of some importance that studiesthat compare the unemployed and employed from the same firm orcommunity may occasionally find little difference between the twogroups.Psychological stress related to unemployment will result, theo-retically, in the same types of mental health problems that arestimulated by other major sources of stress (168)-transient reac-tions and personality disorders, clinical depression, aggression, andpsychotic episodes. Psychophysiological stress may also involve thecardiovascular, metabolic, reproductive, immune, or neurologicalsystems.b. Social Pathologies Associated with Economic ChangeIn the past 20 years, studies of the relationship of economicchange to morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries haveexamined effects on mental and physical disorders. The earlierwork, dealing with mental health problems, tended to emphasize 27the role that economic loss might play in causing stress. As atten-tion to physical health problems increased, it became apparent thatrecession itself also played a principal role. At present, it is recog-nized that loss of resources and psychological stress are not easy toseparate causally. The implication is that, in the vast majority ofpathologies, including mental and physical health and criminal ag-gression, some combination of resource loss and psychologicalstress is probably involved.HEALTH INDICES AND ECONOMIC CHANGE1. SuicideSuicide is the first indicator of mental pathology found to in-crease consistently with adverse changes in the economy (123-124).A number of researchers have replicated these findings, and theyattest to the severe stress that is brought about by economic reces-sion.2. Mental Hospital AdmissionsSince the 1930s, a number of researchers have attempted to dem-onstrate a relationship between adverse economic changes and in-creases in mental hospital admissions. Three recent studies of notehave demonstrated that the relationship can be measured consist-ently over time (125-127). The first of these studies dealt with Mas-sachusetts during the 1930s, the second with the whole UnitedStates during the Depression, and the third with New York Statefor the period 1841-1967. It was demonstrated that, during each ofthe recessions since 1841, the number of both first admissions andreadmission to mental hospitals increased substantially. Cyclicalchanges in the economy were the single most important factor intrends of admission to mental hospitals. The New York State studywas replicated for the entire United States and for each state forthe period 1928-1969, with nearly identical results (127-128).3. Alcohol AbuseThe findings on alcohol abuse are consistent with the hypothesisof increased mental disorder precipitated by social-psychologicalstress during economic recession. It was initially observed that in-creases in mortality rates due to cirrhosis of the liver were posi-tively related, over time, to consumption of alcohol (129). It wassubsequently estimated that there is a lag between the increase inper capita alcohol consumption and cirrhosis mortality rates (129).In addition, it was shown that consumption of distilled spirits(rather than wine or beer) was the significant factor in cirrhosismortality, and that such consumption was related to cyclical de-clines in the national economy. Finally, it was observed that cirrho-sis mortality itself increased substantially 1 to 2 years after nation-al economic recessions (129). It was clear that, because it takes along period of time to acquire chronic cirrhosis of the liver, theshort-term economic trauma had not initiated the cirrhotic condi-tion, but that, once morbidity was present, economic recessiontended to hasten mortality. 28Additional findings continued to reflect the importance of the re-lationship between the increased consumption of distilled spiritsand the declining state of the national economy. Thus, admissionsto mental hospitals in New York State and in the United States asa whole, of persons diagnosed as having psychosis related to alco-holism or with any alcohol-related mental disorder, showed sub-stantial and stable increases during economic recessions for theperiod 1921-1968 (127, 129). Similarly, arrests for drunkenness inMassachusetts were found to increase with adverse changes in thenational economy during 1915-1968, with the arrests lagging 2years behind fluctuations in the economy (129). Finally, the arrestrates for driving while intoxicated in the United States as a whole,and the number of persons brought to trial and found guilty ofdriving while intoxicated in the city of Philadelphia, were found toincrease substantially during national economic recessions (129).4. Motor Vehicle AccidentsIn keeping with the findings on the relationship of economic re-cession to arrests for driving while intoxicated are more generalfindings on the relationship of economic recession to deaths result-ing from automobile accidents in the United States (130). Thesefindings hold across all ages, both sexes, and whites and non-whites, and may or may not be related to alcohol abuse. This rela-tionship may be due in part to the effects of stress on intellectualfunctioning, which may, in turn, result in errors in driving or han-dling other machinery. It has also been suggested that automobileaccidents represent a form of highly aggressive and violent behav-ior related to decreased impulse control under stressful conditions.The latter hypothesis is consistent with findings that homiciderates have been strongly influenced by economic recession, particu-larly for white males in the United States, and in Canada, Eng-land, Wales, and Scotland (132-143).5. Heart DiseaseIncreasingly, empirical research has been devoted to factors inthe incidence of, and mortality from, heart disease. The first stud-ies clearly demonstrated that fluctuations in heart disease mortali-ty rates for New York State were inversely related to the employ-ment rate in New York State for 1915-1967. They also showed thatmortality from diseases of coronary arteries was related to fluctua-tions in the unemployment rate for the United States as a wholeduring 1930-1960 (133). Both the relationships for New York Stateand the United States showed that the peak of increased mortalitylagged at least 2 to 3 years behind economic recessions.The work on heart disease was followed by extensive studies ofthe relationship between national economic indicators and cardio-vascular-renal diseases in general (134). The hypothesis was thatthese illnesses include significant psychophysiological factors in-volving hypertension, as well as serum cholesterol levels. The totalcategory of cardiovascular-renal diseases and major subcategories,including circulatory system diseases and chronic nephritis, was ex-amined. Because cardiovascular-renal diseases account for approxi-mately 60 percent of all mortality in many industrialized nations, 29the data were examined in 10-year age groups, by race and sex, forthe United States during 1914-1968. A consistent relationship wasfound between national economic fluctuations, measured by percapita income or employment rates, and cardiovascular-renal dis-ease mortality rates. For cardiovascular-renal diseases in general,the peak lag behind economic recessions ranged from 3 to 6 years,depending on age, and the peak lags for chronic nephritis rangedfrom 0 to 2 years. For cerebrovascular diseases, the lag rangedfrom as much as 6 to 9 years.6. Infant MortalityThe infant mortality rate has long been regarded as one of themost sensitive indicators of the general socioeconomic level of thenation, and the relationship between the economy and infant, fetal,and maternal mortality has received extensive examination. In allindustrialized countries for which data are available, the seculartrend of industrial growth has been inversely related to the long-term trend in infant mortality rates (135). For industrialized soci-eties, however, the problem of adapting to economic change is asso-ciated less with the level of economic growth than with whetherthat growth is relatively smooth or chaotic.In investigating the relationship between economic instabilityand mortality in infants under 1 year of age, the following hypoth-eses were raised: (1) There is a short- to intermediate-range rela-tionship of approximately 0 to 3 years between economic trends orfluctuations and trends in infant mortality rates. This relationshiphas historically been an important component of the relationshipbetween low socioeconomic status and increased infant mortality.(2) This 0- to 3-year relationship has had more influence on infantmortality trends since 1950, perhaps as a result of the relative de-cline in the beneficial impact of secular economic growth in aneconomy that is already highly developed. To test the applicabilityof the hypotheses to the full age range of infant and fetal mortali-ty, the following categories were examined: rates of infant mortali-ty under 1 day, under 28 days, from 28 days through 1 year, andfetal mortality. All data were examined by race. All categories offetal and infant mortality increased sharply in relation to economicrecession with a peak lag of from 0 to 2 years (135).CRIMINAL JUSTICE INDICESThe trend in unemployment appears to be the most intensivelystudied economic factor in relation to crime. Thus, property crime(136) and delinquency (137, 138), as indicated by reported crimes onthe national level, are significantly related to unemployment. Ad-missions to prisons and the homicide rate also vary with unemploy-ment, according to several studies. For the period 1926-1962, ad-missions to state prisons and the homicide rate for the entireUnited States and for New York State were positively correlatedwith the unemployment rate (139). In the state of Georgia, theprison population was similarly observed to change with fluctua-tions in the unemployment rate during 1967-1974 (140). The size ofthe federal prison population was shown to be related to the unem-ployment index of 15 months earlier for the period 1952-1974 (141). 30Again, for the period 1960-1972, strong relationships were foundbetween the unemployment rate and both federal and state impris-onment for the United States as a whole (142).A cross-national comparison of California, Massachusetts, andNew York, and Canada, England, Wales, and Scotland, over theyears 1920-1940 and 1947-1973, also demonstrated positive rela-tionships between the unemployment rate and every measure ofcriminal activity, for both personal and property crimes (148). Fi-nally, several studies have indicated that unemployment directlyinfluences parole, mandatory release violations, and recidivism(144-146).UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AS INDICATORAlthough the health effects of high unemployment rates are notconfined to the unemployed population, considerable research hasfocused on the particular risks to the unemployed. For example, alarge national sample of middle-aged men in Britain shows thatbeing unemployed is associated with chronic physical illness, in-cluding bronchitis, obstructive lung disease, and ischemic heart dis-ease (169). One of the many published and unpublished reviews ofthe literature prepared in the last few years offers a particularlycogent assessment indicating that "there is good evidence thatlosing one's job can increase health risks, exacerbate chronic andlatent disorders, alter the usual patterns of health-seeking behaviorand exact numerous other social and interpersonal costs" (170, p.1116). Another study concludes ". ..it is clear that unemploymentin general is associated with individual psychological distress' (171,p. 11).SUMMARYThe recent investigation of the relationships between economicrecession and morbidity and mortality was preceded by a history ofresearch covering the relationships, at single points in time, of lowsocioeconomic status to high rates of morbidity, mortality, and lim-ited use of medical care. These relationships were consistentlyfound in epidemiological studies and health care utilization studies,and for both physical and mental disorders. Attempts were recent-ly made to measure the association between national economic re-cession and national health status.The hypothesized relationship was in fact found between adverseeconomic changes and declining health status. Specifically, rates ofsuicide; cirrhosis mortality; homicide; motor vehicle accident mor-tality; infant, fetal, and maternal mortality; mental hospitalization;and indicators of alcohol abuse all increased as national economicconditions deteriorated, with lags of less than 2 years. Similar rela-tionships between adverse economic conditions and health statuswere found for the cardiovascular-renal diseases, except that mor-tality from these diseases lagged for a period of from less than 2years to 9 years.The increase in morbidity in the population following economicrecession may be seriously compounded by a decline in use ofhealth services due to decreased purchasing power. This is an ex-tremely serious potential problem for maternal and child health 31and for illnesses in which rapid diagnosis and treatment are essen-tial. It should also be noted that the effects of economic recessionon health status vary greatly for different groups within the popu-lation. For individuals of comparatively low socioeconomic status,including a significant proportion of the nonwhite population, theconsequences may be particularly severe.Finally, a number of studies since the 1960s have found strongrelationships between crime indices and lack of employment. Rateof property crimes known to the police, admissions to state prisonson the state and national levels, and admissions to federal prisonshave been correlated with changes in the unemployment rate. Forrates of homicide and other personal crimes, significant positive re-lationships were found with changes in unemployment rates.RESEARCH CONCERNSIn relating trends in economic indicators to health status in in-dustrialized countries, one must distinguish between cyclicalchanges in the economies of non-socialist countries, where the pro-duction and consumption patterns are not planned, and the long-term effects of economic change. The long-term effects influencethe overall population life span and prevalence of chronic, versusacute infectious, diseases. The cyclical effects, on the other hand, in-fluence short- and medium-term departures from those long-termmortality and morbidity patterns.Lags must also be identified in analyzing the effects of economicchange on morbidity and mortality. In industrialized countries, atime generally passes between the change in the national economicindicator and the change of health status. For example, in the caseof chronic disease morbidity, one might expect the severe manifes-tations of illness to occur after a lengthy series of disturbances.An additional factor involves the issue of lags and the precisemechanisms whereby adverse changes in the economy may in-crease the population morbidity level. In the case of heart, cerebro-vascular, and renal diseases, it is assumed that the primary sourceof deleterious influence of economic adversity will be through themechanisms of social-psychological stress acting to elevate levels ofhypertension and, perhaps, blood cholesterol levels. One wouldassume that the effects of stress on hypertension or serum choles-terol would be prolonged and extensive (possibly 2 to 7 years) toproduce results of severe morbidity or mortality.The limitations of available data, gaps in our theoretical knowl-edge, and problems inherent in the methods of correlation have re-stricted causal interpretation of the findings discussed above. Con-sequently, there has been no consensus among specialists as to thecausal linkages in a number of the cases reviewed in this chapter.Nevertheless, the hypotheses on which the present report is basedare consistent with the basic findings contained in the literaturereviewed.REFERENCES1.

THE ECONOMIC CHANGE MODEL OF PATHOLOGYINTRODUCTIONA general theoretical model, the Economic Change Model of Pa-thology, was designed to model statistically the impact of changesin the economy on physical and mental health and criminal aggres-sion in the United States during the past 30 years. The modelbrings together a variety of economic conditions, organizes them incontext, and shows the relationships among them. Both the majoreconomic stresses of recession and the beneficial and deleteriousfactors related to economic growth and development are empha-sized. Thus, it is a model which can be used in times of both eco-nomic growth and decline so that different periods can be com-pared statistically and, over time, can be better understood.SCOPE OF THE STUDYAs outlined in detail in the previous chapter, both historical andrecent evidence demonstrate that low socioeconomic status is asso-ciated with poor health (1-7). Furthermore, it is argued that eco-nomic loss and downward mobility typically associated with reces-sion are related to increased morbidity and mortality, particularlyfor persons of low socioeconomic status.The Economic Change Model of Pathology is designed to contrib-ute to a more accurate picture of the complex relationship betweenthe economic environment and individual well-being by taking intoaccount the impact of changes in the economy on the social areasof physical and mental health and criminal aggression. Changes inmeasures of the aggregate economic status of the population areseen in relation to changes in the pathological indices. The processinvolves two steps. The first is to associate indicators of health andsocial pathology with each of the following model elements: eco-nomic growth, economic instability, economic inequality, adapta-tional errors associated with economic growth, and random shocks.The second is to generate and test hypotheses which emerge fromthe resulting relationships.Indices of social pathology and mortality are measures of humanhappiness and well-being. Mortality rates are indications of thechanging life span. Mental health indices-mental hospital admis-sion rates, suicide rates, and cirrhosis mortality rates-cover anumber of broad mental health problems which, taken together,generally reflect the overall mental health status of the population.Indices of criminal aggression-imprisonment, arrest, and majorcrimes-are measures of disturbance in the social environment.A distinction between long-term trend and cyclical change is cru-cial to an understanding of this model. Long-term trend refers tothe lengthy, relatively even process of growth which is healthy for(38) 39the economy. Cyclical change is the semi-periodic fluctuation ofmany aspects of national economic activity (employment, invest-ment, consumption patterns, etc.).The cyclical movement is one of two aspects of economic instabil-ity. The other is the problem of obsolescence, which results fromincreased productivity. Actual increased productivity occursthrough the process of invention and replacement: tractors replacehorses, and automated equipment replaces factory workers. Thisprocess may push some portion of the population out of the produc-tion process. In this way, short-term cyclical changes frequentlyinteract with long-term or structural economic changes.In periods of economic growth, the long-term decline in averageweekly hours worked in manufacturing and other industries is areasonably good indicator of increased leisure time and favorableworking conditions. In contrast, the short-term decline in averageweekly hours worked is associated with recession and is an indica-tor of economic loss for individuals, business organizations, and thepopulation as a whole.Lag StructureIt is also necessary in the general model to specify the range,over time, during which the relationships are expected to takeplace. In general, we expect increases in mortality rates, mentalpathology indices, and criminal justice indices to be seen within a6-year period during and after recession. Based on previous re-search in the United States and other countries (Canada, UnitedKingdom, France, West Germany, Sweden, Finland, Italy, Spain,and Australia), we expect that there will characteristically be twopeaks in the relationships within that 6-year lag period. The firstof these peaks, occurring during the first year of the recession, usu-ally reflects: (1) sharp psychological reactions to substantial eco-nomic loss such as is manifest in the suicide rate, in mortality af-fecting highly vulnerable populations, and in criminal justice indi-ces; (2) decline in nutrition and medical care utilization, which af-fects infant mortality and mortality among the chronically ill.The second peak typically occurs 2 to 3 years after recession, asmeasured at the highest level of the unemployment or businessfailure rates. Though chronic disease mortality (especially cardio-vascular disease) is particularly involved, nearly all sources of illhealth and social pathology are implicated. The 2- to 3-year peakreflects a period of continued economic loss for the population thatis downwardly mobile as a result of recession. This sequence can beobserved by examining standard chronologies of economic indica-tors.Recessions usually occur over a period of less than 12 monthswhich covers the time from the peak to the trough of economic ac-tivity. Specific "lagging" economic indicators, however, such as theunemployment rate, will usually not return to their pre-recessionlevel for 2 to 3 years. Following severe recessions, 4 to 5 years maypass before employment-related indices return to pre-recessionlevels. During the entire period of recession and subsequent de-pressed employment, the downwardly mobile population experi- 40ences continuous erosion of economic and social status with attend-ant damage to social relationships.It is noteworthy that much of the post-recession period of de-pressed employment occurs at a time when the majority of the pop-ulation is experiencing sustained economic improvement. This post-recession period, then, represents the time of maximal psychologi-cal deprivation for those who are seriously damaged by recession.At this time, the downwardly mobile population loses both in abso-lute terms and in relative terms as compared to the majority of thepopulation. The psychological trauma of the downwardly mobile atthis time is exacerbated by their own, their families', and their as-sociates' belief that their losses are probably permanent.The zero- to 5-year interval of increased mortality associatedwith recession is understood to reflect, in part, increases in the in-cidence or severity of chronic illnesses which in some instancesresult in mortality. It is assumed, however, that the majority ofthose whose ill health is aggravated by recession probably do notdie within a 6-year period of recession. Rather, the seriously ill pop-ulation becomes more vulnerable to mortality during at least thesubsequent decade. Their heightened vulnerability results fromthree mechanisms.The first is simply an acceleration of the natural progression ofchronic disease processes that have been stimulated or exacerbatedby recession. A second arises from the fact that subsequent reces-sions will occur and inflict more serious health consequences onthe population whose health has already been put at risk. Conse-quently, the extent of recession-related damage on a population'shealth is in part related to the degree of damage that was associat-ed with previous recessions. A third source of heightened vulner-ability reflects the increased probability of economic loss followingincreased severity of recession-related illness. A chronic mental orphysical disorder that becomes incapacitating will in turn increasethe difficulty of maintaining or regaining a job or income. This sec-ondary condition of deterioration in the subject's socioeconomic po-sition is then likely to increase the long-term risk of chronic dis-ease or mortality.To recapitulate, the general model specifies damage to mental,physical, and social well-being over a 16-year period. This period in-cludes the initial 6-year period of recession and its aftermath. Italso includes the damage to general physical health that may con-tinue over at least the subsequent decade.THE ECONOMIC CHANGE MODELEconomic GrowthThe first element of the Economic Change Model of Pathology,long-term economic growth, is taken to be the underpinning ofsocial well-being and increases in the life span. Long-term econom-ic growth is responsible for increased resources, or wealth percapita, by which society is better able to manage the natural andhuman environments. The relationship between growth and mor-tality derives from the basic definition that economic growth pro-duces higher levels of resources within a population. Resources can 41be allocated to: (1) improvements in the standard of living; (2) in-vestments in the development of new knowledge; and (3) invest-ments in the applications of existing knowledge (35, Ch. 9), includ-ing medical care and education of the population. Economic growthis also the basis for improved working conditions, including healthand safety measures, leisure and social insurance, and aid to thedisabled, elderly and poor.Over the long run, the net effects are the result of both benefi-cial and adverse factors made possible by growth. Beneficial factorsinclude the potential of social investment in the development ofnew knowledge. The application of that knowledge may result in ahigher standard of living: good nutrition; climate control throughhousing, clothing, and the use of fuel; parasite control; education;comfortable working conditions; and adequate monetary and socialremuneration for work. A major beneficial factor in the case ofmorbidity and mortality is the provision and utilization of primaryhealth services.Because the beneficial factors resulting from economic growthare generally greater in number and importance than the adversefactors, over the long run, the net effect of economic growth is ben-eficial to health. Economic growth provides the material resourcesnecessary for human adaptation to the environment. On occasion,however, technological innovations and social changes partly relat-ed to economic development result in adverse implications forhealth. These adverse results are usually due to lack of knowledgethat the technological or social changes are actually causing harmto health.Such lack of knowledge is generally related to the scientific prob-lems of measuring: (1) delayed effects (especially where they are cu-mulative, or distributed through time); (2) threshold effects (effectsthat do not produce health damage except at a certain level, orthreshold); and (3) interactive effects in which specified factors aredamaging only, or especially, in combination. Under conditions ofcontinued economic growth-particularly where these problems areof considerable societal concern-investments will be made into re-search that will ultimately provide an understanding of these prob-lems and technologies to minimize their harmful effects.A number of risk factors to physical and mental health, madepossible by high mass consumption and technological developmentrelated to long-term economic growth, have become unusuallyprominent during the past two decades. Included are the immoder-ate consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and animal fats;increased reliance on non-human energy sources and the corre-sponding effects of a sedentary life, such as a decline in cardiovas-cular fitness and consumption of excess calories; and the improperuse of medicine and psychotropic drugs.Economic growth is also related to a decline in strength and sta-bility of primary relationships, especially within the nuclear familyand extended kinship networks, as indicated by high and increas-ing divorce rates; high proportions of the population living alone;the prevalence of female-headed households; and career-related dis-ruptions to family formation and childbearing. 42This general theoretical conception of the effects of economicgrowth on health and social well-being leads to the following specif-ic hypothesis:The overall mortality rate for all ages of both sexes de-creases in relation to long-term increases in real per capitaincome.Long-term economic growth is defined, in this study, according toa measure of real per capita disposable income (i.e., accounting forthe rate of inflation). The "pure" trend element of economicgrowth tends to have an exponential form. We therefore fit an ex-ponential trend to the real per capita income and eliminate the cy-clical component, which is measured by the variables discussed inthe section on economic instability. The relationship between in-crease in economic growth and decrease in the overall and specificmortality rates is expected to hold under statistical controls fortrends in detrimental factors historically associated with economicgrowth, such as cigarette smoking, heavy consumption of alcoholicbeverages and animal fats, and measures of social isolation.Economic InstabilityEconomic instability as used in this report largely represents thedecline phase of the business cycle, indicated by a rising unemploy-ment rate, high rates of business failures, and declines in laborforce participation. As a result of economic instability, the popula-tion fails to gain benefits it would have gained if growth had con-tinued at a previous rate. The loss, or failure to gain, in benefits isnot evenly distributed. Persons with few or obsolete skills, workersin declining industries, older workers, and persons living in eco-nomically declining areas may be more adversely affected.Under these conditions, certain groups in the population experi-ence loss of, or serious damage to, their socioeconomic position.With persons who are downwardly mobile, the greatest psychologi-cal hardships occur when hope of re-establishing their former posi-tions is lost. Among the mechanisms involved which lead to psycho-logical harm are fear of loss of social identity; loss of basic econom-ic resources; loss of primary social relationships; forced migration;and fear of their inability-and intense striving-to re-establish so-cioeconomic position.It is also argued that recession will adversely affect those whowork. A secondary set of mechanisms affects employees whoremain at work. These include a lack of promotion and poor orcompetitive relations among staff; emphasis on high productivity;and work overload caused by critical shortages of employees and anatmosphere of anxiety and tension. Such conditions may generatefor much of the population stresses nearly equivalent to those re-sulting from loss of employment.We can derive the following general hypothesis from these theo-retical conceptions on the effects of economic instability on societalpathology:Economic instability relates to a higher incidence of physicaland mental ill health and criminal aggression. 43From this general hypothesis, we can derive the following specif-ic hypotheses:Increased unemployment rates are related to increases intotal mortality rates.Increased unemployment rates are related to increases incardiovascular mortality rates.Increased unemployment rates are related to increases incirrhosis mortality rates.Increased unemployment rates are related to increases insuicide rates.Increased unemployment rates are related to increases inmental hospital admission rates.Increased unemployment rates are related to increases inimprisonment rates.Increased unemployment rates are related to increases inthe rate of crimes (known to police by type).Increased unemployment rates are related to increases inthe homicide rates.The unemployment rate is the principal indicator of recession-re-lated economic loss used in this model. At the macro, or popula-tion, level of analysis, an increase in the unemployment rate is anindicator of the extent of recession and/or structural economic de-cline. Economic distress reflects, for some part of the population,loss of work; loss of income; downward social mobility; increasedstress; and possible increases in poverty levels. At this level ofanalysis, we can identify relationships between the aggregate un-employment rate-acting as an indicator of several sources ofsocial distress-and measures of health and criminal aggression.Other related hypotheses are as follows:The increased rate of business failure is related to increasesin total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and suicide rates.The business failure rate is a prominent indicator of recessionand is argued to be important for self-employed and small businessowners in the age group over 45, and especially over 65. This indi-cator tends to reflect a period of chronic anxiety, during whichbusiness persons struggle to save their firms from financial de-struction and protect themselves from major changes in socialstatus and way of life. We therefore anticipate a lag of within ap-proximately 2-3 years between an increased business failure rateand increased pathology rates.Decreases in labor force participation rates are related to in-creases in mortality rates, mental hospitalization admissionrates, and criminal justice indices.The unemployment rate and age- and sex-specific rates indicatemany of the effects of recession-related losses and anxieties, butthey actually measure only the extent to which members of thepopulation are looking for work. Substantial proportions of thosewho look for work, however, do not find it, become discouraged,and leave the labor force entirely. This has been true especially ofmales over the age of 45 during the past two decades. Because most 44of these persons are unemployed for 1 or 2 years before they leavethe labor force, we expect decreases in labor force participation tolead to increased pathology within 2 years.Increases in labor force participation of the 16- to 17-year-oldmale population are related to increases in the arrest rate ofpersons under 18, the crime rate, and the homicide rate.It is thought that increased labor force participation by 16-to 17-year-olds is a probable indication of alienation from sec-ondary school as well as of decreased family income. The formsof pathology most likely to demonstrate alienation and povertyin the 16- to 17-year-old male population are property crimesand violent crimes.Short-term decreases in average weekly hours worked are re-lated to increases in total and chronic disease mortality rates.Although not necessarily thought to result in profound psycho-logical or criminal deviance, the stress that results from lost hoursof work (and related lost income) during recession could triggerphysiological reactions in susceptible individuals.Economic InequalityEconomic inequality relates to the distribution of the product ofeconomic development. For reasons which usually depend on struc-tural changes in the economy, specific populations may not gain-or may actually experience losses in-economic status, while themajority of the population takes part in the process of economicgrowth. In the United States, youth, the elderly, women, andethnic minorities frequently experience this situation.Serious economic inequality has an even greater adverse impact,which is compounded during periods of economic growth, when themajority of society is earning at least moderate incomes and is notexperiencing high unemployment. The most adverse effects aretypically experienced by a significant proportion of youth of lowersocioeconomic status, especially those with minority ethnic back-grounds. Many elderly persons who are chronically impoverishedand a sizable proportion of female heads of households also experi-ence the worst effects of economic inequality. Finally, the problemsof long-term unemployment (as opposed to short-term cyclical un-employment) and low income have, in the last decade, been ex-tended to former workers in the automobile, glass, steel andrubber, and other durable goods industries which have sufferedlong-term declines in employment.In periods of economic instability, the economic loss and down-ward mobility typically associated with recession lead to expansionof socioeconomic status differentials; thus, the effects of recessionbecome an even greater burden, proportionally, on the downwardlymobile. Economic inequality becomes even more acute when thegeneral population is moving out of a recession. While some indi-viduals gain, a portion of the population never recovers. This por-tion then experiences lower socioeconomic status and exhibitshigher mortality rates. 45The model allows for the impact of economic inequality on thetwo preceding relationships by developing hypotheses for specificpopulations.Increases in the unemployment ratio for all ages and bothsexes are related to pathological indices.The reason is that none of the age- or sex-specific unemploymentrates corresponds exactly to the fluctuations of the overall unem-ployment rate. Using the ratio of age- and sex-specific unemploy-ment rates to the total unemployment rate, we can more preciselyidentify the relationship of each group's unemployment rate to itsown pathological pattern.Just as the total unemployment rate does not measure preciselythe unemployment situation of specific age and sex groups, neitherdoes the total per capita (real) income precisely measure the realincome gain or loss situation of each of the age and sex groups. Theproposed solution is the same; namely, in addition to the total percapita income, the age and sex median income ratios are used.Adaptational ErrorAdaptational error associated with economic growth refers to thepathological results of specific patterns of consumption and produc-tion. Pathologies occur either because of ignorance, difficulty inchanging habitual behavior, or potential damage to economic inter-ests, which are linked to the consumption or production of specificitems. Examples are immoderate alcohol consumption; abuse ofprescription or illicit drugs; cigarette smoking; regular consump-tion of foods that are excessively high in fat content; environmen-tal contamination with chemical toxins; greatly increased numbersof motor vehicles in the population; and failure. to use protectivedevices, such as seat belts, crash helmets, and air bags, in roadtraffic. Another adaptational problem associated with economicgrowth pertains to disturbed social relations such as social isolationdue to divorce or solitary living arrangements.Two sets of hypotheses emerge: one that addresses those adapta-tional errors which result from increased mass consumption and asecond that explains the social isolation that is associated with eco-nomic development.The hypotheses involving risks resulting from high mass con-sumption are as follows:An increase in the heavy consumption of alcoholic beverageis related to high mortality rates, especially from cardiovascu-lar illness and cirrhosis of the liver.Although moderate levels of drinking may be protective with re-spect to some illnesses (especially ischemic heart disease), heavyconsumption of alcoholic beverages is expected to show a positiverelation to general mortality, especially from cardiovascular ill-nesses and cirrhosis of the liver, specified malignancies, abortions,accidents, infant mortality, and alcohol dependence syndrome pos-sibly involving aggression or depression. In such cases, the lags arerelatively short (0-5 years), as this population may already bechronically morbid or affected by intervening changes in cognitive 46ability, mood, motor ability, or other factors that could influencetheir mortality rates.An increase of cigarette consumption per capita is related tohigher mortality rates, especially from cardiovascular and res-piratory diseases.The per capita consumption of cigarettes is expected to be posi-tively related to mortality rates, especially from cardiovascular andrespiratory disease. In this case, the lags may be short or long.Short lags of 6 months to 7 years occur in a population that is al-ready seriously ill and for which additional smoking exacerbatesserious disease. For other populations, the lag is generally 10 to 15years.A high level of consumption of animal fat is associated withhigh mortality rates, especially from cardiovascular diseaseand malignancy.A high level of consumption of animal fat is a risk factor in agreat many causes of illness-especially in cardiovascular diseaseand malignancies. The consumption of animal fats per capita is ex-pected to be related to total and ischemic heart disease mortality,with both short (less than 5 years) and long (15-20 years) lags. Theshort lag relationship is particularly pertinent to populations al-ready afflicted with cardiovascular disease.Increases in automobile registration rates and miles drivenper capita are related to higher mortality rates due to auto in-juries.Automobile registration rates and miles driven per capita are ex-pected to be positively related to mortality from injuries-especial-ly those involving youth-with a lag of less than 3 years.Hypotheses involving risk factors related to a decline in primaryrelationships follow:A high rate of divorce is related to a higher risk of mortalityand mental health problems.This is one of two prime indicators of potential lack of social in-tegration or social support. It is a standard finding in psychiatricepidemiology and recent studies of morbidity that the divorced pop-ulation is at considerably greater risk of illness and mortality.A high proportion of persons living alone is related to a highrisk of mortality and mental health problems.The number of persons living alone and an increase in the pro-portion of female heads of households indicate a potential lack ofsocial support. They are meant to reflect recent findings that socialcontact has a negative influence on morbidity. They uphold as welltenets of classic sociological literature on the alienating aspects ofadvanced urban living conditions.An increase in the proportion of female heads of householdsis related to an increase in the total mortality of persons underage 15. 47The proportion of female heads of households is also related topoverty, as households headed by females are disproportionatelyrepresented in the number of poor households. Poverty places chil-dren at higher risk of morbidity and mortality.Ameliorative effects of Aid to Families with Dependent Childrenare tested by the following hypothesis:Increases in the number of poor households receiving AFDCare related to decreases in the mortality of the young.Random ShocksAn additional set of factors, "random shocks" to the population,needs to be taken into account in order to use this economicchange model for detailed explanation or prediction. Randomshocks include: (1) extremely disruptive phenomena, such as severeclimatic irregularities; (2) epidemics; (3) events which damage theeconomy and the population in ways that go beyond usual econom-ic predictions, such as natural disasters or political or internationaleconomic crises; and (4) important demographic changes such aswere brought about by the "baby boom."The following hypothesis, for example, is suggested by demo-graphic developments:An increased proportion of males aged 15 to 24 in the popu-lation is associated with an increase in criminal activity.This hypothesis was tested in the 1976 report and showed statis-tical significance. In the current study, however, the potential rela-tionship between the ratio of young adult males in the populationand the criminal justice indices did not show evidence of an activerelationship. It is possible that a more appropriate variable may bethe youth unemployment ratio. The large numbers of males aged15 to 24 may have influenced the relatively high youth unemploy-ment rate, which may in turn influence criminal aggression.Involvement in war is a random shock adversely affecting thepopulation's health and life span, particularly of those actually en-gaged in military actions. Size of the military population is corre-lated with the number of people on active duty for combat. One hy-pothesis is:As the rate of military personnel in the population goes up,indices of pathology and mortality rates increase, especially forthe military-age population.LIMITATIONS OF THE MODELIn examining the specific cause of a relationship it is necessaryto be aware of the possibility that an unobserved external factor isresponsible for changes in both the predictor and predicted factors.In that case, the observed correlation between "explaining" and"explained" factors does not reflect a causal relation between themand instead results from their joint relation to a third factor.In the present study, there is no external unspecified factorwhich is known to influence regularly both the state of the econo-my and, independently, mortality or morbidity rates. On occasion, 48unusual conditions such as war may influence economic conditionsand health, but they do not do so on a continuous basis. There is noknown external factor which regularly influences the state of theeconomy. Indeed, if such a factor were known, we would be able touse it in efforts to forecast economic conditions.A different approach to the problem of the unknown externalfactor is to ask whether phenomena that are, for example, influ-enced by economic conditions also influence health. In this study,we ask that question with respect to several factors known to affecthealth adversely-alcohol, cigarette, and fat consumption percapita, social isolation, etc. The problem then is whether, if onecontrols for the effects of such additional factors, the relationshipsbetween economic conditions and health and social well-being stillcan be observed. In this study, such external factors are explicit inthe model to be tested, under the general classification "adapta-tional errors associated with economic growth." In fact, we findthat controlling for the adaptational error factors usually strength-ens rather than weakens the relationship between economic condi-tions and the population's health and well-being.We conclude, therefore, that the hypotheses do not appear to beinfluenced by issues of random occurrence or lack of control forfactors which should have been taken into account. As in all stud-ies based on statistical procedures, however, the findings can onlybe taken as evidence in favor of, or against, the specific hypothesestested.In this case, for example, considerable statistical support is foundfor the statement that economic instability is related to adversechange in national health and well-being. But it cannot be saidthat our findings prove the existence of causal relationships. Statis-tical studies only permit statements of probability, not absoluteproof.REFERENCES1.

RESULTSSUMMARYFor each of the five elements of the Economic Change Model ofPathology, the current study finds the following:Economic GrowthLong-term increases in real per capita income show statisticallysignificant relationships, almost without exception, to decreases inthe social pathologies investigated in this report. Although thestrength of the relationships varies by pathology and age group,economic growth is associated with decreases in total mortality,cardiovascular mortality, suicide, and psychiatric hospital andprison admissions.Economic InstabilityMeasures of economic instability show statistically significant re-lationships to increased mortality of all ages, and for all classifica-tions of sex and race. Similar relationships are found with meas-ures of mental ill health and criminal activity. The principal meas-ures of economic instability are unemployment, business failurerate, labor force participation, and average weekly hours of work.Economic InequalityMeasures of economic inequality, principally age-specific unem-ployment ratios, are associated with increases in the most deviantpathological behavior investigated in the report: criminal aggres-sion and pathological uses of alcohol.Adaptational ErrorThe measures of adaptational error associated with economicgrowth investigated in this report are unequivocally related topathological indices. Increased alcohol consumption relates toeither increases or decreases in the indices depending on the typeof beverage. Increases in all other adaptational errors are associat-ed with increases in all the health and social pathologies.These results are explained in detail in the following pages.INTERPRETATION OF RELATIONSHIPSThe hypotheses of the study indicate that trends and fluctuationsin national health levels are influenced by national economicchanges and are similarly influenced by national patterns of con-sumption, production, and social isolation.The relationships between national economic changes and na-tional health levels are based on simple and compound factors.(50) 51Simple factors are those that are measured by one variable, suchas alcohol consumption or animal fat consumption, and that can beinterpreted directly at the individual level. For example, the mean-ing of per capita cigarette consumption as a health risk for heartdisease is identical for both the individual and the population.In contrast, compound factors, such as economic instability, aremultidimensional and can be measured by several variables whichhave different implications for different individuals. For example,under conditions of economic instability or recession, unemploy-ment, substantial loss of income, departure from the labor force, in-creased work stress, home mortgage foreclosure, and forced migra-tion will increase. But an individual usually will not experience all,or even most, of them.To capture the harmful effect of recession as a health risk factor,we are able to use only a few variables to document economic loss.The measures of economic instability-rates of unemployment,labor force participation, and business failures-in fact representmore than they directly measure. Indirectly, as a group, they meas-ure a portion of the general population's recession-related experi-ence. The experience of individuals, however, may include econom-ic loss, the fear of further loss, and the attempt to regain socioeco-nomic position.Correlation and CausalityAnother point to bear in mind in interpreting these findings isthat the present study can only be used as evidence in favor of, oragainst, the hypotheses put forward. The findings cannot provideproof of causal relationships. It is commonly held that causal state-ments have three minimum requirements: first, that the causalvariable precede the affected variable in time; second, that there infact is a relationship between the variables (that is, the observedrelationship is not due to chance); and third, that some other vari-able does not cause both events in the model. The violation of anyof these criteria would prohibit the finding of causal relationship.This study attempted to account for each of these factors. Com-plete control, however, was impossible, and claims of direct causeand effect are therefore not made. For example, even though anelaborate time lag structure is specified, some relationships arefound with a zero time lag; that is, the relationship is measured asoccurring within 1 year. In these cases it is not known if the timeprecedence requirement is met. Also, even though the relationshipsare statistically significant, there is a small risk that they are dueto chance, which would violate the second requirement of causality.Finally, although there are no known events that influence bothnational economic change and national health, research in the fieldis not sufficiently advanced to preclude the possibility. This is espe-cially true at the individual level, where the complexity of the rela-tionships between individual's economic condition, stress, andmental and physical health are not fully understood.When a finding is observed to be statistically significant, we thenwish to know whether it is consistent with: (1) other findings in the*same study, (2) findings of related studies, and (3) theoretical con-siderations. Statistical significance, internal consistency, and con- 52sistency with the literature provide the evidence of the reliabilityand validity of the findings.The Implications of Linearity and NonlinearityThe findings reported in the present study assume, from a statis-tical standpoint, that the relationships between variables arelinear. This means that the model assumes that the change insocial pathologies is the same for all incremental changes in themeasures of economic change. This assumption of linearity is forthe ease of measurement only; in fact we have several reasons tobelieve that at least some of the relationships probably are not pre-cisely linear.It is possible that, for example, an increase in the unemploymentrate from 10 to 11 percent would cause greater social damage thanan increase from 2 to 3 percent. One assumption of linearity, how-ever, is consistent with the notion that it is typical for the leasteducated and least skilled workers to show the highest unemploy-ment rates at the point at which recession is judged to be mostsevere.On the other hand, the unemployed of lowest socioeconomicstatus may feel some alleviation of the sense of self-blame andsocial blame at being without work or income during the worstpart of the recession. Then, as recovery begins and unemploymentrates fall slightly, there is likely to be a period in which the unem-ployed of low socioeconomic status are the principal populationgroup that is unable to secure re-employment. Under such condi-tions, the psychological impact of recession on low socioeconomicgroups may be most severe. These possibilities, while in principlequite plausible, have yet to be investigated in thorough statisticaldetail.Equally important possibilities of non-linear relations exist inthe case of the non-economic factors influencing health and socialwell-being. Consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and animal fats andproduction of toxic chemicals are prominent examples. There maybe low thresholds, per capita, at which these substances are notharmful to the population s health. There may be thresholds abovewhich they are extraordinarily injurious and may actually increasethe risk to health exponentially. It is also possible that some ofthese substances may be more damaging when taken in combina-tion with one another.At present, our knowledge of such non-linear possibilities is inad-equate. For convenience of measurement, we maintain only thesimplest assumption, that of linearity. The caveat must be stated,nevertheless, that the structural features of our current model maybe less than precise in some instances.COMPARISON WITH THE 1976 FINDINGSThe basic finding of the 1976 report that long-term economicgrowth has a beneficial impact is reaffirmed. Also reaffirmed inthe current report is the extraordinary importance of recession andits relationship to societal pathology, which can be seen in virtual-ly all the indices of mental and physical illness and criminal jus-.tice activity. The present study reiterates the importance of the un- 53employment rate as the most reliable measure of recession-relatedinjury. The present study shows new evidence that business failurerates and declines in labor force participation play a substantialrole. The basic relationships between recession and the pathologi-cal measures are shown in this study, as in the previous one, totake place within a 6-year period. In the present study, however,we are also able to measure for the first time the pathological im-plications of recession which may occur for at least another decadebeyond the initial 6-year period of lag.The relationships between the adverse effects of recession andsocial well-being have changed as a result of specific measures ofeconomic inequality which were not examined in 1976. In the 1976report covering the years 1940-73, the primary measure of reces-sion, the unemployment rate, was shown to be the major short-term factor related to homicide, mental hospitalization, and cirrho-sis mortality. In the present study covering 1950-80, the economicinequality measures are at least of equal importance to the meas-ures of recession for these pathological indices.The importance of economic inequality is evident in each of thethree pathological measures. With respect to homicide, it is theyouth unemployment ratio that shows the dominant statistical re-lation, which may reflect the fact that homicide has increasinglybecome associated with young males. With respect to youth unem-ployment, the most serious problem has become one of economicstructure rather than recession. In the case of state and countymental hospitalization, the last two decades have shown greaterproportional admissions of the poor. The insured and middle-classpopulations have acquired greater access to psychiatric care in gen-eral hospitals, outpatient departments, and community mentalhealth centers. It is therefore likely to be the populations whosemental illnesses are serious and chronic and whose unemploymentsituations are semi-permanent, rather than strictly recession-relat-ed, that make up the great part of public mental hospital admis-sions.In the case of liver cirrhosis, increases in the ratio of age-specificincome to overall population income have become more importantin the short-term relationships to economic change, in comparisonwith the effects of overall national economic growth. Thus, alcoholmay have come into greater use in cases of economic stress thatare not confined to the poorest populations, but it is increasinglyimplicated in stress situations experienced by groups subject to rel-ative economic disadvantage.NEW FINDINGSThe most important statistically significant relationships foreach element of the Economic Change Model of Pathology are de-scribed below. As with all reported relationships, these findings arepresented without claim of demonstrated cause and effect.1. Economic GrowthThe overall mortality rate for all ages, both sexes, and the twomajor racial groups decreases in relation to long-term increases inreal per capita income. The relationship is also especially promi-29-726 0-84-5 54nent in the major categories of cardiovascular mortality and sui-cide. These conclusions conform to our general theoretical assump-tion that economic growth is the central feature of long-term im-provement in the life span at all ages.REAL PER CAPITA INCOMEThe long-term exponential trend in real per capita disposableincome is the most important indicator of long-term economicgrowth. As per capita income increases-at all ages, and for bothsexes and major racial groups (Table I)-mortality rates decrease.The same is true for cardiovascular disease mortality, at all agesand for both sexes, as well as for the two major disease subclassifi-cations of ischemic heart and cerebrovascular disease (Table I).With increased income, suicide by males-which usually is consid-erably more related to economic changes than suicide by females-decreases; this relationship is seen at all ages over 45. Admissionsto psychiatric hospitals and prisons also decrease in relation to agrowth trend in real per capita income.At the same time, annual decreases in real per capita income arerelated, after a 1-year lag, to a higher arrest rate for all crimes inthe age groups 18-24, 25-34, and over 55. This important relation-ship was specifically checked in relation to serious crime known tothe police, with separate analyses for burglary, larceny, auto theft,robbery, assault, and rape. Only rape did not show a decrease withan increase in per capita income. For the other crimes, the rela-tionship occurred only within 1 year. Finally, an increase in thearrest rate for crimes involving drug possession and sales were alsorelated to decreases in annual per capita income within 1 year(Table III).2. Economic InstabilityMeasures of economic instability are related to increased mortal-ity at all ages, and for all classifications of sex and race. When eco-nomic instability is measured by the unemployment rate, associat-ed increases in total mortality are usually seen over a 15-year in-terval, with the bulk of the increases occurring within 6 years(with particularly pronounced effects in the first 2 to 3 years).Other measures of economic instability-increased business failurerates and decreased labor force participation rates-are related tooverall mortality increases with lags of 2 years and less. Measuresof economic instability are related to indices of disturbed mentalhealth and illegal activity within 6 years, and are especially promi-nent within 3 years.These findings confirm our theory that the economic losses of re-cession, and other departures from smooth economic growth, areassociated with increased mortality, mental ill health, and criminalactivity.UNEMPLOYMENT RATEThe total unemployment rate shows the most consistent relation-ship to the pathological indices. For each one of the pathologies, astatistically significant relation to the unemployment rate is found. 55For total mortality at all ages (including infancy, 5-year age groupsfrom 1-4 through 65-74, and 75 and over), for both sexes, and fornonwhites, the basic relationship is evident (Tables I and II). Ingeneral, the lag between the unemployment rate and mortalityrates conforms to the specifications of the lag structure of the gen-eral model (see Lag Structure, pp. 39-40). For total mortality andmortality resulting from chronic diseases, two principal lags werespecified: (1) a lag within the first 0-5 years after an increase inthe unemployment rate, which comes to a peak at 2-3 years, and(2) a distributed lag over the following 6 to 15 years, which comesto an early or late peak depending on the cause of death. Two lagsare seen in the relationship of mortality to unemployment, one of2-3 years and another distributed over a range of 7-15 years, witha peak at approximately 10 years. These relationships prevailwhether total or age-specific unemployment rates are used in the 2-to 3-year lag relation and whether the data are analyzed from 1950to 1978 or to 1980.The cardiovascular mortality rate shows a similarly powerful re-lationship to the unemployment rate, typically with lags of 3 years(the peak year of short-term lag) and 10 years (the peak of the 7- to15-year lag span) for all 10-year age groups from 25 to 34 to 75 andover and for each sex. For both sexes, an additional lag of 5 yearsis seen in age groups from 25 to 54 (Table I). These relationshipswith the unemployment rate for total cardiovascular mortality alsofollow the basic pattern of lags found for total mortality as speci-fied by the general model. These findings for total cardiovascularmortality are further substantiated by findings of similar relation-ships for diagnostic subclassifications-ischemic heart disease (witha peak lag of 3 years) and cerebrovascular disease (with peak lagsof 3 and 10 years) (Table I).The case of cerebrovascular (or stroke) mortality is an excellentexample of confirming evidence for the general model as applied tochronic disease. Cerebrovascular mortality shows its first major re-lationship to unemployment (within a 0- to 5-year period) with apeak lag of 3 years; the peak period of stress following unemploy-ment usually occurs with a lag of 2-3 years (see Lag Structure, pp.39-40). The relationship between cerebrovascular mortality and theunemployment rate reaches a second peak after 10 years. The firstlag however, occurs within 0-5 years and identifies both: (1) in-creased fatalities among persons who had cerebrovascular disease,and (2) increased incidence of cardiovascular disease that has notresulted in mortality within 5 years. The second lag, which occurswithin 6-15 years, conforms to the assumption that a portion of theincreased incidence of cardiovascular disease which occurs within 5years of recession results in increased cerebrovascular mortalitywithin the next decade.For cirrhosis mortality, the unemployment relations are seen atpeak lags of 3-9 years, depending on age and sex (Table II). For sui-cide, the relationships of unemployment rates to mortality usuallyoccur with a 0- or 1-year lag for males at ages 15-74.Total admissions to all mental hospitals are related to the unem-ployment rate with a lag of 1 year. Admission of resident patientsto state hospitals, by specified age groups, is related to unemploy-ment with lags which correspond to the findings for overall mortal- 56ity and for suicide. The most prominent peak lags are approximate-ly 3-4 years, but lags are also found within 1 year, as in the case ofsuicide, and at approximately 6 years, as in the case of cardiovascu-lar disease mortality (Tables I, II, III).Homicide shows a relationship to the unemployment rate onlyfor selected age and sex groups-for example, females over 45 andelderly persons. Such patterns suggest family violence, includingchild abuse (both sexes aged 1-14), is implicated or robbery is in-volved. Other crime indices behave much as mortality does with re-spect to their relationships with the unemployment rate. Crimesknown to the police, including burglary, larceny, automobile theft(grand theft), robbery, assault, and rape, are related to the unem-ployment rate with a peak lag of 3 years. The same is true forarrest rates at virtually all ages and for the white collar crimes offraud and embezzlement.There is also a prominent relationship between unemploymentand arrest rates, including those for white collar crime, with a 0lag (especially ages 18-34). The relationship is similar for robberiesreported to the police (with a 3-year lag) and to homicide. For im-prisonment, the basic relationship to unemployment is also seenwith a 0 lag (Table III). It is possible that the absence of a relation-ship between unemployment and imprisonment after the first yearis due to: (1) lack of data classifying imprisonment by crime or age,or (2) disturbances, within the criminal justice system, in the rela-tionship between arrests and imprisonment, which we were unableto measure.BUSINESS FAILURE RATEThe rate of business bankruptcy is the economic indicator withthe second most prominent relationship to mortality rates. It wasexpected that this supplementary indicator of recession, and espe-cially of psychological stress, would be particularly important formales, and some females, at the peak of their careers. Even duringsevere recessions, unemployment is least likely to affect men (par-ticularly) in the 45-64 age groups, because they are likely to havejob seniority. Thus, only if firms terminate their operations is itlikely that, from the standpoint of the population aggregate, largenumbers of senior staff will undergo major financial loss or de-struction of career.Another group we expected to show substantial harm as a resultof business failure was the elderly whose incomes depend on invest-ments or who are owners, operators, or employees of small busi-nesses. (Small businesses have a particularly high failure rateduring recession.) Many of the elderly are retirees but continue toremain economically active, either for the income or for the fulfill-ment that work can provide.The independent relationship of business failures to total mortal-ity is difficult to measure because it frequently occurs with a peaklag of 2 years, in which case the unemployment rate is an equallysignificant factor. Nevertheless, it shows a significant relationship,with a zero lag, to male mortality rates at ages 50-64 and to mortalityfor both sexes combined at age 75 and over. The findings for busi-ness failures indicate a very strong relationship for a segment of 57the late middle-aged male and elderly populations, and are quiteclose to theoretical expectations. This relationship of business fail-ures to total mortality became increasingly powerful the closer theyear under study was to 1980, the latest year for which mortalitydata are available.It is with cardiovascular mortality that the relationship is espe-cially observable, probably because one of its two peak lags (2years) does not conflict with that of the unemployment relation-ship, which, for cardiovascular disease; has a lag of at least at 3years. For cardiovascular mortality, the first peak in the relation-ship with the business failure rate occurs with no lag for all malegroups ages 45-54 and over. In the case of suicide, the relationshipto business failures is significant in several age groups, and espe-cially for males, and thus influences the overall rate as well (TableII).In light of the hypotheses that recession has a long-term impacton mortality rates as discussed above (see Lag Structure, pp. 39-40),business failure rates were examined for the presence of relation-ships to total mortality with lags distributed within 6-15 years. Atall age groups over 45 years, the hypothesized distributed lag rela-tions were found. Moreover, the long lags in business failure rela-tionships are not simply substitute measures for identical long lagsin the case of the unemployment relationship to mortality, whichare found distributed over 7-15 years. Rather, the two principal in-dices of recession-unemployment and business failures-show in-dependent long-term relationships to mortality.LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATIONIn addition to the unemployment rate, as age-specific labor forceparticipation rates decline, total mortality rates frequently in-crease, with no lag. In such cases, the relationship is with mortali-ty at ages 55-64, 65-74, and 75 and over, as well as for infant mor-tality associated with male labor force participation at ages 20-24.The latter relationship, similar to that found for infant mortalityin connection with unemployment, is an indication of decline infamily socioeconomic status, with related declines in nutrition,medical care, and psychological stability. Substantial relationshipsbetween the rate of suicides for females and the age-specific femalelabor force participation rate are seen with lags of 0-3 years forages 35-44 through 65-74.In contrast to labor force participation for all other age groups,the participation rate for the 16- to 17-year-old population was ex-pected to show a positive relation to the pathology indices. It wasexpected that the substantial involvement of 16- to 17-year-olds inthe work force tended to indicate a comparative lack of involve-ment in or alienation from high school scholastic activity andgreater concern over economic competition with adults, againstwhom 16- to 17-year-olds have a comparative disadvantage. We ob-serve, indeed, that 16- to 17-year-old labor force participation ispositively associated with the arrest rate of persons under 18 (witha 1-year lag), with male and female homicide rates with zero lag,and with total mortality rates for both sexes aged 15-19. 58AVERAGE WEEKLY HOURS WORKED, MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIESBy comparison to unemployment and business failures, hoursworked is a somewhat less important indicator of the relationshipbetween health indices and recession in the United States. Thisbusiness cycle indicator tends to show stable inverse relationshipsto total mortality rates among groups aged 35-44 and 55-64, with a0 lag. Like business failures, it shows some relationship between in-creased mortality and recession with no lag, though the principalrelationships occur with longer lags.3. Economic InequalityThere are, of course, important elements of economic inequalityin the measures representing economic instability, because somegroups lose in periods of recession and economic disturbance, whilemost of the population does not. This situation has the effect of in-creasing the extent of inequality. The psychological sense of in-equality is further aggravated for the downwardly mobile duringthe subsequent period of sustained economic expansion.In the present study, however, we add specific measures of eco-nomic inequality identifying, for example, the differential rate ofunemployment in specific age groups compared to that of thegeneral population. Using such a specific measure of economic in-equality, we find that it shows a particularly strong relationship toincreased mental ill health, criminal aggression indices, and patho-logical uses of alcohol. These findings conform to theoretical expec-tations in that they represent the most deviant pathological behav-ior, as usually judged by society, and frequently reflect a deeplyalienated state of mind. The condition of being unemployed at atime when the population generally is not experiencing recession issimilarly likely to reflect a state of alienation.AGE-SPECIFIC UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCOME RATIOSThe unemployment ratio (the unemployment rate of a particularworker group divided by the total unemployment rate) for malesaged 15-24 is the most prominent of the unemployment ratios interms of relationship to the pathological indices. The outstandingrelationship is to the homicide rate. At nearly all ages for malehomicide, the 15-24 male unemployment ratio shows a peak rela-tionship with no lag; for female homicide, the typical peak relation-ship occurs with a 3-year lag. This may indicate that homicide ofwomen involves individuals whose alienation had developed overan extended period (over at least 3 years). The 15-24 male unem-ployment ratio is also related to the state imprisonment rate, withno lag (Table III).Age-specific unemployment ratios are especially prominent withrespect to rates of mental hospital utilization, at all ages fromunder 25 to over 65, with a 1-year lag. The unemployment ratioover 65 is particularly significant in its association with the totalpsychiatric hospital admission rate.The male non-white unemployment ratio is significantly relatedto the state prison admissions rate, with a peak lag of 2 years; it is 59also related to the mental hospital population size for ages 45-64and over 65, with a zero lag.The age-specific income ratio was found to be significantly relat-ed to the cirrhosis mortality rate, with a peak lag of 1 year formales aged 25-64 and over 75 and for females aged 35-74.4. Adaptational Error Associated With Economic GrowthThe relationships of these factors to our measures of pathologyalso conform to the expectations of the general model. Except foralcohol consumption, which shows both positive and negative rela-tionships, depending on the specific beverage and pathology, all ofthese factors unequivocally relate to increases in pathological indi-ces.ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION PER CAPITAAlcohol consumption, which serves as a control variable in thisstudy, typically shows an important relationship to virtually all thepathologies under study, with lags of 5 years of less. Total con-sumption, which emphasizes beer, tends to be statistically influen-tial in pathologies that involve young adult populations including:mental hospital patient populations,. arrest rates, crimes known tothe police, narcotic arrest rates, suicide of males in several agegroups, and suicide of females aged 15-24. It is very strongly associ-ated with homicide of males and females over almost the entire agespan and appears to account statistically, along with narcotics ar-rests, for much of the long-term pattern of homicide.Spirits consumption per capita is important in total mortalitypatterns for virtually all ages and both sexes, with a zero lag. Inthe case of cardiovascular disease mortality, spirits consumptionshows relationships for males aged 25-44 and for females aged 35-64 and over 75. It is also significant and positive for ischemic heartand cerebrovascular diseases (Table I). In the case of cirrhosis mor-tality, spirits consumption shows a stable relationship, with lags ofless than 3 years, for nearly all ages and both sexes. Attempts tomeasure longer lags in the spirits-cirrhosis relationship were un-successful. In fact, it is thought that this relationship is probablycumulative, i.e., that marginal short-term increases in alcohol con-sumption can be fatal for individuals who already have seriousliver damage due to heavy drinking for 10-20 years.In the suicide relationship, spirits consumption shows a 0 lag formales aged 35-54 and females 25-54. Spirits consumption is signifi-cantly related to mental hospital admissions, with a peak lag of 3years, which is possibly reflected in the similar 3-year lag in therelationship between spirits consumption and mental hospital pop-ulation size at over 45 years of age. Spirits consumption per capitais also positively related to hospitalization, with a 0 lag, for thepopulation under age 25. Spirits consumption is also associatedwith arrests, with 3-year or shorter lags, for the population over 35years.Wine consumption per capita is inversely related to cardiovascu-lar mortality of males of ages 25-44, and positively related to thatof both sexes over the age of 75. The predominantly inverse rela-tionship to cardiovascular disease is probably accounted for by is- 60chemic heart disease, in which the relationship with wine con-sumption is also inverse (Table I). On the other hand, wine con-sumption is strongly and positively related to cirrhosis mortality,usually with a peak lag of 3 years; for male age groups 35-74 andfor female groups 25-64 and over 75. Wine consumption is alsopositively related to the suicide rate of women at ages 35-44 and55-74.Beer consumption per capita is positively related to total infantmortality (no lag), probably reflecting immoderate use of alcoholduring pregnancy, and for persons aged 15-34 (with a lag of 2 yearsfor the combined sexes). At the same time, beer consumption is in-versely related to cardiovascular mortality for males at nearly allages. This probably reflects the strong relationship between an in-crease in beer consumption per capita and a decrease in ischemicheart disease mortality, with a peak lag of 5 years. This inverse re-lationship between beer consumption (and, to some extent, wineconsumption) and ischemic heart disease probably reflects themedically well-known observation that moderate alcohol consump-tion is, statistically, a beneficial factor in this illness. Finally, theratio of beer (which reflects the weakest form of alcohol as meas-ured by ethanol content) to total alcohol consumption is consistent-ly inversely related to cirrhosis mortality at 0 lag for nearly allages.CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION PER CAPITALike alcohol consumption, consumption- of cigarettes per capitahas a pervasive relationship to mortality rates, but, unlike alcohol,the relationship is always positive. At all age groups for males, andfor nearly all female age groups, the relationship between cigaretteconsumption and mortality occurs with lags of 4-8 years, with thelast lag coming to a peak at the 5-year mark. It is possible that thelags may be indirect among age groups which do not smoke-non-smokers may reside or work in an environment pervaded bysmoke, and/or such an environment may present other risks asso-ciated with respiratory illness. Alternatively, the lag betweensmoking and mortality may have an effect which increases mortali-ty or morbidity in parents or relatives of those whose risk of mor-tality has increased; in that case, the direct influence of cigaretteconsumption might be brought about by social isolation or declinein economic status due to illness or death. The importance of ciga-rette consumption to cardiovascular mortality is also seen in thesignificant relationships between cigarette consumption and ische-mic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease mortality, with 10-and 7-year peak lags, respectively (Table I).ANIMAL FAT CONSUMPTION PER CAPITAThe significant relationship between animal fat consumption percapita and ischemic heart disease mortality is found with a peaklag of 1 year (Table I). 61CHEMICAL PRODUCTIONBased on clinical studies, synthetic organic chemicals are knownto pose significant risk of liver disease. It is thought that liverdamage may be greater in individuals who use alcohol heavily andwho are exposed to toxic industrial or pharmaceutical chemicals.This has led to the hypothesis that chemical production may bepositively associated with cirrhosis mortality rates. The relation-ships were found, with a 1-year lag, for males at ages 35-74, andfor females at ages 45-64. The wider age span in the relationshipfor males is consistent with the hypothesis that males experiencegreater occupational-related exposure to chemical toxins.AUTOMOBILE OWNERSHIPAutomobile ownership per capita, which is greater in periods oflong-term economic growth, is a control variable expressing the po-tential for mortality due to automobile use. It shows a stable posi-tive relationship to mortality for both sexes in the age range 10-44.NARCOTICS ARREST RATEThe recreational use of street drugs is another adverse effect oflong-term economic growth. The narcotics arrest rate, of course,has importance in periods which are economically unstable as well.The rate of narcotics arrests is frequently used in this study to in-dicate the shape, over time, of illegal use of narcotics by the gener-al population. This narcotics use indicator is significantly related tothe homicide rate at nearly all ages, with lags ranging from 0 to 3years, but the peak lag is 1 year. The narcotics arrest rate alsoshows strong associations with mental hospital admissions with apeak lag of 1 year, admission of mental hospital resident patientsunder age 25 with lags of zero and 1 year, and total state prisonadmissions with a lag of 1 year (Table III).DIVORCE RATEThe divorce rate is found to have a positive relationship with vir-tually all of the pathological indices under study. In nearly all agegroups, there is a stable statistical link with no lag. This relation-ship affects fewer age groups in cardiovascular and cirrhosis mor-tality, except that it is nearly always present in the case of malecirrhosis with a 1-year lag. The relationship is found in the case ofsuicide for both sexes in young and middle-aged groups (where di-vorce is most frequent), with a typical peak lag of 2 years.The divorce rate is, unexpectedly, related to male homicide forall but two age groups, with peak lags of 0-3 years, while only onefemale age group (45-54 with a 1-year lag) shows the relation.Arrest rates are related to divorce rates for age groups under 18and 45-54, with no lag. The divorce rate is also seen as a statisticalcontributor to mental hospital admissions, with a zero lag, and toadmission of mental hospital resident patients, with peak lags of 1and 3 years, for age groups 25-44 and over 65, respectively. 62LIVING ALONE, PROPORTION OF POPULATIONThe proportion of the population living alone, like the divorcerate, is an important indication of social isolation and is positivelyrelated to the pathological indices. In the case of total mortality,the relationship, when found, is seen with no lag. The shortness ofthe lag strongly suggests that it is family and other social disinte-gration, occurring well before the decision to live alone or divorce,that is primarily responsible for the timing of these statistical rela-tionships. The relationship applies to nearly all age groups amongmales, while for females, after occurring at infancy, it does not re-appear until the mid-20s. For females, it is especially consistentafter age 55. Similarly, the relationship between living alone andcardiovascular mortality can be seen for nearly all ages, for bothsexes, with lags of 0-1 year. For suicide, the relationship is statisti-cally significant in five of the male and female age groups, withlags ranging from 0 to 3 years. The relationship between livingalone and homicide is not as definite as for suicide, only affectingthree male age groups and two female groups, with lags of 0-3years. The arrest rate, on the other hand, shows a relationship forages 18-44 and over 55, with lags of 0 and 1 year.FEMALE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLDSThe proportion of female heads of households is significantly re-lated to total mortality rates in males and females at ages 1-14.This indicator of low-income status had a consistent relationship tomortality with a 1-year lag.AID TO FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN (AFDC)The importance of the inverse relation of AFDC to total mortali-ty is demonstrated in the cases of infant mortality for both sexes,with a zero lag, as well as female mortality at ages 1-4 and 5-9,with peak lags of 2 and 3 years, respectively. As more money isavailable for nutrition and health care during childhood, includingthe first year of life, mortality declines. AFDC provides benefits forenhanced nutrition and medical care, but it also indicates the ab-sence of an adult male who would ordinarily provide some securityfrom physical harm to a mother and her children. The result is arelationship between AFDC and homicide of males aged 1-4 and 5-14 and of females aged 1-4, 5-14 and 14-24. AFDC is also related tostate prison admissions, with no lag, and suicide by males aged 15-24.5. Random ShocksMILITARY PERSONNELMilitary personnel on active service was used as a control in theanalysis of total mortality for males at ages 15-24 and 25-34. Thepositive relationship was found with lags of 0 and 1 year, respec-tively. Military service, like other major life changes, was hypoth-esized to have disorganizing effects, for some individuals, on careerpatterns, family formation, and family stability. Related health 63risks of military service could include accidents, violence, and im-moderate use of alcohol or drugs.PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION IN THE 15-24 AGE GROUPIn the United States since 1950, crime has been predominantlycommitted by males aged 15-24. It has been thought by specialiststhat the size of the younger population, in comparison to that ofthe overall population, is a factor in crime trends. This is arguedon the grounds that: (1) a higher youth-to-overall population ratiois responsible for higher youth unemployment rates and (2) a moreyouthful population is at greater risk of committing crime. Elabo-rating on the first point, a higher youth unemployment rate wouldbe an important factor in the overall unemployment rate andwould be especially important in the youth-population unemploy-ment ratio.The 1976 report stated that both the overall unemployment rateand the unemployment ratio of youth aged 15-24 were significantinfluences on homicide and imprisonment. In the present study, inwhich total unemployment and the 15-24 unemployment ratio areincluded, and where alcohol consumption, narcotics arrests, divorcerates, and the proportion of the population living alone are con-trolled, we are unable to find an independent significant relationfor the 15-24 population ratio for the various crime indices. There-fore, to the extent that the 15-24 population is indirectly a factorin the crime indices, it probably acts through its effects on unem-ployment rates or age-specific unemployment ratios, or perhaps onthe extent of alcohol or drug use, divorce, or the proportion of thepopulation living alone.6. The Issue of "Beneficial" Effects of RecessionAs in previous analyses, this study again shows a relationship ofrecessionary indices, such as unemployment and business failures,to increased pathology generally with a 2-3 year lag. Because ofthis pattern, it could be asked whether, with no lag, the relation ofunemployment to mortality may be inverse. This question reflectsthe possibility that a decrease in labor activity may lead to lowermortality within one year, as occupational risks associated withbeing at work are removed.This question can be answered in two ways. First, the only signif-icant occasions on which unemployment rates are inversely relatedto mortality rates involve simple bivariate relations-i.e., withoutcontrols for the relevant epidemiological risk factors. In otherwords, when, as in the present study, alcohol, cigarette and fat con-sumption, and social isolation factors are taken into account, thereis rarely an inverse relation between unemployment and chronicdisease mortality rates with a zero lag. (In the case of automobileaccident mortality, incidentally, necessary controls would includecar ownership and miles traveled per capita.)Second, we have tested more directly whether being at work rep-resents an increased mortality risk within one year by examiningaverage weekly hours worked in manufacturing industries and age-specific labor force participation rates. In both cases, with a lag ofzero (i.e., within a year), decreased average hours of work per week 64and labor force participation are related to increased mortality. Inaddition, it was reported above that increased business failurerates are related, for example, to increased cardiovascular mortali-ty rates with a lag of zero (as well as with a two year lag).It is therefore clear that decreased labor activity, with appropri-ate statistical controls, poses an increased risk to mortality withinone year. At the same time it should be emphasized that thesefindings are consistent with the research literature indicating long-term (i.e., 10-30 years) increases in mortality risk in specified occu-pations, especially involving malignancies and chronic respiratorydiseases. Further, as has been discussed, during recession the riskof work stress by those who remain employed is also likely to in-crease due to: (1) threat of loss of income, career, and social con-tacts, and (2) increased tension and demands for increased produc-tivity, and lower margins for error.7. Indirect Effects of Recession on Social Pathologies: ExperimentalResultsThe principal objective of this study is to estimate the effects ofchanges in economic conditions on measures of health and socialwell-being. To obtain such estimates, it was considered essential toexamine the relationships between economic indices (including percapita income, unemployment rates, and business failure rates) andpathology indices, holding constant, or controlling for, those factorswhich might otherwise influence the pathological indices. For ex-ample, heavy alcohol and cigarette consumption were consideredcontrol factors.At the same time, it was assumed that such factors as heavy useof alcohol and tobacco are greatly influenced by situations of ex-traordinary psychological stress-especially stress that might ariseout of economic disturbances. It was further assumed that, at thenational level, other factors, especially including increases in realper capita disposable income, would largely be responsible for thetrends and fluctuations in overall per capita consumption of thesesubstances.Our findings tend to confirm the assumption that such factors asalcohol and tobacco consumption per capita should be held con-stant. First, these control factors were found to coexist with unem-ployment and business failures as influences on the pathological in-dices. Second, in several instances, holding the control factors con-stant appeared to serve the important function of allowing the sig-nificant relationship to be measured.As the major statistical analyses for this project were being com-pleted, it became clear that recession-related factors might exert asubstantial influence on the control variables. The implication wasthat some of the effect of the control variables on the pathologicalindices was perhaps due in part to the indirect influence of the re-cession-related factors. Suspicion about indirect effects was arousedwhen it was found that, in mortality due to cirrhosis, suicide, andhomicide, the impact of the unemployment rate was substantiallylower than was calculated in the 1976 report, when no control fac-tors were used. In addition, for those causes of mortality, control 65factors such as alcohol consumption, proportion of the populationliving alone, and the divorce rate were frequently significant.Tests were then conducted to ascertain whether several of thecontrol factors were likely to be influenced by unemployment andbusiness failure rates. It was found that, other factors held con-stant, the unemployment rate was significantly related to increasesin cigarette consumption and the proportion of the populationliving alone. The business failure rate was significantly related toincrease in cigarette and spirits consumption, the divorce rate, anddecrease in beer and wine consumption. The implication is that thenegative influence of cigarette and spirits consumption on, for ex-ample, total mortality, and that of divorce and living alone on sui-cide, probably reflect in part the indirect effects of recession.Having obtained strong experimental evidence of the indirect ef-fects of recession on pathology, attempts were made to obtainrough estimates of the order of magnitude of these indirect effectson a sample of age-adjusted causes of pathology.It was estimated that the combined indirect effects of unemploy-ment and business failure rates on total mortality and cardiovascu-lar mortality were approximately 200 and 150 percent, respectively,of the direct effects attributed to the unemployment rate. These ex-amples of indirect effects were due entirely to the positive relation-ships between both unemployment and business failure rates andcigarette consumption.The combined indirect effects of unemployment and business fail-ure rates on suicide were approximately 11 times the direct effectsattributed to the unemployment rate. These indirect effects arelinked to the positive relationships between: (1) business failuresand spirits consumption and (2) unemployment rates and the pro-portion of the population living alone. Spirits consumption and pro-portion of the population living alone, in turn, are both related toincreases in the suicide rate.

VI. APPLICATIONS TO ECONOMIC POLICYThe government's need to ascertain the quantitative implicationsof its economic policies arises because economic policies, deliberateor not, influence the nation's health and social behavior, and be-cause the government has some responsibility for dealing with theproblems of physical and mental illness and aggression.Traditionally, economic policy has not been formulated on thebasis of its objective implications for national health and well-being. Yet, to the extent that economic policy influences nationaleconomic activity, it has also influenced the nation's social well-being. Although it is usually assumed that high levels of unemploy-ment, lack of economic growth, business failures, and economic in-equality are undesirable and have unfortunate implications, themagnitude of these implications has never been clear.This study, among others, has indicated the importance of eco--nomic growth for health and social well-being, the damaging effectsof recession and its attendant losses, and the importance of equityconsiderations. Hardly a national economic policy decision arisesthat may not affect health levels, since policies that stimulate orcurtail economic growth and employment intrinsically affect socio-economic status and opportunities for social mobility, and conse-quently, influence health.ESTIMATION OF SOCIAL COSTSSocial costs are assessed by aggregating the various types ofhuman reactions, such as mental hospital admission, use of pri-mary and secondary health care, or imprisonment. Monetary costs,on the other hand, are calculated on the basis of: (1) the cost ofusing institutional facilities (prisons, mental hospitals, hospitals,and other medical care or criminal justice system requirements); (2)the cost to the families of the individuals who are ill, have died, orwho have received injuries as a result of crime; and (3) the costs tothe economy as a whole of debilitated or injured members of thelabor force or of those who died of causes related to national eco-nomic distress.In Table IV we provide estimates of the relationship between theprincipal economic indicators and changes in social pathologymeasures as they would have applied at specific times in the past.In this procedure, the full equations containing coefficients of therelationships between the economic indices and the various patho-logical indices were used. The incidence of societal pathologies wascalculated for the 1980 population base.An aggregate incidence was obtained for each of the indices ofpathology based on the sum of the age-specific incidences. The age-specific sum was used rather than the incidence derived from asingle equation representing either the total crude pathology meas-(70) 71ure or an age-adjusted measure. This is based partly on the differ-ences in reaction patterns among age/sex subgroups to economictrauma and on the need to control for the effects of national eco-nomic changes on the population structure.Effects of economic policy that can be measured would ordinarilybe seen in levels of, or rates of change in, such indices as unem-ployment, per capita income, and business failures. One method ofassessing the impact of future economic policies on social welfarewould be a tentative forecast of the level of social pathology thatwould be related to a specific economic indicator. Such a forecastwould be based on the historical record of the statistical relation-ship between the economic and social indices.For example, in making a decision about the relative social costsof unemployment rates, one might project the values of mortalityrates for specific causes that would be associated with differentvalues for unemployment rates. Whether or not a 7 percent rate ofunemployment is considered "tolerable," for example, woulddepend among other considerations on the estimated associatedrate of morality.It should be emphasized that any inferences about the futureimpact of economic indicators on social indices are built on the as-sumption of continuity in historical relationships. Two types of re-lationships are in fact subsumed, one among several economic indi-ces, and the other between each of the economic indices and eachof the several social indices. The relationships themselves are basedon empirical research using data covering specific historical peri-ods. In making assumptions about the future of any of these rela-tionships, one must first assume that the structure and stability ofthe relationship will remain as they were during the period overwhich they were tested. When significant political and socialchanges interfere with the strength or stability of the basic rela-tionships, assumptions will be altered.Nevertheless, inferences about future situations are worthwhile.In the absence of more accurate indications of how economictrauma might inflict indirect social costs, they do provide an indi-cation of social costs and benefits of alternative policies.DERIVATION OF MONETARY COSTSa. Methodological Issues Related to Health CostsDIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTSThe human costs associated with illness and early mortality areincalculable. Even the economic costs cannot be calculated withprecision. Considerable progress has been made, however, in the de-velopment of methods for estimating the economic costs that occuras a result of illness or death. These represent expenditures onmedical care, including hospital costs and fees for physicians' serv-ices and for pharmaceuticals. The indirect costs include both mor-bidity and mortality costs; morbidity costs reflect loss of workingtime by the ill or disabled, and mortality costs involve loss of ex-pected earnings due to premature death (1-5).The indirect costs of illness and premature death are calculatedon the basis of average age- and sex-specific earnings, provided by 72the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as on wage supple-ments. Lifetime earnings, estimated on the basis of these cross-sec-tional data, take into account that earnings usually increase withage, and are adjusted to account for increases in productivity pro-jected to occur along with economic growth and for varying laborforce participation rates according to age and sex.There is no accurate way to measure forgone productivity due toillness among many women, because the value of household workmust be added to earnings. Because there is no market price forhousehold services, the currently used method estimates the cost ofreplacing household services with person-hours from the laborforce (6). This method, which is based on time-motion study ofhousewives and the assumption of labor market replacement ofanalogous activities, is far from precise. Yet this method is superiorto assessment by sample survey of the population's "willingness topay" for household services, since individual responses would be ex-tremely variable.DISCOUNT RATEIn order to have a base of comparison with present costs, futurecosts based on projected earnings must be reduced to their presentvalue, or be discounted. The theory is that costs in the present ornear future are more of a burden than those in the distant future.There is agreement among economists on the principle of discount-ing, but considerable controversy as to the appropriate discountrate to be used in general and in specific circumstances. Indeed,the literature on the discount rate, reflecting this controversy, isextensive and has been reviewed in several contexts (e.g., 7, 8).Calculations of the indirect costs of premature death or disabilitygenerally use discount rates ranging from 2 to 10 percent. In thepresent study, for total and cardiovascular illness (based on datafor total and cardiovascular mortality rates), we provide a range ofcost estimates based on discount rates of 2.5 percent and 10 per-cent, since the initial cost data have been worked out for these cat-egories (9, 10).INFLATION FACTORAnother issue in economic cost calculation concerns the value ofthe dollars projected over time. Typically, adjustment is made inthe estimates to account for increases in prices of goods and serv-ices. The three approaches taken include calculation of increasedcosts of medical or institutional care, wage rates, and overall pricesbased on the rate of inflation as measured by changes in the con-sumer price index (CPI).In this study, projected increases in medical care costs are usedto deflate direct costs of illness; projected increases in wage ratesare used to estimate the indirect costs of expected earnings for-gone. The CPI is not used for deflation in the illness or mortalitycosts, but is used to deflate dollar costs of property crime loss.Original data for 1975 on average wages, medical costs, and de-tailed elements of the CPI are based on the Social Security Admin-istration II B assumptions (12) and the Board of Trustees of theFederal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund Annual Report (13). These 73estimates have been adjusted for the increased CPI, average wages,and rise in medical costs for the years between 1975 and 1980 bydata from the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old Age and Survi-vors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds (14, 15).PREVALENCE APPROACHIn the economic cost calculation of forgone earnings, this studyhas adopted the prevalence method of estimation. In the preva-lence approach, the medical expenses of all cases prevalent duringa particular year are calculated, and indirect costs from futureearnings forgone due to mortality are assigned back to that year. Itwould also be important to know the lifetime costs associated withthe incidence of disease, or the cost per new case of disease fromonset until cure or mortality. This incidenced-based method of esti-mating lifetime costs is difficult to calculate.The difficulty lies in the need to take into account the likelycourse of a disease; the type, volume, and cost of medical care thatis usually used; the severity and duration of illness; and the effectof morbidity and mortality on earnings. Data and knowledge limi-tations preclude the use of the incidence method in this study. Inthe future, such incidence-based procedures as have been developedby Policy Analysis, Inc. (4, 5, 11) could be adopted. At present, weuse the available cost calculations provided in Health: UnitedStates, 1980 (9) and Costs of Disease and Illness in the UnitedStates in the Year 2000 (10).b. Cost of Total Illness and Diseases of the Circulatory SystemFor estimating the costs of total illness and diseases of the circu-latory system, we use two alternative estimates for indirect costs,based respectively on a 2.5 percent and a 10 percent discount rate.The 1975 figures are taken from Health United States, 1980 (9) andCosts of Disease and Illness in the United States in the Year 2000(10). Linking mortality in this study with total economic costs of re-cession assumes that the impact of recession on direct care andmorbidity costs is comparable to its impact on mortality.For each group, the Year 2000 and Health 1980 reports estimatedthree types of cost in arriving at the economic cost of illness for1975. These costs were inflated to 1980 levels as follows:-direct costs of prevention, detection, and treatment were in-creased to 1980 levels by using the same percentage increasethat occurred in estimated personal health care expendituresfrom 1972-1975 and by adjusting these figures for a 57.69 per-cent increase in medical care cost between 1975 and 1980.-indirect costs of disability (morbidity), the lost earnings andvalue of unperformed housekeeping services resulting from ill-ness, were increased to 1975 levels by the percentage increasein average wages over 1972-1975, and adjusted for a 49.3 per-cent increase in average wages to 1980.-indirect costs of premature death (mortality), the presentvalue of expected lifetime earnings or the market value ofhousekeeping services, were increased to 1980 levels by thepercentage increase in average wages over 1972-1975 and 74again adjusted for a 49.3 percent increase in average wages be-tween 1975 and 1980.The final step was to link the equation-based estimates of theimpact of economic instability on total mortality and on cardiovas-cular mortality with these estimates of the costs in 1980 of totalillness and of diseases of the circulatory system.Table A in Chapter II provides the proportion of total stress inci-dence attributed to various kinds of economic indicators; e.g., .023is the proportion of deaths from all causes related to a 14.3 percentincrease in the unemployment rate.Table B in Chapter II provides dollar costs associated with thechanges in stress following the author's 1976 methodology in "Esti-mates of Selected Economic Costs of Unemployment." For example,if the cost of illness is $366.6 billion in 1980, then the economic lossassociated with a 14.3 percent rise in the unemployment rate is$366.6x.023 (billion)=$8,479 million at a 10 percent discount ratefor obtaining indirect costs. The same estimate discounted at 2.5percent yields $11,371 million.COST OF TOTAL ILLNESS[In billions of dollars]Direct cost Indirect Total cost(i) Using 10 percent discount rate:1975 ............................................................ .1 1 8.5 120.4 238.91980 ............................................................. .186.9 179.8 366.6(ii) Using 2.5 percent discount rate:1975 ............................................................ .118.5 204.1 322.61980 ............................................................ .186.9 304.7 491.6COST OF DISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM[In billions of dollars]Direct cost Indirect Total cost(i) Using 10 percent discount rate:1975 ............................................................ 15.9 29.7 45.61980 ............................................................. 25.2 44.4 69.6(ii) Using 2.5 percent discount rate:1975 ............................................................ 15.9 50.4 66.31980 ............................................................ 25.2 72.3 97.5One of the measures of social trauma used in this report to indi-cate the impact of unemployment is suicide. Data used to developan estimate for the economic cost of suicide in 1980 were originallytaken from "The Cost of Mental Illness-1974" (16). The economicvalue of life lost through suicide is based on an estimate of the cur-rent market value of future earnings lost because of the suicide.The study mentioned above indicates that the cost of deaths due tomental illness in 1974 was estimated to be $4,942 million. To arriveat the percentage of deaths due to mental illness that are due spe-cifically to suicide, it was necessary to use an earlier study, "TheCost of Mental Illness-1971" (17). This study indicates that sui- 75cides represent 21.7 percent of the total number of deaths due tomental illness (the study assumes that all suicides were due tomental illness). Applying this percentage, the cost of deaths due tosuicide in 1974 is $1,145 million. Because 1975 is used in this analy-sis as the reporting year for economic costs, the 1974 cost of suicide($1,145 million) was adjusted for the 26.4 percent increase in aver-age wages between 1975 and 1978, resulting in $1,448 million for1978.Another measure of social trauma used in this report to indicatethe impact of economic distress is that of utilization of state mentalhospitals. Based on data in "The Cost of Mental Illness-1974," thedirect care expenditures for hospitalization in state and countymental hospitals were $2,756 million in 1974. First admissions tostate and county mental hospitals were 29 percent of total admis-sions in 1972. The $3,263 million direct care cost in 1975 was ad-justed for an increase in medical care cost of 42.19 percent between1975 and 1979, resulting in a rise to $4,640 million.Another element in the economic cost of state and county mentalhospitalization is the value of the time lost, as reflected in lostwages of individuals in these institutions. "The Cost of Mental Ill-ness-1974" indicates that in 1974, $4,524 million was lost to all pa-tient care activities. In order to find the percentage lost only tocare in state and county mental hospitals, it was necessary to usean earlier study, "The Cost of Mental Illness-1971." This study in-dicates that 54.3 percent of the value of time lost to all patient carefor mental illness can be attributed to state and county mental hos-pitalization. Applying this percentage to the total 1974 cost of timelost to patient care ($4,524 million) yields an estimated cost of$2,457 million of time lost to patient care in state and countymental hospitals in 1974. Similarly, the lost earnings in 1975 wereadjusted for a 37.56 percent increase in average wages, equalling$3,610 million.After adjustment of the 1975 data, the sum of the direct care costof $4,640 million and the indirect cost of the loss of potential earn-ings of $3,610 million for first admissions to state and countymental hospitals totalled $8,250 million in 1979. The table belowshows the estimates for 1975 and 1979.COST OF MENTAL HOSPITALIZATION(in millions]1975 1979Direct costs (of care).......................... .......................................................................................................... $3,263 $ 4,640Indirect costs (lost earnings) ............................................................ 2,624 3,610Total5................................................................................................................................................... 5,887 8,250c. Methodological Issues Related to Costs of CrimeMEASURESEfforts to determine the cost of crime generally consist of assign-ing money values to the consequences of criminal actions. While, at 76first glance, estimating the costs of crime might seem relativelysimple, there are problems involved in arriving at a figure that re-flects either the total of crime or that of specific crimes (18).One critical problem is the lack of agreement among those work-ing in the area as to what should be included in crime cost esti-mates. Some writers limit their costs to criminal justice system ex-penditures, while others include property losses, earnings madethrough criminal activities, or expenses on preventive measuresused by people to avoid crimes. Some researchers focus on indirectcosts, including losses to society resulting from crime. Others feelthat the costs of crime are inherently unquantifiable, especiallywhen one considers the fear of crime and the ways such fear alterspeople's livesThe fundamental problem is that there are no reliable measuresof crime itself-whether it results in reports to the police, death,arrest, imprisonment, or public reactions-for the actual amount ofcrime in society is unknown and inherently unknowable.In this report, five types of measurement were considered, relat-ed partly to the author's 1976 report. The first is lost productivity(based on forgone earnings) of victims. This measure was used in1976 to estimate homicide costs, in a manner similar to the cost es-timates of other forms of mortality, and is retained in this report.The second measure is based on the concept of underutilizationof imprisoned manpower. The concept is that each inmate is as-sumed to be capable of earning the mean household income (basedon census data) earned by employed members of the labor forcewith his educational and occupational background. Average earn-ings derived by this method adjust for the fact that inmates includea larger proportion of nonwhites than the population at large. Butno adjustment is made for the higher unemployment rate thatwould prevail among persons at high risk for engaging in crimeand becoming imprisoned (19). In addition, data on age-specific in-carceration were unavailable after 1973. Because of these problems,the present study does not calculate such costs of imprisonment.A third measure represents the costs of loss of money and physi-cal property due to property crime. In this report, we use thatmeasure in the estimate of white collar crime.A fourth measure involves criminal justice system (federal, state,and local) costs and includes expenditures for police protection,courts, legal services and prosecution, indigent defense, and correc-tions. This measure is used in the present study.A fifth measure involves the value of illegal goods and servicesthat are the products of organized crime; the vast majority of theseare narcotics and dangerous drugs. This measure, in addition to theforgone earnings of victims (of homicide), losses due to propertycrime, and criminal justice expenditures and related costs, wasused for the estimate of total crime costs. The estimates are alltaken from the Joint Economic Committee figures of 1976. For pur-poses of estimating economic costs of crime, the following indiceswere used: (1) homicide, which is only used to account for costs re-lated to mortality caused by homicide; (2) the arrest rate for fraudand embezzlement, which is used as an indicator of white collarcrime; and (3) the total arrest rate, which is used as a broad indica- 77tor of total crime, and, more narrowly, as an indicator of criminaljustice system activity.DOUBLE COUNTINGIt should be pointed out that, because of the difference in meas-ures of crime costs that are used in this study, one must be carefulto avoid double counting. For example, the costs of homicide mightinclude those of arrest, court adjudication, and imprisonment ofpersons responsible; the same costs might also be separately allo-cated to operation of the criminal justice system. Another commonexample is the confusion of the costs of drug abuse with those ofcrime, because of the tendency of the addicted population to use il-legal methods to support the drug habit. Because drug abuse usual-ly involves (costs of) crime, it cannot be reasonably added to thecosts of crime.This problem of double counting is most often an issue in crimecost accounting, but is also seen in the estimation of illness andmortality costs. For instance, for the population as a whole, thecosts of a high suicide rate might be understood to involve mentalhospital treatment of attempted suicides. Such costs attributed tosuicide should then not be added to those of mental hospitalization,where the intention is to obtain a broad estimate of the costs ofpsychological disorder.& Cost Estimates for CrimeThough estimates of the cost of crime must rely on a tenuousbase of information, the cost is clearly enormous. The direct costsof crime, its control, and prevention are massive. When the indi-rect costs resulting from loss of life, loss of income, and highercosts of goods and services are added, the costs rise even higher.From time to time, various agencies of government have tried tomeasure the economic impact of crime. In 1976, the Joint EconomicCommittee of the United States Congress published an estimate ofthe cost of crime that exceeded $125 billion per year (20, p. 26).HOMICIDEThe economic costs of homicide were estimated by using the 1974homicide statistics collected by the Division of Vital Statistics ofthe National Center for Health Statistics (21) and the Social Securi-ty Administration's estimates of lost earnings from death (12).Based on a conversion of the 1972 earnings into 1975 figures, it wasfound that the estimated 1975 economic cost of homicide mortalitywould have been over $5,406 million. This estimate was then ad-justed for a 49.3 percent increase in wages between 1975 and 1980.The 1980 economic cost of homicide mortality alone would haverisen to $8,076 million.WHITE COLLAR CRIMEThe second index of criminal activity employed in this study iswhite collar crime. White collar crime is among the fastest growingtypes of criminal activity. According to the Joint Economic Com-mittee projection of 1976, 35 percent of all crime is attributable to 78white collar crime. This encompasses, inter alia, bankruptcy, fraud,bribery, payoffs, computer crime, consumer fraud, illegal competi-tion, credit card and check forgery, embezzlement and pilferage, in-surance fraud, and securities theft and fraud. The estimated cost in1976, $44 billion, was adjusted for the CPI increase of 44.8 percentbetween 1976 and 1980. The outcome is a cost of $63.8 billion in1980 attributed to white collar crime.CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND TOTAL CRIMEThe arrest rate is taken, in this study, as an indicator of, at aminimum, criminal justice system costs and, at a maximum, totalcrime costs. The estimated cost of the criminal justice system, rep-resenting 18 percent of total crime costs in 1976, was $22.7 billion,according to the Joint Economic Committee Report of 1976. Thesecosts are inflated by 44.8 percent between 1976 and 1980, with aresulting figure of $32.9 billion for 1980.Overall crime costs, estimated by the Joint Economic Committeein 1976 as $125.2 billion, are similarly inflated by 44.8 percent be-tween 1976 and 1980 to yield a 1980 figure of $181.3 billion.PROBLEMS IN THE ESTIMATION OF SOCIAL COSTSThis study attempts to provide estimates of the social costs ofeconomic change for both the recent past and the near future(based on projections). First, however, it is necessary to delineatetwo problems caused by the preliminary nature of our calculations:(1) a comparatively small number of pathological indices that areused to represent "social costs," and (2) the fact that pathologicalindices measure extremely severe reactions rather than typical ef-fects. These elements point out that we have just uncovered thesurface in estimating social costs of national economic distress.The first problem is the relatively small number of pathologicalindices examined. The estimates presented here should be takenonly as indicative of the great breadth of pathological reactions inthe population. Although our present level of knowledge preventsaccurate measurement of the full amount of social pathology asso-ciated with economic trauma, we can asume that it exceeds the es-timates given in this report.Our second major problem in estimating the overall social costsis the use of extraordinarily severe measures of pathology. Theseextreme indices can theoretically be extrapolated to the larger con-ception of mental and physical ill health and criminal aggression.If we wish to estimate the total "human cost" or the monetary costof the impact of national economic distress in the light of thesebroad conceptual issues, then we must take into account two addi-tional levels of analysis.In the case of mental illness, we must extrapolate from mentalhospital admission to other forms of general medical care and, fi-nally, to the general mental health of the population, includingthose who do not receive care. For physical health, we must ex-trapolate from mortality to hospitalization and the use of primaryand secondary health care, and finally, to the general status of thepopulation's health, whether or not medical care is used. In consid-ering aggression, we begin with the extreme indicator of imprison- 79ment, and extrapolate to entrance into the criminal justice system(from arrest through conviction); then we must infer the behaviorof criminal aggressors, including those who are not arrested andwhose crimes are not reported, and finally extrapolate to the statusof the population with respect to the variety of serious aggressivebehavior.Perhaps we have underestimated the impact of these relation-ships because of data inadequacies, incomplete theoretical formula-tions, and confinement of the analysis to the national level. Theproblems of data inadequacy are evident in the case of admissionsto mental hospitals and prisons. The count of admissions is prob-ably accurate, but the degree to which hospitalization and impris-onment are reliable measures of serious mental disorder and seri-ous crime will vary with, among other things, administrative poli-cies of these institutions. Thus, the extent of mental disorder andcriminal aggression, of which institutionalization is one index, isnot only unknown, but may change through time. Moreover, trendsin the institutional indices of mental disorder and criminal aggres-sion are probably least sensitive to the effects of economic andsocial change simply because they display relatively little variabili-ty over time in comparison to non-institutional measures.The problem of incomplete theories with respect to the effects ofstress on serious pathology-let alone the effects of economictrauma on stress-have similarly been understated. The basic theo-ries have not been completely worked out, and few studies of thesephenomena at the individual level are available for use in nationalpolicy analyses. Thus, we have had to make several assumptionsabout the structure of such relationships on the national level, in-cluding a number of non-economic explanations of trends in thepathological phenomena. We do not presently have the data baseneeded to pinpoint which groups among the populations will bemost sensitive to national economic changes, which further re-stricts the sharpness of our analysis. We are forced to examinelarge populations, only a small proportion of which actually reactspathologically.Still, it should be noted that certain important factors that couldhave a bearing on types of pathology that individuals might showin response to economic trauma could not be dealt with in thisreport. Such factors include personality, political or religious per-suasion, and previous conditions of poor physical health or mentalhealth.The relatively consistent findings of the present study appear allthe more remarkable in the face of problems associated with datainadequacies, incomplete theories, and aggregate levels of anlaysis.It is therefore conceivable that under more nearly ideal study con-ditons the relationships would be found to show even greater statis-tical strength.We are quite aware, however, that the models offered here areby no means structurally complete. They represent only a second-stage research effort and are based on earlier scientific work inseveral different disciplines. The translation of theoretical positonand discovery into policy-oriented, empirical models was based.onrelatively simple assumptions of linear relationships between theeconomic and pathological indices. These assumptions of linearity 80are probably imprecise, because they do not take into account theduration and rate of change in economic distress. For example,they assume that a change in the unemployment rate from 2 to 3percent would have a pathological impact similar to that of achange from 7 to 8 percent. Increases at higher levels of unemploy-ment may have considerably more deleterious effects.DISCUSSION OF THE FINDINGS BASED ON RECESSION-RELATED INDICESUnemployment and business failures are the two principal reces-sion-related influences at all ages, judging by total and cardiovascu-lar mortality, but labor force participation rates, hours worked inmanufacturing, and annual changes in per capita income are alsouseful to describe other short-term impacts of recession. Becauseunemployment often shows a major effect after 2 or 3 years, it isdifficult to measure shorter lags using the same unemploymentvariable. The alternative recession-related indicators may be inde-pendent enough of the unemployment rate to allow observation ofeffects of recession that occur within less than 2 years.No short-term recession-related relationships were found to occurfor cirrhosis mortality. An age-specific income ratio, however, wasa significant contributor at all ages to the explanatory model. Itsuggests that, in the short run, doing relatively poorly constitutes ahigh risk situation for pathological drinking, or drinking and druguse combined. Also implicated are the stresses of social isolationand the delayed effects of unemployment, which may work to setoff the pathological processes that may result in death a decadelater.With respect to homicide, which also lacks a short-term reces-sion-related variable in the multivariate equation, there is probablyanother aspect of relative deprivation at work. All other indices ofcrime, it should be noted, are highly recession-related. With homi-cide, however, the unemployment variable is the youth unemploy-ment ratio, not an indicator of recession. We interpret this to meanthat the youth respond violently to a situation of sharp contrast be-tween comparatively good societal economic conditions and theirown chronic unemployment or underemployment with little pros-pect for improvement.A final observation is in order on the interpretation of the reces-sion indicators in the context of multivariate analyses. Becausemany factors are required to develop acceptable empirical modelsof hypothesized relations between recession-related loss and patho-logical response, it is not possible to consider the effects of any iso-lated variables. For instance, although a 10 percent increase in theunemployment rate may be associated with a 5 percent increase inmortality from some cause, it does not follow that one can see ex-actly a 5 percent change in the vital statistics a year or two afterthe rise in unemployment. Many other trends and changes are atwork simultaneously, either to raise or lower the actual rate. Onlyif other trends and changes were somehow controlled could the un-employment effect be isolated. 81RESEARCH PRIORrrIESOur findings further corroborate earlier research on the statisti-cal effects of economic declines on measures of social pathology.They also confirm the tradition of research on the inverse relation-ship between socioeconomic status and pathological consequencesof economic distress. The research in this paper allows the problemto be evaluated in terms of economic distress originating at leastpartly at the national level. The implication is that substantialcomponents of societal stress originate with economic maladjust-ments that, in turn, can be moderated through national economicpolicy actions.It is hoped that this effort will encourage research on the impactof economic policy on societal well-being. Solutions to many of themajor problems found in the work presented here will doubtless befound as research proceeds on the national and urban levels. It isprobably to the urban level, particularly, that we need to look for adetermination of the negative effects of long-term growth in eco-nomic affluence. It is on the urban level, moreover, that the largestdifferences in unemployment rates prevail. It is clear that we needto examine these relationships by comparing cities, states, indus-tries, and occupational groups.Comparisons should also be made at the international level. Ex-tension of this comparative research to other countries will bringus closer to understanding the sources of pathological response tochanges in economic conditions.Finally, a research priority is the determination of which compo-nents of economic growth have the most impact on the indices ofsocietal well-being. For example, it would be important to deter-mine what proportions of declining mortality are statistically relat-ed to increased availability and use of medical technology, to nutri-tion, or to the general decline in the physical and emotional stressof work life. It would also be important to break down the compo-nents of the CPI to determine whether price increases of specificgoods and services are most responsible for the pathological effectsor, in fact, whether it is the implication of changes in the incomestructure (related to changes in price levels) that is behind the rela-tionship of inflation rates and pathology indices.Refined applications that go beyond the use of the broad findingsof the present report require far more extensive analysis. Such re-search can be undertaken in both the national and subnational(even individual) levels of analysis. Efforts should be made to studypopulations that tend to undergo substantial economic difficultythat is heightened by national economic adversity. This is especial-ly true of many urban centers in the United States, where seriouspathological problems as well as high unemployment and relativeeconomic decline have coexisted in recent years. In addition, age,racial, occupational, and industrial groups that are particularlyvulnerable to the instabilities in the national economy represent apriority for substantial study, as it could provide the basis for tar-geting specific ameliorative economic measures to populationswhere they would provide the greatest benefit, in terms of both ef-fectiveness and efficiency. 82It is also important to evaluate the effects of non-economic ame-liorative programs on the physical health, mental health, andcriminal justice areas in light of national, regional, and local eco-nomic trends. It may be that, in many instances, the ameliorativeprograms are overwhelmed by the effects of the economic traumaand can only prevent greater pathology.Well-designed research at the individual level should help toidentify how strongly different kinds of economic trauma affect thetendency toward serious physical and mental health pathologiesand aggression in the population. For example, population cohortscould be followed and intensively examined over periods of severalyears to ascertain the effects of the economic changes specific totheir lives, as economic changes tend to be associated with specifiedpathological conditions.Studies of the relationship of economic change to societal patho-logies in individuals have often lacked controls for other risk fac-tors, focused too narrowly on employment status, and been inad-equate in size of sample. Research over the past several years hasshown that it is critical to consider the established risk factors forspecific pathologies, such as the controls in the present study forcigarette smoking and alcohol consumption in the analysis ofchronic disease mortality. Research has also revealed the pervasiveeffects of economic conditions in a family, work organization, com-munity, or region. Because recession-related losses are felt not onlyby the unemployed, but by their families, former co-workers, andneighbors, a comparison should be made between persons in re-gions or communities differentially affected by economic changes,not just between the unemployed and the employed. These analyticconsiderations will require large sample sizes if the results are tobe statistically meaningful.REFERENCES1. Rice, D. P. Estimating the Cost of Illness.

APPENDIX A-METHODOLOGYANALYTIC TECHNIQUESThe statistical analyses in this study were performed using theTime Series Processor (TSP) computer programs for multivariatetime-series regression analysis. Standard statistical procedures foranalyzing multiple variables were used. Routine tests for signifi-cance of individual variables and of complete equations are shownin the tables. The Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation of residu-als is also reported. Since it was found useful in all cases to trans-form the data to minimize serial correlation, the Cochrane-Orcuttprocedure was employed for this purpose; rho values are includedin the tables.Despite the theoretical strength of the models under study, inmany instances specific variables were not found statistically sig-nificant. Of these, several were omitted in the final equations be-cause: (a) their t values are near zero, (b) their presence as statisti-cal controls is not required, and (c) their presence tends to damagethe statistical significance of the overall equations (F or DWvalues). Several other variables whose t values are greater thanzero, but not technically significant, were retained in the finalequations if: (a) they are needed for statistical control and (b) theirpresence does not damage the statistical significance of the overallequations.DATA SOURCES AND LIMITATIONSThe data are those routinely used in this country for measuringa variety of economic and social conditions at the national level.Sources are listed at the end of this chapter. While generally theanalyses cover a time span from 1950 through 1980, exceptionsoccur on account of variations in the availability of data. Analysisbegins later when either the measure of societal pathology or someimportant control variable could not be obtained for earlier years.Similar problems arise at the end of the period. Analyses of mortal-ity by sex, age, and cause, for example, terminate in 1978 for lackof later cross-classified data. Total mortality and mortality for eachcause by age, but not cross-classified by sex, are analyzed through1980. However, the last two years of the series-1979 and 1980-are data estimated on the basis of a 10 percent sample of death cer-tificates. It is worth noting that such delays in the tabulation andpublication of basic national social statistics handicap researchersand policy-makers alike who require detailed current informationfor analysis and forecasting.(85)29-726 0-84-7 86TESTS OF VALIDITYTotal mortality and mortality for each of four causes were exam-ined by 10-year age groups for each sex separately (1951-78) andfor the sexes combined (1950-80). Nonwhite mortality in 10-yearage groups was analyzed for the period 1950-77. Where possible,e.g., arrests and mental hospital resident patients, each of theother categories of pathology was examined by age group. The pur-pose of the replications by demographic group and categories of pa-thology is to validate the findings on basic relationships. To theextent that consistency of results is observed among the many rep-lications for each of the main economic indices, additional confi-dence may be placed on the validity of the relationships associatedwith each of the indices.Two other factors made it desirable to examine the relationshipsbetween the economic and social indices by demographic groups.The relationships do, indeed, vary by age, sex and race. Thus, rep-resentation of the relationships only by the total rates of the patho-logical indices can be seriously biased by the influence of a minori-ty of subgroups which dominate the totals (e.g., the age groups over75 in the case of total mortality, or those over 65 in mental hospi-tal admissions).A second factor that would cause bias is that changes in the eco-nomic indices are often associated with changes in the demograph-ic structure of population. Disaggregation of the pathological indi-ces into age-specific components was used to deal with this prob-lem. Technically, then, specification of the pathological data byage, sex, and race was used to obtain more accurate estimates ofthe coefficients of pathology associated with the economic indices,and subsequent translation of those coefficients into numerical esti-mates.For the most part, however, it was decided not to utilize corre-sponding age/sex-specific unemployment rates or income measuresin the analysis of pathological indices classified by these demo-graphic categories. The most important factor in this decision isthat the correlation between fluctuations over time in the nationalunemployment rate and those in the age- and sex-specific rates isextremely high. This means that, over time, subgroup-specific fluc-tuations in unemployment rates are virtually indistinguishablefrom those in the national rates, although the size of the coeffi-cients would probably differ, and the resulting empirical modelswould be very similar. Furthermore, data for the subgroup-specificunemployment rates did not become available until 1947, whichconsiderably narrows the span of time available for analysis of re-lations with long lags.As a test of the assumption that the total unemployment rateand the age-specific unemployment rate would yield very similarresults, an appropriate age-specific male unemployment rate wastested in analyses of total mortality for both sexes in ten-year agegroups, starting with 25-34, for time spans ending in 1978 and1980. The test was limited to the shorter lags of unemployment,since the age-specific data are available only beginning in 1947.From the standpoint of interpretation of the relations betweeneconomic fluctuations and pathological indices, the use of sub- 87group-specific unemployment rates may actually be quite mislead-ing. Not only is there a lack of independence among the subgroupsin their unemployment rates over time, but there is a lack of inde-pendence among different age and sex groups in their social andeconomic status because they are bound together in family andother social units. Thus, the economic implications of unemploy-ment or income loss of a breadwinner may be quite substantial forthe entire family whose members are of diverse ages and bothsexes. A more realistic index of psychological stress due to incomeloss would be a measure of deterioration in family socioeconomicstatus, for which data are as yet unavailable.Apart from the economic interdependency of people of differentcharacteristics is the problem.of diffusion among different mem-bers of a family of psychological stress generated by economictrauma frequently mediated through only one member's relation-ship to the economy. For example, for a working wife the emotion-al stress of unemployment may bring about severe agitation, de-pression,. or deterioration in physical health status. Such conditionsmight have serious pathological implications for her relationshipswith family members, friends, neighbors, or other associates. Herhusband and children might well become hostile or withdrawn and'eventually exhibit adverse patterns of reaction separate from thoseof the person who initially encountered the economic trauma.Thus, although the initial mental stress has been encountered byone individual; what results is stress to the entire family or eventhe larger community. In situations where an entire family is un-dergoing stress initiated by the actions of one of its members, it is-often difficult to predict which of the members will actually showthe most serious pathological reaction. The probability of pathologi-cal-response will depend, at -least in part, on the previous mentaland physical condition of the individuals involved. To take thisproblem of diffusion one step further, ;it may be found that high-anxiety levels are generated among 'workers who are themselvesnot* unemployed, but who observe a high incidence of job lossaround them, and then become fearful for. their own employmentand income.THE PROBLEM OF CAUSAL RELATIONSThe.research techniques utilized in this study are essentiallybased on statistical correlation and regression analysis. As in allresearch based on correlation or regression, it is important to statethe caveat that one cannot -establish causation with these proce-dures. At most, one can test specific hypotheses grounded on soundtheoretical considerations and earlier- research findings. In thesetests, the hypotheses are either, supported or unsupported by thestatistical evidence. Even when they. are supported on the basis ofstatistically significant relations, they are not proven since the sta-tistical. tests only indicate whether or not the findings may result:from "chance" factors at specific levels of probability.In addition to the problem of lack of causal certainty is the issueof possible spuriousness, even for the relations found to be statisti-.cally significant. Regardless of stringent controls, outside influ-ences may have unobservable effects on the relationships. The pos- 88sibility remains that we have not taken all relevant factors into ac-count, especially since the state of our knowledge in the fields in-volved is incomplete. Thus, some unknown factor may be influenc-ing both the economic trends and those of the pathological indices.Finally, it is probable that the techniques of measurement used inconstructing the economic or social indices are not without someerror. To the extent that such measurement error exists, our re-sults may be biased.Having stated the caution on causal interpretation, we shouldnevertheless point out that the statistical techniques used in thisstudy are standard for the problems encountered, and do not neces-sarily involve greater error or bias than would be true in other re-search based on correlation or regression techniques.ANALYSISThe pathological indices, or the dependent variables in this anal-ysis, included: total mortality rate (age-, sex-, and race-specific); car-diovascular-renal disease mortality rate (age- and sex-specific); sui-cide rate (age- and sex-specific); admissions to mental hospitals; pa-tients in mental hospitals (age-specific); imprisonment rate; totalarrest rate (age-specific); selected serious crimes known to thepolice.From the standpoint of research strategy, we- are interested in asingle question. What is the empirical relation between economicchanges and pathology patterns, holding constant other aggregate-level factors which tend to influence those pathology patterns? Toanswer that question adequately, it is necessary to select controlvariables which, on both theoretical and empirical grounds, canhelp to explain the variance in the pathology patterns that is notappropriately accounted for by the variables which represent eco-nomic changes. To the extent that the control variables perform inthat classical manner, we will neither overestimate nor underesti-mate the importance of the economic variables.It is toward this end that a multivariate operational model of therelation between national economic changes and mortality rateshas been developed over the past several years. Theoreticallygrounded in the epidemiologic, demographic, and stress researchliteratures, the regression model includes factors associated with:(1) long-term growth in the economy; (2) economic instability-espe-cially recession as indicated by unemployment, income loss, busi-ness failures and recession-related declines in average weeklyhours worked in manufacturing industries; (3) physical environ-mental disturbances; and (4) deleterious behavioral risk factors his-torically associated with economic growth-especially alcohol andcigarette consumption per capita and measures of social isolation,such as divorce and living alone.LAGGED ENDOGENOUS VARIABLESMental hospital admission, mental hospital resident patients, im-prisonment, arrests, and crimes known to the police all involve in-stitutional intervention in the process that links incidence of initialpathology to official recording of the occurrence. These mentalhealth system and criminal justice system interventions impose 89trends -and cycles of their own on demographic changes in the re-corded data. It is these intervention-based trends and cycles thatfrequently give' institutional data "self-generating" properties.These properties in turn are measured by the lagged endogenousvariable. Lagged endogenous variables were utilized to measure thetrend of cyclic patterns of institutional activity in all cases wherefactors involved a "system" response to a specific pathology, inter-,vening between the incidence of pathology and its-offical record.ANALYSIS OF LAG RELATIONSAnalysis of the lag structures of each of the time-series relationswas accomplished in the following four -stages: (a) theoretical speci-fication of the relevant time span over which the relation may lag;(b) estimation of the actual range of statistically significant laggedrelations; (c) narrowing of the range of significant lagged relationsunder conditions of multivariate statistical controls; and (d) selec-tion of the optimum -lag, within previously determined range,under multivariate controls.The last stage, selection of the optimum lag, is the most difficultsince, in fact, the relations usually take place over several yearsand the "optimum" lag is either the strongest or the average. Theideal procedure, when degrees of freedom permit, is to express therelations in distributed lag form, typically polynominal. Thismethod can be used if we find the number of independent variablesto be relatively small, i.e., under six, for a given equation. In thecase of this study, however, the combined number of independentvariables and controls precludes the use of the -polynominal distrib-uted lag method due to insufficient remaining degrees of freedom.In order to illustrate points (a) and (b) of this procedure, let ustake, for example, the case of the unemployment rate in its theo-retical relation to the general mortality rate. We can specify, theo-retically, that three periods are involved in this relation, coveringan overall span of sixteen years. The first period-involving thefear and shock of major economic loss-covers less than two yearsincluding the zero year and the first lagged year. The second periodcovers the span of post-recession depressed employment, whichtypically last 2-3 years following an "ordinary" recession, and 3-5years -following longer and deeper recession, and culminates in eco-nomic.reintegration. But, for the population over 40, reintegrationprobably occurs only with another loss in socioeconomic status. Thethird .and fourth periods are those in which vulnerabilities arisingfrom the first 1-5 years of economic.loss and illness result in subse-quent illness and mortality. These vulnerabilities are greatly com-pounded by the occurrence of a new recession. -In this example, we have limited ourselves to a total span of in-vestigation of- lagged relations covering fifteen years. In the presentstudy, since the total period of analysis is from 1950 to 1980, it isunlikely that we will -be able to measure "cyclical" influences ofmuch greater than -fifteen years of lag. Empirically it has been ob-served in previous studies that lags of unemployment of about 7-15-years have tended to show positive relations to general mortalityrates. As a result of those earlier findings, we can, in the presentstudy, take the theoretical position that a principal -factor underly- 90ing the existence of those two relations is the vulnerability tofuture episodes of loss and illness of people who have once experi-enced major loss and illness, especially as engendered by the cyclicmovements of national economic activity.During the present study, it was again confirmed that patternedrelations do exist between the unemployment and mortality ratesat lags of greater than five years, and that the range of theselagged relations is 7-15 years. Further, the peak lags within thisrange were found at approximately 10-11 years. The hypothesiswas then once again entertained that it is specifically vulnerabilityto subsequent recession that tends to account for the peak lags,beyond five years, of the unemployment-mortality relationship.An examination was then made of the average distances betweenrecessions in the post-War period as they are recorded in the Busi-ness Conditions Digest. It was found that there tended to be arange of 10-11 years that is, indeed, so regular as to give the ap-pearance of a true periodicity of recessions at roughly each decade(i.e., 1949, 1960, 1970, 1980). These findings provided empirical sup-port for the view that the peak ranges and, especially, the peaklags in the unemployment-mortality relation actually reflect vul-nerabilities to the trauma of recession that are engendered by theexperience of past recessions.Subsequent analysis, nevertheless, determined that the peak lagsof approximately 10-11 years in the unemployment-total mortalityrelation were clearly .part of a longer distributed lag process. Thisdistributed lag process ranges over the entire span of 7-15 years. Itis evident that part of the reason for the relatively long span oflagged relations in total mortality is that it describes a composi-tional effect which reflects different lag patterns among categoriesof mortality which have different chronic disease causes. Thus, thecirrhosis of liver mortality-unemployment relations, over the longterm, tend to peak at approximately 9 years while cardiovascularmortality does so at 10-11 years (and subcategories of cardiovascu-lar disease, by age, also vary somewhat in their peak long-termlag).STABILITY OF THE RELATIONSIt is a matter of concern in time series analysis that relations berelatively stable across the time span of analysis. To the extentthat the relations-which can be understood as average relations-are unstable, they will be less appropriate for explanation of vari-ance, over any intervening span, or for forecasting. Also, it is rea-sonable to test the basic explanatory equations and especially thetheoretically crucial variables, for time spans that are not coveredby them.The principal explanatory equations were therefore tested for in-ternal 1950-1980 stability through the Chow test. This test splitsthe period in two-i.e., 1950-1965 and 1966-1980-and comparesthe resulting two fitted equations according to the magnitudes oftheir coefficients. Equations explaining mortality rates for the nineprincipal age groups (infants, 1-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74 and 75 and over) were analyzed in this way. The resultwas that no significant difference could be found between the two 91periods in the coefficients of the economic variables and almost allother variables. The only exceptions were that in two age groupsspecific control variables had to be removed from the equations inorder to achieve stability for the economic variables. For 15-24year old mortality rates cigarette consumption, divorce rates andthe proportion of the population. living alone were removed; for 65-74 mortality rates, spirits consumption was removed.Additional tests were performed using equations which were ini-tially fitted to 1950-1980 over the periods 1960-1980, for each of thenine groups. In all cases the short-run relations of the mortalityrates to recessional indices, especially the unemployment rate,were found at similar lags. For infant mortality the peak lag waszero; for -all other age groups the peak lag was at approximately 3years during 1950-1980 and 1960-1980, and 2-3 years during 1940-1960 and 1950-1970. For three time spans, 1950-1970, 1950-1980,1960-1980, the longer-term lagged relations between unemploy-ment. and mortality rates over age 45 were significant at 7-15years; for 1940-1960 those relations were significant at 9-12 years.PRINCIPAL DATA SOURCESPer capita real income: U.S. Bureau. of Economic Analysis.

APPENDIX B-DETAILED ANALYTIC TABLESSTRUCTURE OF THE APPENDIX TABLESEach of the Appendix Tables 1-33 describes one time series re-gression equation showing the relation between measures of eco-nomic change and indices of pathology, holding constant other riskfactors for health and social pathology as discussed in Chapter IVon the "Economic Change Model of Pathology." The Appendixtables only represent a fraction of the total regression equations onwhich this report is based. A full set of detailed tables is availablefrom the author.Five components are included in the Economic Change Model: (1)the exponential trend in real per capita income, (2) economic insta-bility, (3) economic inequality, (4) adaptational error associatedwith economic growth, and (5) random shocks.As reported in the Appendix tables, the outstanding statisticalrelationships are grouped in a manner by which they can be identi-fied with the five components of the Economic Change Model. Inthe Appendix tables, four major categories of variables are found:Economic, Behavioral, Family and Household, and Other Controls.The Economic variables in the Appendix tables include the Eco-nomic Change Model categories of: (1) the exponential trend in realper capita income, (2) economic instability, and (3) economic in-equality. The Behavioral and Family and Household variables in-clude those which in the Economic Change Model occur under (4)adaptational error associated with economic growth. Other Con-trols in the Appendix tables include the Economic Change ModelCategory of (5) random shocks. Other Controls also include thevariable rho, which is derived from the Cochrane-Orcutt procedurefor minimizing autoregression among residuals.To the immediate right of most of the variables, and in parenthe-ses, is the designation of the duration of lag in the relationships.The lag is in years (either the peak years of the relations or therange). If the range is designated, rather than the peak, the rela-tion is distributed over the years identified. For example (7-15) de-scribes lagged relations distributed over an-entire 7-15 year period;the coefficient and related statistics refer to the unweighted sum ofthe lagged relations. In those cases where no lag is designated inparentheses, the relation has been tested only at zero lag and istherefore only significant at that lag (i.e., for the exponential trendin real income per capita and the age/sex-specific labor force par-ticipation rate).The independent variables are used in one of three forms: rates,annual changes (of rates), and ratios. If neither annual changes norratios are actually stated in the variable name then the independ-ent variable is in rate form-i.e., even if the term rate is notstated. Annual changes refer to the year-to-year arithmetic(93) 94changes (or "first differences") in the independent variables. Ratiovariables either refer to measures of economic inequality or to alco-hol consumption. Ratios designating economic inequality are: (a)ratios of age/sex-specific unemployment rates to total populationunemployment rates or (b) ratios of age-specific median familyincome. Alcohol consumption ratios may be stated for specific bev-erages (spirits, wine or beer), and refer to the proportion of totalper capita consumption of alcohol that is attributed to the percapita consumption of any one beverage.The sequence of presentation of the tables is by major topic-i.e.,total mortality, cardiovascular-renal disease mortality, cirrhosismortality, suicide mortality, homicide mortality, state and countymental hospital resident patients, crimes known to the police, andarrests. In the full set of detailed tables all major topics are sub-classified by age and where possible by sex; total mortality is sepa-rately analyzed for the non-white population. On occasion, morethan one table (and thus more than one equation) will be presentedfor specific dependent variables. Where (1) different expressionswere nearly equally effective from a statistical viewpoint, and (2)demonstrated the theoretical importance of specified explanatoryor control variables, more than one equation is represented.APPENDIX TABLESMties TabLeTotal Mortality Rate, 1950-1980, by 10-year age groups ........................................ 1-6Cardiovascular-renal Disease Mortality Rate, 1950-1980, by 10 year agegroups............................................................................................................. .. 6-12Cirrhosis Mortality Rate, 1951-1978, Male, 45-54 and up ..................................... 13-15Suicide Mortality Rate, 1951-1980, Total, age 15:24 and 45-54 ........................... 16-17Suicide Mortality Rate, 1951-1978, Male, 45-54 and 55-64 .................... ............... 18-19Homicide Mortality Rate, 1951-1980, Total, 1-14 and 15-24 ................................. 20-21Homicide Mortality Rate, 1951-1978, Male, 15-24 .................................................. 22State and County Mental Hospital Resident Patients Rate, 1950-1979, Total,Age 25-44 and 45-64 ............... , , , , ..... 23-24Crimes Known to the Police, 1950-1980, By Crime ................................................. 25-30Arrest Rate, 1950-1980, Total, Age 18-24 and 25-34 .......................................,,,.31-32Fraud and Embezzlement Arrest Rate, 1950-1980, Total Population .................. 33 95TABLE 1.-MULTIPLE REGRESSION EQUATION FOR TOTAL MORTALITY RATE, AGE: 35-44-UNITEDSTATES, 1950-80[Lag, in years, in parentheses]Coefident T-StatisticEconomic:Income: Real income PC, exp. trend............................................................................. 1-0.776906E 3 11.6Labor force:Unemployment rate (2) ................................................. 2.231 2.188Unemployment rate (7-15) ................................................. 1.130 5.049Behavioral:Cigarettes (4-8) ................................................. .179E-03 5.519Spirits (0).................................................................................................................... .251 2.616Family and household: Living alone, annual change (0)....................................................... .651E-02 2.046Other controls:RHO............................................................................................................................ .556 3.66Constant........................................................................................................................ 1.156 2.514R.Squared=O.905Adusted R-Squared=0.88F-Statistic (6., 23.)=28.464Durbin-Watson statistic=1.794TABLE 2.
