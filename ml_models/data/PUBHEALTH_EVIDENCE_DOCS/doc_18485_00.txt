   3  INTRODUCTION
  On July 29, 1994, Jesse Timmendequas, a sex offender who had been released after 
serving a maximum sentence in a New Jersey correctional facility, rape
d and murdered seven
-year
-old Megan Kanka in Hamilton, New Jersey.  The intense community reaction that followed 
extended well beyond the state.  One expression of community outrage was the enactment of 
laws to notify the public of the presence of sex offe
nders living and working in their community. 
The premise was, and still is, that with this knowledge, citizens will take protective measures 
against these nearby sex offenders.  As Beck, Clingermayer, Ramsey and Travis (2004) note, 

expected is not clear, but it is hoped that, armed with this critical 
information, citizens will work on their own or in concert with government to make their 

 During the following decade, all 50 states and the District of C
olumbia enacted some 
version of such community registration and notification laws, collectively referred to as 

such as Washington, had enacted community notification l
aws prior to 1994, the federalization 
of community notification laws in 1996 created strong incentives for other states to follow suit 
(Presser & Gunnison, 1999). 
 
offe
nders must register their addresses with local police jurisdictions within a specified time of 
release from prison.  By way of the registration process, the public is then notified of the 

 to inform both the public and 
past victims so that they can protect themselves accordingly. 
As with other states, registration 
 
  4 and notification are separate steps in New Jersey, but are often referred to as one process.  
In 
New Jersey, offenders are place
d into one of three tiers, representing a hierarchy of potential risk 

-offense.  A ri
sk assessment instrument is 
used 
likelihood of re
-offense, which ultimately determines placement into the tier. Tier one repre
sents 
the lowest risk and requires only notification of law enforcement officials and the victims. 
Offenders are considered low risk and eligible for a tier one placement if they received a low risk 
assessment score and are on probation/ parole, receiving 
therapy, employed and free of alcohol 
and drugs. A tier two classification represents a moderate risk of a re
-offense. It requires 
notification of organizations, educational institutions, day care centers and summer camps. The 
factors for placement into a 
tier two category include a moderate to high risk assessment score, 
failure to comply with supervision, lack of employment, abuse of drugs or alcohol, denial of 
offenses, lack of remorse, history of loitering or stalking children and making threats (Brooks
, 1996; Matson & Lieb, 1997
; Witt & Barone, 2004
). Tier three offenders are those who are 
predicted to present the greatest risk to re
-offend. This category has generated the most legal 
resistance because it calls for the broadest level of notification. Th
e entire community is notified 
through posters and pamphlets. The factors necessary 
for the placement
 into a tier three category 
are a high probability of re
-offending evidenced by a particularly heinous instant offense or a 
high
-risk assessment score, rep
etitive and compulsive behavior, sexual preference for children, 
failure or refusal of treatment, denial of the offense and lack of remorse (Brooks, 1996; Rudin, 
1996; Witt & Barone, 2004
).   Despite their existence for over a decade, little work has been 
done to examine the 
effectiveness of these laws on sexual offense rates.  A few researchers, such as Beck and 
colleagues (2004), have conducted surveys to determine what protection methods community 
 
  5 members use when given information regarding the presence
 of sex offenders. Beck and 
colleagues (2004) approach their research from the viewpoint that community notification laws 
were enacted more to change the behaviors of potential victims than those of potential sexual 
recidivists. In this study, Beck and col
leagues (2004) differentiated between two types of 

-

initiated by fami
ly members to protect other household members (e.g., their children) 
(Beck & 
Travis, 2002).
   These studies found that community notification did, in fact, increase altruistic 
behaviors by community members to protect members of their households, although 
the findings 
are inconsistent with regard to whether self
-protective behaviors increased after community 
notification. Because of these results, Beck and colleagues (2004) posit that it is not the 
enactment of community notification laws themselves that in
fluences protective behaviors, but 

mediates these behaviors. This mediating factor presents problems for identifying the true effect 
of these laws on sexual recidi
vism rates.
  A few studies have also surveyed sex offenders to determine the impact that community 
notification laws have had upon them. Tewksbury (2005) found that 
social stigmatization, lo
ss of 
relationships, employment 
and housing, and bot
h verbal and p
hysical assaults we
re experienced 
by a significant minority of registered sex offenders
 (see also Tewksbury & Lees, 2006)
. Zevitz 
and Farkas (2000) also found that a majority of sex offenders reported negative consequences, 
such as exclusion from residence
s, threats and harassment, emotional harm to their family 
members, social exclusion by neighbors, and loss of employment. Furthermore, according to 
many tier three offenders interviewed, these laws would not deter them from committing future 
 
  6 sex offenses (
Zevitz and Farkas, 2000). In fact, Presser and Gunnison (1999) 
suggest
 that notification laws may be counterproductive in that public scrutiny causes additional stress to 
offenders who are transitioning back into the community. The fear of exposure may cau
se 
offenders to avoid treatment, and in the case of pedophiles, may encourage offenders to seek out 
children as a result of adult isolation. If these assumptions are true, the risk of recidivism may be 
increased (Presser & Gunnison, 1999)
, or at least such
 factors would work against any protective 
measures taken, thus lessening or eliminating any positive effect of the law
. None of the aforementioned research, however, addresses the critical question of whether 
community notification and registration laws a
ctually reduce sex offense rates (primary offenses 
or re
-offenses) in the communities in which the laws are applied, or what patterns of sexual

 That study, conducted in the 
state of Washington, compared sexual recidivism rates between two groups of sexual offenders: 
one released three years prior to the implementation of community notification law
s in that state, 
and one released three years after the implementation. The pre
- and post
- target groups were 
those most likely to be affected by the law (i.e., those who would qualify for tier three 
classification). To account for population differences, 
offenders in both groups were matched on 
the number of sex convictions and the type of victim (i.e., adult or child) (Schramm & Milloy, 
1995). Their analysis of potential grou
p differences revealed that a

.  Despite widespread community support for these laws, there 
is virtually no evidence to support their effectiveness in reducing either new first

offenses (through protective measures or general deterrence) or sex re
-offenses (through 
protective measures and specific deterrence).  
 The study described below investigates various impacts of community notification and 

 Law) in New Jersey. The primary areas of study are: 1) the effect of 

on re-offending, including the level of general and sexual offense recidivism, the nature
 of sexual 
re-offenses, and time to first re

-sexual re
-offenses (i.e. community

additional

effort to place sex crimes in the context of overall crime and a

 Sample and D
ata Collection
 This study is based upon a simple pre
-post research design to determine whether any 
significant changes in the rates of 
sexually based offenses reported by law enforcement agencies
 
w in late 1994.  Rates for sexually 
based offenses, non
-sexually based offenses, and drug offenses were collected for the years 1985 
through 2005 in order to construct a comparative trend analysis.  Data for the three types of 
crime were collected for all 
21 counties of New Jersey, using Uniform Crime Report (UCR) 
numbers for years 1985 through 2005. Prevalence rates for the three offense categories were

with the Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, a yearly federal government publication. 
Because no significant differences in population estimates were found between these t
wo 
sources, UCR numbers were used for trend analyses conducted in this study. In order to compare 
state and county trends in sexually based offenses, non
-sexually based offenses, and drug abuse 
violations, UCR aggregate numbers and prevalence rates for yea
rs 1985
-2005 were entered into 
an Excel spreadsheet and SPSS. 
 Definitions and Measures
 Uniform Crime Report statistics are based upon number of arrests, and as such, use of the 

e categories were 
 
  10 used for trend analysis comparisons: 1) sexually
-based offenses, 2) drug offenses, and 3) other 
offenses (non
-sex/non
-drug). Analyzing the single set of sex offense rates for the 21
-year time 
span provides an initial test of rate change. 
  Across the US, crime rates in general have been

 crime rate 
trends presents a visual contrast: (1) to confirm/disconfirm the national trends, and (2) to 
contextualize the sex
 offense rate trend within the general trends. Other offenses allow a control 
for New Jersey specific historical factors that might influence rates across crime categories, such 
as increased or decreased enforcement or prosecutorial budgets, the number of 
police or 

 Drug offenses, like sex offenses, have been the target of law enforcement policies. 
Although 
drug offense rates may change over time based upon what d
rugs are most common, 
drug arrests rates are also particularly vulnerable to changes in federal and local policies and law 
enforcement efforts.  
Furthermore, although the contrast between drug and sex crimes may not 
be immediately obvious, t
he inclusion of
 drug offense rate trends provides an opportunity: (1) to 
demonstrate the variations in rates over time, and (2) to evaluate whether these variations have 
similar patterns to those of sex offense rates.

 Analytic Strategy
 In studies of this type, typically a simple pre
-post test of rates is conducted to determine 
whether an intervention is successful.  Given that these data are points in time, namely crime 
rates by year, tim
e based strategies are commonly used, including time
-series/ARIMA models 
and regression discontinuity designs that allow for temporal autocorrelation. These analyses are 
constructed based upon a known change point.  
Although 

s passed in late 1994, it is not known when the agencies charged with implementing the law were 

may not have been 
uniformly implemented 
across the state
 at a standardized point
. The earliest change point that 
might be attributed to the 
legislation, therefore, is between 1994 and 1995.  Given delayed implementation, the true effect 
of the legislation may occur during a subsequent year. For this study, a method is required that 
will allow for the detection of suc
h delayed effects.
 Several authors have considered the problem of change
-points (see Pettitt, 1979 for 
a brief review).  Some make assumptions regarding the nature of the pre
- and post
-change sample 
distributions.  Most assume that the change
-point is know
n.  Pettitt (1979) offers a solution to the 
crime trend problem by suggesting a method of determining the most probable point of change 
 
  12 and using a non
-
summarized below.  
 A
T  and a change
-point at 
, where 
Xt for 
t 
 have a distribution function of F
1(x) and X
t for 
t = 
T have a 
distribution function of F
2(x) and F
1(x) 
 F2(x).  Since the change
-point is unk
nown, T-1  two sample comparisons are necessary
.  In the complete sample of 
T, Ut,T = 2Wt  t(T +1)
  where 
Wt  
is the sum of the 
ranks
 of all observations from 1 to 
t.  This produces a U statistic for 
each point in the time series comparing the mean of the
 series prior to 
t with the mean of the 
series after 
t. A version of the Mann
-Whitney U statistic, used to test that the two samples, X1, 
t  and X
t +1 T , come from the same population, is applied to the maximum U value:
 KT = max
Ut,T         
        1< 
t <
 T The approximation of significance probabilities that is associated with 
KT  is:      P  2 exp (
-6k2/ (T 2 + T 3)) where the approximation holds accurate to two decimal places for p< .5 (Pettitt, 1979).  
 This analysis employs this techniq
ue used to determine significant differences when the 
change point is unknown.  This technique was selected specifically because we did not want to 
make any assumptions regarding the implementation phase.  In most cases, where a law requires 
changes to pro
cedure, the effect is likely to be delayed by some unknown period.
  Data from the 21 New Jersey counties were entered separately, the New Jersey total was 

-to-year 
population changes at the state level.   For each county and for the state as a whole, the 
 
  13 yearly rates were rank ordered and a Mann
-Whitney U test was performed to test for a change in 
trend
.  Thus, for the state and for each county, every year is tested 
as a potential change point. 
  Results
 The results are organized into two major sections. The first section presents the trend 
analysis for both the state and for the individual counties. The second section contrasts the sex 
offense trend rates to trends i
n other offenses (i.e., drug and other non
-sex/non
-drug) over the 
same period of time.
 County and Statewide Sex Offense Rates
  Figure 1 displays the rates of sex offenses for New Jersey as a whole from 1985 to 2005.  
The rates varied from 51 offenses in 19
86 to a low of 29 offenses per 100,000 population in 
2005.  In general, there is a consistent downward trend. 
 Individual counties varied substantially both between counties and within counties over 
time.  Table 1 presents summary statistics of each county
 and the state as a whole.  Counties 
varied in population size from under 100,000 population in the smallest counties of Cape May, 
Salem, and Warren, to over three quarters of a million residents in the largest counties of Bergen 
and Essex.  The population
 size of the county is not consistently related to the rate of sex 
offenses.  For example, one of the largest counties, Essex County (Newark), has a relatively high 
rate of offenses (68)
, whereas 
the largest county, Bergen, has a relatively low rate (32). 
 In 
contrast, the highest rate of offenses is in one of the smaller population counties, Cumberland.  In 
the smallest counties, Cape May has a rate of 72 offenses per 100,000, 
whereas 
Warren has a rate 
of 36.
    
  14       Figure 1. New Jersey Sex Offenses per 1
00,000 Population from 1985 to 2005
   In 19 of the 21 counties, the year with the highest rate of sex offenses occurred before 
1994; Passaic and Sussex Counties were the exceptions.  In 19 of the 21 counties, the year with 
the lowest rate of sex offenses occurred after 1995; Morris and Passaic Counties were the 
exceptions in this case.  The rank trend tests (Mann
-Whitney U tests) revealed that (1) six 
counties had no statistically significant change point (Bergen, Hunterdon, M
ercer, Morris, 

Law (Burlington, Camden, Monmouth, Salem, Somerset, and Union). This means that only nine 

sed with the years of change falling 
between 1994 and 1998.  One final observation of county contrast should be noted. In several 

 
  15 in the last several years these 
counties have had substantial increases in sex offense rates 
(analyses not shown). This is true, for example, of Ocean, Hudson, and Warren Counties.

is followed by a spike the foll

sexual offenses most likely reflects increased surveillance and arrests, rather than increased

   Although 
individual counties vary, the aggregate state statistics indicate a significant 
change in trend in the year 1994 (MW
-U=110.0, p<.001).  Figure 3 displays the rates before and 

fenses for the years 
1985-1994, and the lower line represents sex offenses for the years 1995
-2005.  Superimposed 
on the yearly rates is a linear trend line. There are two important differences between these trend 
lines. First, beginning in 1995 the rate o
f sex offenses never again approaches the pre
-1994 
levels (i.e., the intercept and average are
 different). Second, the slope is steeper in the
 post-
fact that
 the decrease accelerates as the number of crimes decreases is unexpected.  In fact, one 
 
  17 might expect that an effective intervention would exhibit diminishing returns over time.  This is 
not the case in this instance.

  The aggressiveness with which arrest, prosecution and surveillance of specific crimes is 
pursued changes over time.  After Megan K

public sentiment demanded an immediate and aggressive response by law enforcement, the 
courts and corrections.  However, sex offenses are not the only crimes to receive this type of 
attention. The fede
ral War on Drugs was experienced at the state and local level as well.  Special 
task forces and interdiction programs resulted in vast numbers of arrests.  At the same time, the 
crack epidemic hooked thousands of individuals.  It is difficult to disentangl
e the effects of law 
enforcement and prosecution efforts from addiction trends.  In the case of sex offenses, the trend

existing rate reduction momentum. The first set of 
analyses addressed this point. The second concern is to control for historical effects.  Drug 
offenses, like sex offenses, should reveal rate patterns consistent with intervention efforts.  Other 
crimes sh
ould be more resistant to these specialized influences, but sensitive to larger social and 
political influences.  The following analyses contrast the statewide sex offense trends with drug 
and other non
-sex/non
-drug offense trends.
  Figure 4 displays the r
ates of non
-sex (non
-drug) offenses. The average number of crimes 
per 1,000 population is 50.0 with the highest rate of offending at 56 in 1989 and the lowest at 45 
in 2003.  As illustrated, there is a consistent increase in crime rates in the late
 
 followed 
by a five
- year decline. Over the next several years the rates increased again, only to drop to their 
lowest levels in recent decades.  For the last five years the rate has remained stable at about 45 
crimes per 1,000.  In these data, there is a 
significant change point in 1998 (MW
-U=98.00; 
p=.005), indicating that the levels of crime prior to 1998 were significantly higher than those 
after 1998.

-sex /Non
-drug Offenses per 1,000 Population from 1985 to 2005
  
  19   Unlike general crime, drug
-related crimes showed very different rates by year. On 
average, there are 68 drug crimes per 10,000 population.  This varied from a high of 89 in 1989 
to a low of 52 in 1985.  As can be seen in Figure 5, drug 
crimes spiked in 1989, then dropped 
precipitously. 
Although 
the rates increased again following 1993, this never again approached 
the 1989 rate.  The most recent decline appears be to be stable at around 65 crimes per 10,000 
and has not achieved the 1985
-86 rates.  
There is no significant change point.

  20   The general decline
 in sex offenses in NJ
 is similar to that of non
-sex
/non
-drug
 crimes.  
However, th

implementation year (i.e., 1994), 
whereas
 the change in trend for non
-sex crimes occurred later, 
in 1998.  The wide year
-to-year fluctuations in drug crimes in fact may reflect speci
fic policy 
and practice efforts, although those efforts were not sustained.  In the case of sex offenses, the 
statewide change occurred when it was predicted to change and has maintained its impact over 
time.
    PHASE TWO: SEX OFFENDER OUTCOME STUDY
  Metho
dology
 Phase Two of the National Institute of Justice grant used a sample of sex offenders 
released from New Jersey Department of Corrections facilities (either the Adult Diagnostic and 
Treatment Center [ADTC] or one of the general population facilities) b
efore and after the 
 
  21 
the general population) were randomly selected for the period covering 1990 through 2000, 11 
years in total.  This yielded a sample of 550 cases. 
 For each of these case
s, extensive demographic, clinical, institutional and service use, 
criminal history, and crime offense characteristics information was collected.  This provides an 
opportunity to contrast outcomes (i.e., recidivism, time to failure, 
and harm variables) of 

released after the legislation passed. 
 This component analyzed pre
-post group differences on three outcomes:
  Reduced recidivism
- including re
-arrests, re
-convictions, and re
-incarceration;
  Increased community tenure
- including days to first arrest and days to first arrest for a 
sexual offense; and/or
  Reduced harm
- including fewer sex offenses, less violent offenses, and fewer child 
victims
.    The following sections present offender characteristics, bivariate differences in characteristics, 
and pre
-post group outcomes.
    Results
 Demographic Characteristics
  Table 2 displays the demographic characteristics of the sample.   The sample is 
com
prised only of males.  Half of the sample is white 
with black and Hispanic offenders 
accounting for 35% and 15%, respectively. Only 0.2% of offenders classified themselves as 

 were married 
 
  22 at one time and 66 percent had at least one child (including stepchildren).  On average, each 
individual had 1.9 children (sd=2.1).

cent only achieved 
an eighth grade education, 
whereas 
36 percent attended high school, but did not graduate. 
Twenty
-five percent completed high school and 8 percent obtained a GED. Sixteen percent had 
some college education with 4 percent completing an Ass
ociate Degree or higher. Sixty
-three 
percent had an employment history of a year or greater prior to committing the offense. Although 
most offenders reported some variety of employment history, the median years of employment 
was considerably low, at less t
han three years of past employment. Of those who had been 
employed, most had held unskilled or trade jobs (75%) or jobs in the service industry (13%). A 
notable 8 percent held white

  23 income, 25% reported an income of $20,000 or less, 5% reported an income of $21,000 to 
$30,000, 3% reported an income of $31,000 to $40,000, 1% reported an income of $41,000 t
o $50,000, and 0.5% reported an annual income of $50,000 or higher. 
 Clinical Characteristics
  This section includes measures commonly associated with risk (e.g., history of abuse, 
familial criminal justice involvement), behavioral health problems, and pas
t treatment 
experiences. Table 3 displays these measures

 88.4  Most offenders were raised in either a traditional two
-parent home (66%) or in a mother
-only headed household (23%), and the majority of offenders did not report any history of child 
abuse (6
1%).  Twenty
-six percent, however, reported having experienced sexual abuse as a child. 
A large majority of offenders (91%) did not have any family members involved in the criminal 
justice system.  
 Only 23 percent of offenders reported some type of past m
ental health problem. These 
mental health issues included problems diagnosed in childhood (e.g., emotionally disturbed, 
developmental disorder) as well as more common diagnoses problems such as depression. In 
addition, a sizeable proportion of offenders ha
d a drug or alcohol abuse history, with 45% 
reporting a prior drug abuse problem and 47% reporting a prior alcohol abuse problem. 
  
  24  Thirty
-five percent reported having received mental health treatment in the past. Most 
offenders (94%) were reported as rece
iving some type of sex offender treatment while 
incarcerated. A majority of offenders (88%) also received treatment in addition to the standard, 
mandated treatment groups. Types of adjunct treatment offered to inmates included adult basic 
education classes
, life/social skills groups (e.g. anger management), and drug and alcohol 
counseling.
 Offender Criminal History 
  Offender criminal history includes information on prior arrests. These data are presented 
in Table 4.  
 In general, the men incarcerated for a
 sex crime were more likely to have been 
engaged in previous non
-sex crimes than in sex crimes per se.  Sixty
-five percent had a previous 
arrest for a non
-sex crime.  On average, they had been arrested 3.4 times (sd=5.77) and were 
arrested for the first ti
me when they were 21.5 years old (sd=8.21).  Only 27 percent had been 
previously arrested for a violent crime with an average of .5 prior arrests (sd=1.07).  Even fewer 
(24%) had been arrested for a sex crime in the past, with an average number of .4 prior
 arrests 
(sd=1.02). On average, these offenders were 24.8 years old (sd=9.01) at the time of their first 
arrest for a sex crime.  Only 6 percent had been arrested as a juvenile for a sex crime.

  25  Table 5 displays information regarding the sex crime(s) for w
hich the men in the sample 
were serving sentences. Eighty percent of offenders were serving time for child molestation 
(incest=21% vs. non
-incest=59%). Cases of rape and general exhibitionism accounted for 20% 
and 0.4% of all cases, respectively. 
 Sixty
-two percent of offenders denied committing certain acts of the instant crime, or 
denied the sexual offense in its entirety. Most often, offenders in this latter group denied the 
more egregious acts of the offense (i.e. penetration) or instances of multiple a
cts. According to 
police reports, however, a majority of offenders (55%) engaged in multiple acts over a period of 
time, and in 26 percent of the cases the offender had multiple victims.
 The 550 offenders in the sample victimized a total of 796 individuals
.  That is an average 
of 1.45 victims (sd=1.07) per offender for the current offense alone. However, this number is 
skewed.  In 74 percent of the cases, there was only one victim identified. Of the cases involving 
two or more victims, the average number of
 victims was 2.7 (sd=1.49). Of the victims, 79 
percent were female and 30 percent were male. These percentages include the cases where both
 males and females were victims (8%). The mean age of victim in the index offense was 12.3 
years old (sd = 9.74). Age
s of victims spanned from 1 year to 87 years old; 65 percent of the 
victims were 12 or younger, 24 percent were between 13 years old and 18, and the remaining 11 
percent were 19 or older.

 Criminal Justice Factors
 On average, offenders were sentenced to nearly nine 
years of incarceration (104 months, 
sd= 63.8), with the most frequently imposed sentence being five years. The minimum and 
maximum imposed sentences for the sample were one year and 36 years, respectively. In 
actuality, offenders served approximately five 
years on average (56 months, sd=40.4), with time 
served ranging from three months to 21.5 years. Only 32 percent of offenders were paroled 
whereas 
68 percent maxed out; leaving the prison with no post
-incarceration supervision 
requirements other than those
 
 Table 6. Criminal Justice Factors
    Sample Equivalences
  In studies that 
use random sampling it
 is assumed that the samples will be equivalent in 
all relevant factors. This is, however, an assumption, and statistical theory suggests that although 
rare, samples may be found to differ.  In this case, it is known that samples differ temporally.  
The di
fferences in cohorts may be reflected in institutional responses (e.g., changes in court 

social or community behavior (e.g., increases or drops in specific dr
ugs of choice or type of 
crime), or other historical sociopolitical changes.  Bivariate analyses were conducted to confirm 
offender similarity in: demographics, risk factors, and prior criminality; all known to associated 
with the likelihood of recidivism.

  28  No statistically significant differences were found in demographic characteristics. Among 
the risk factors, only receipt of other treatment services was significant (with the earlier cohort 
more likely to have received services [95% vs. 83%;
 2 = 14.6, df=1, p<.001])
. In terms of 
criminal history, no variable was found to be significant except for the average number of prior 
sex offenses (with the earlier cohort averaging a higher number [.56, sd=1.16 vs. .32, sd=.87; 
F=7.21, df=1, 546, p=.00
7]). Among the target offense variables, only alcohol use was 
significant (with the earlier cohort more likely to have used alcohol during the commission of the 

2 = 6.09, df=1, p=.014]).  Thus of the over fifty variables analyzed, only
 three were significantly different between groups.  Again appealing to statistical theory, with 
multiple tests there is an increased likelihood of detecting significant relationships. No correction 
was made in these analyses to account for this threat.  H
owever, given the vast number of 
equivalencies, these groups are assumed equal for purposes of the outcome analyses. 
 Offender Outcomes Pre
- and Post
-
 Before presenting pre
-post contrasts that are controlled by time at risk, ye
ar-by-year 
graphs demonstrate several important points that must be kept in mind when interpreting the 
remainder of the analyses.  The outcome measure of recidivism was collected through June 15, 
2007.  The remaining measures were adjusted to assure that a
ll offenders had an equal time at 
risk, specifically 2,358 days or approximately six and a half years. Figure 6 presents the percent 
of offenders released in each year who generally recidivate within the follow
-up period (i.e., 6 ½ 
years).  In this case, t
his figure presents the percent of persons who are re
-arrested, the percent of 
the sample re
-convicted and the percent re
-incarcerated.  Clearly, these are three closely linked 
outcome measures (e.g., conviction cannot occur in the absence of a chargeable 
offense).  
  
  29 Figure 6. General Recidivism by Year
  Overall, 46 percent of offenders were re
-arrested (9 percent were re
-arrested for a sex 
crime), 41 percent were convicted, and 35 percent were re
-incarcerated.  
Although 
the figure 
shows substantial moveme
nt up and down over time, there are no significant differences by year 
(this is largely a power problem).  Further, excluding the year 1995, all measures of recidivism 
are declining over time from highs in the 50 to 60 percent range in the 1990 release coh
ort to the 
25 to 40 percent range in the 2000 release cohort. What is interesting about this figure, however, 
is the rates relative to each other within year.  In most years, a stable percentage of persons who 
are arrested are convicted. In this sample, ov
er the 11 years, 88 percent who are arrested are 
convicted. Of those convicted, 86 percent are incarcerated as a result.  However, these rates vary 
from year to year.  For example, of the 1993 release cohort 46 percent were re
-arrested; of those, 
96 percen
t were convicted; and of those convicted 96 percent went back to prison.  In 
comparison, of the 1995 release cohort, 56 percent were re
-arrested and nearly all were convicted 
(96%), but only 70 percent of those convicted were re
-incarcerated.  It is not cl
ear from these 
data whether the year
-to-year differences are a result of procedural and administrative changes or 
a reflection of a system response to public pressure.
  
  30 Recidivism
 Table 7 presents the comparisons of the pre
- and post
-implementation groups o
n all 
outcome measures, including recidivism, community tenure and harm
 (sexual re
-offending)
.  In 
the 
recidivism
 section, all measures (i.e., arrest, conviction and incarceration) are 
significant.  In all three variables, the post
-implementation g
roup has a lower percentage of cases 
that have experienced the outcome. 
  This is for general recidivism.  Forty
-one percent of the 
post-implementation group was re
-arrested compared to 50 percent of the pre
-implementation 

2= 3.94, 1 df, p=.047).  
Similarly, 34 percent of the post
-implementation group was 
convicted compared to 46 percent of the pre
-
2= 8.59, 1 df, p=.003). And 
29 percent of the post
-implementation group was re
-incarcerated compared to 40 percent of the 
pre
-impl

2= 7.53, 1 df, p=.006).

       Community Tenure
   Time to failure is an important outcome measure.  Situations may exist where equal 
percentages of experimental and comparison groups demonstrate an outcome
, in this case, re
-arrest, but the average l
ength of time to the arrest differs.  Even in the case where equal 
percentages of pre
- and post
-implementation subjects are re
-arrested, more days in the 
 
  31 community without committing a crime
2 reflects improved outcomes in community and personal 
harm, as we
ll as cost savings.   
  The average time to an arrest for any type of crime was 753 days (sd=628) or about two 
years, one month (see Table 6).  There was no significant difference by implementation cohort.  
The average time to an arrest for a sex offense w
as 795 days (sd=690) or about two years, two 
months.  
There was no significant difference by implementation cohort for this variable.
  A survival analysis was also conducted on these data to determine whether the rate of 
failure by time at risk varies sign
ificantly by implementation cohort.  Figure 7 displays the 
survival curves for the two groups.  Cases that experienced an arrest are designated by their 
inclusion in the continuous curve (i.e., continuous line), cases that were not arrested are censored 
and are represented as pluses.  The strength of this analysis is the inclusion of censored cases.  
They are included with the time value computed as the time from release until the last day of 
data collection (i.e., June 15, 2007).  
  The curves reflect seve
ral facts: (1) all cases are censored if their time at risk exceeds 
2358 days regardless of whether they were arrested or not, (2) 60 percent of post
-implementation 
cases compared to 50 percent of pre
-implementation cases survive (i.e., have not been arres
ted)
3, and therefore visually demonstrating the cohort difference in overall re
-offending, and (3) the 
curves, while diverging a small amount, are proportionally similar across time at risk, thus 
reflecting no significant difference in the failure rate (co
nfirmed by statistical tests, including the 
log-rank test).

any crimes.

  32   Reduced Har
m by Deterring Sexual Re
-offending
  Re-arrests for sexual offenses do not significantly differ year to y
ear (see Figure 8).  
Holding time at risk constant, 9 percent of the sample has been re
-arrested for a sex crime, 
representing about 19 percent of the arrest charges.  This varies from a high of 14 percent in 
1991 and 1992 to a low of 6 percent in 1994, 19
95, and 2000.
 Pre
- and post
-implementation groups do not differ in the percent of persons re
-arrested 
for a sex
 crime (10% vs. 7.6
%).  Of the 48
4 cases represented in the sexual re
-offense type 
analysis, 60 percent were charged with child molestation or in
cest, 16 percent with rape and 24 
percent with another type of sex offense, including voyeurism and exhibitionism.  The pre
- and 
post-implementation groups also did not differ significantly on sex offense type.

ls were re
-arrested on a sex 
charge: 13.2% of the pre
-implementation group with between 4,565 and 6,386 days at risk and 9.7% of the post
-implementation group with between 2,374 and 4,561 days at risk.
  
  33    As a side note, t
he percentage of violent crimes, excluding sex crimes, was also 
investigated.  Overall, 28 percent of the sample was re
-arrested for at least one violent crime.  

lemented were re
-arrested for a violent crime compared to 32 percent of the pre
-implementation cohort.
 PHASE THREE: COST STUDY
 Methodology
  The final stage of this research grant proved to be the most challenging, as delineating 
costs associated with commu
nity registration and notification were difficult to disentangle
 from 
other state and county level spending
.  
The research team mailed a cost assessment questionnaire 

of the 21 county
 
 Law 
Units are responsible for the enforcement and administration of community notification and 
registration statutes in New Jersey (i.e.
, 

, tier class
ification), door to 
door/community notifications, trainings (e.g.
, law enforcement, day care center employees), 
prosecution/litigation, internet registry maintenance, etc.
  
  34 Prior to mailing the cost assessment questionnaires, the research team met with Assi
stant 
Prosecutors in order to review questions contained in the survey and to address any questions 
prosecutors may have had in completing the survey. Survey questions were subsumed under two 
general categories: start up costs and ongoing yearly implementa
tion costs. 
 Specifically, startup costs include those initial costs associated with the establishment of 

establishment of the internet sex offender registry, equipment cost
s, and other/miscellaneous 
costs (e.g. computer software). Ongoing costs consist of expenses such as staff salaries, internet 
registry maintenance, equipment maintenance/supplies, and other/miscellaneous expenses (e.g. 
mailings, printings, software updates
, etc.). Survey questions concerning on
-going expenses 
pertained to costs accumulated during the calendar year ending 2006.  
 In addition, a section concerning percentage of time allotted to job tasks (i.e. itemized 
according to staff title) was included a
nd was to be completed for all staff working within each 

percentage breakdown of time allotted to specific job functions such as risk assessment, door to

cations, training, etc. was required.
 Of the 21 coun
ties that were surveyed, 15
 surveys were completed and received by the 
research unit, for a total response rate of 71.4 percent. Upon receipt, researchers scanned survey 
responses for possible misreading/
interpretation issues related to specific survey items. For 
additional clarification, researchers called county prosecutor offices to confirm questionable 
survey item responses and made any changes accordingly. After survey responses were finalized, 
an Exc
el database of cost assessment variables was created for analysis.
  
  35 Along with the cost assessment survey, prior 
New Jersey state budgets
 were reviewed for 
costs associated with the incarceration, rehabilitation, and tracking of sex offenders.
  Specifically

 Moreover, original 
grant documentation and archived folders were also reviewed for costs not included or found in 
the other sources. 
Sources were challenging to locate, as was the origin of muc
h of the funding.  
 Results
 The results that follow include
 statistics based on the 15
 counties that responded to the 

sessment Survey. For the 15
 responding counties, the initial 
aggregate

establishment of the internet sex offender registry
 accounted for 
$186,190, an average of $31,032 
(sd=$24,140) per county, equipment accounted for $232,407 ($19,367

                                                  5 As noted, fifteen out of a possible twenty one counties in New Jersey responded to the cost assessment survey, which translat
es to an 
approximate response rate of 71.4%. In order to provide a more accurate assessment of initial and on going costs statewide
, said costs 
were interpolated by adding 28.6% (i.e. 100% 
- 71.4%) to the implementation and ongoing grand totals of the fifteen responding 
counties. . In effect, using this general interpolation method, implementation costs were estimated to be $714,457 a
nd ongoing costs were 
estimated to be $5,110,477 statewide. Again, because these figures are interpolated, these costs do not take varying county d
emographics 
into account and should be interpreted with this caveat.

 As a preliminary step in assessing the effect of community registration and notification 
laws on sexual arrest rates in New Jersey, the goal of the trend study was to explore crime trends 
and
 to identify possible changes over a 21
-year period. Specifically, the main research areas 
concerned the patterns of sexual offense rates both prior and subsequent to the implementation of 

n sexual, 
drug, and non
-sex/non
-drug
 based offenses during the same time period. 
The results presented in this report support findings 
by other researchers exploring relevant topics. Most notably, 
Finkelhor and Jones (2004) found 
that there has been a consistent dow
nward trend in child sexual abuses cases since the early 
1990s. This trend analysis did indeed find a significant change in the
 statewide decreasing sex 

 implemented, which may lead some readers to believe 
that the l
egislation
 is solely responsible for the decl
ine. Because sex offense rates 
began to 
decline well before the passage of
 
drop in
 general. It may, in fact, be the case that continuing reductions 
in sex
 offending in New 
Jersey, as well as across the nation, are a reflection
 of greater societal changes.  Having said this, 
it is nevertheless hard
 to explain the steeper decline in rates after the implementation of
 
Law. Given that sex offenses 
are low base rate events, the
 finding that these rates continue to 
 
  38 decline at an accelerated rate
 after 1994 suggests that something other than a natural decline may 
be responsible.  
Although
 the initial decline cannot be attributed to
 
tinued 
decline may, in fact, be related in some
 way to registration and notification activities.
  However, 
there may well be additional factors causing this steeper rate of decline after 1994, perhaps some 
attributable to other public policies.  For exampl
e, in 1998, New Jersey began civilly committing 
those sex offenders found to present the highest risk to the community, termed sexually violent 
predators.  Assuming the accuracy of the risk assessment that underlies the civil commitment of 
these sexually v
iolent predators, 
then those at highest risk to reoffend have been removed from 
the community, thereby potentially lowering the sex offense rate.
  Although, the number of 
civilly committed sexual predators only includes approximately 350 sex offenders.
 Moreover, t
his statewide finding 
of a declining sex offense rate 
should be taken with 
considerable caution.  The
 variation in the pre
-post-implementation rate trends at the county 
level
 suggests that the statewide effect may be an artifact of the aggregation
 process. 
Although
 many counties (9 of 21) follow the state trend, many
 others show no differences in rates over 
time or have experienced
 reductions followed by increases to near pre
-
 so, with only two exceptions, the rates of sex of
fending were highest
 prior to 1994 and lowest 
after 1995, with the most recent years having
 the lowest rates. Differences in population, socio
-political status,
 policing and prosecutorial resources may be related to differences in
 the effectiveness in noti
fication and surveillance activities in
 specific counties.
 Although
 impossible to distinguish the nature of the effects, the
 reductions of sex 
offenses is related to some historical process: either
 (1) registry/notification, surveillance and/or 
aggressive 
prosecution
 
  
  39 reductions or (2) general public awareness, publicity, and/or exclusion
 and intolerance feed the 
continued decline.  Most likely, it is a
 combination of these factors.
 In the offe
nder release sample, there is a consistent downward trend in re
-arrests, 
reconvictions and re
-incarcerations over time similar to that observe
d in the trend study
, except 
in 1995
, when all measures spiked to a high for that period. This resulted in signifi
cant 

implemented). Similarly, re
-arrests for violent crime (whether sexual or not) also declined 
steadily over the same period resulting in a significant difference betwee
n cohorts (i.e., those

  In all other pre
-post measures, includ
ing other measures of recidivism, community tenure 
and harm reduction
 (decreased sexual offending)

were found.

nt in the community prior to re

 re-offenses;
 o changing the type of sexual re
-offense or first time sexual offense
 (for example, 
from hands
-on to hands-off offenses)
; or o reducing the number of victims involved in sexual offenses.
   Costs associated with the initial implementation
 
 as well as ongoing 
expenditures
, continue to grow over time.  Start up costs totaled $555,565
 in 1994
 and now 
curren
t costs (in 2007) total 
approximately 
3.9 million dollars.  Given the lack o
f demonstrated 

 researchers are hard
-pressed to determine that the escalating costs are 
justifiable.
 Limitations
  
  40 Conducting a study of this type with sensitive sexual arrest data introduces a number of 
limitations.  The most noted
 problem plaguing sexual offense research, the low base rate of 
reported sexual offenses, is tied to the under
-representation of official data.  Because sexual 
offenses are under
-reported, most measures of recidivism under
-represent the true offending 
rate
s (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1999; Belknap, 2000; Furby et al., 1989; Hall, 
1995; Hanson & Bussiere, 1998).  It has been suggested that the present statistics on sexual 
abuse represent approximately one
-third of the number of actual victimiza
tions, leaving 

Belknap, 2000; Chesney
- Lind, 1997).  Legal definitions, fear and shame, and a desire for 
privacy are the main contributors to the unwillingness of m
any victims to report their abuse.  
Conversely, it has been noted that some types of sexual abuse may be over
-represented to the 
police, such as stranger rapes (Belknap, 2000).   For example, victims of stranger rape, as 
opposed to incest victims, may be m
ore inclined to report their sexual victimization because their 
perpetrator is unknown. This disparity may lead many to believe that stranger victimizations 
occur more frequently than other types of sexual victimizations because the reports may appear 
disproportionately higher (Zgoba & Simon, 2004).  
Although
 most individuals know that 
acquaintance or familial crimes are more frequent, these factors may make it difficult to achieve 
a clear picture of sexual offense rates (Belknap, 2000; Chesney
- Lind, 1997)
. Given this low base 
rate of reporting, it is notable that sex offenses decrease rapidly in the post
-
the fact that the decrease accelerates as the number of crimes decreases is unexpected.
  Another issue that has been difficult to full
y address in the format of this study is whether 
the noted decreases in the post
-

 
  41 known sex offende

idea of notification and increased surveillance may have a general deterrent effect.  Further, 
increased attention and public contempt of sex offenses and offenders may also contr
ibute to 
general deterrence.  This study illustrated downward trends in sexual arrest rates, but cannot 
differentiate whether the reduction is due to decreases in new first
-time sex offenses (general 
deterrence) or to decreases in sexual re
-offenses (speci
fic deterrence).  
 One of the largest challenges
, and a subsequent limitation
, associated with this 
grant 
was 
obtaining 
the financial 

County Prosecutor Offices, as well as the 
offices dealing with Treasury and Budget, had the 
same difficulties the researchers experienced 
when 
attempting to isolate and identify the costs listed in the State of New Jersey
 Budgets.  
Furthermore, initial start
-up costs were 
sometimes 
funded through grants 
that providing 
few 
specifics
 regarding disb
ursement patterns
.  In an effort to provide close estimates, the researchers 
developed proxy measures that
 should be read with some 
caution.  
 Conclusion
 Despite wide community support for these laws, there is 
little 
evidence to date, including 
this study,
 
-time sex 
offenses or sexual re
-offenses.  
Continuing research should focus on matching samples of sex 

ning levels of 

Further research will be conducted utilizing the data 
accumulated here, specifically exploring low base rate offending and potential predictors of 
sexual recidivism.  
Should future studies establish 

on the rates of sexual offending, policy makers and legislative leaders should investigate other 
 
  42 options for lowering sex offense rates, such as mandated treatment of 
all 
sex offenders
, potential 
use of polygraph
 testing 
and intensive probation and parole supervision.
