 Prior studies estimate between 10,000 and 573,000 fatal bird collisions with U.S. wind turbines annually; however, these studies do not differentiate between turbines with a monopole tower and those with a lattice tower, the former of which now comprise the vast majority of all U.S. wind turbines and the latter of which are largely being de-commissioned.
 We systematically derived an estimate of bird mortality for U.S. monopole turbines by applying inclusion criteria to compiled studies, identifying correlates of mortality, and utilizing a predictive model to estimate mortality along with uncertainty.
 Despite measures taken to increase analytical rigor, the studies we used may provide a non-random representation of all data; requiring industry reports to be made publicly available would improve understanding of wind energy impacts.
 Evaluation of risks to birds is warranted prior to continuing a widespread shift to taller wind turbines.
 Regional patterns of collision risk, while not obviating the need for species-specific and local-scale assessments, may inform broad-scale decisions about wind facility siting.Previous article in issueNext article in issueKeywordsAnthropogenic mortalityCarcass sampling biasesSystematic reviewWildlife mortalityWind energyRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)View AbstractPublished by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNo articles found.Citing articlesArticle MetricsView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.
