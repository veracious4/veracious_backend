 WIC PROGRAM 
ALLOWABLE COSTS
  
 Question 1
:  Are masks and respirators 
allowable WIC expenses for staff 
and participants 
should a human pandemic occur
?  
Answer: 
 In response to the 
a human p
andemic
, WIC State agencies should
 coordinate a response 
at a higher level than the 
Program level, such as the State
 Department of Public
 Health, to focus 
on identification and containment of the outbreak.
  If it is determined that masks and respirators 
are necessary for the safety and well
-being
 of WIC Program employees and participants during 
the conduct of WIC Program
 operations, the cos
t of such items would be allowed.
  Question 2: 
 Can WIC 
Program 
funds be used to purchase the vaccine
s related to a 
human 
pandemic
?  Answer:
  WIC 
Program 
funds may 
not
 be used for purchasing vaccines or administering 
vaccines.
  In no
 instance are the costs, which are associated with the delivery of acute or primary
 health care services, such as purchasing and administering vaccines and medical
 equipment (i.e., 
oxygen units, syringes, etc.), allowable WIC expenditures. The cost of the 
vaccine itself, 
vaccine
-related equipment and the cost to administer the vaccine must be paid directly from a 
non-WIC funding sources or WIC must be reimbursed.
  Question 3: 
Can WIC 
State agencies use 
program funds
 to 
pay
 for other costs related
 to 
vaccine
 effort
s?  Answer: 
 The WIC Program can pay for 
some
 costs associated with the vaccine
 effort
s such as 
planning, assessments, referrals, education and caseload management. 
 The
 WIC Program 
cannot
 pay for the cost of the vaccine itself, vaccine
-related equi
pment and
 the cost to 
administer the shots.
  Question 4: 
 Can WIC 
State and/or local agency 
staff be used to administer vaccine
s related to a Human Pandemic
?  Answer: 
 Qualified medical professionals working in WIC local agencies may be used to
 administer 
vaccines to WIC participants if a mutually agreed upon arrangement is made
 for full 
reimbursement from non
-WIC funding sources. An appropriate level of
 reimbursement to WIC 
may be provided using a ﬁfee
-per
-shotﬂ or time studies. The ﬁfee
-per
-shotﬂ is a neg
otiated 
arrangement between WIC and a non
-WIC program. 
 The fee is
 the amount the non
-WIC State 
or local programs pay the WIC Program for each shot
 WIC staff persons administer. 
 It must also 
be a fair and reasonable amount that equitably
 reimburses the WIC Program for its full WIC 
 salary costs to administer vaccines.
  Additionally, WIC State and local agencies must ensure 
WIC services are not disrupted
 or adversely affected as a result of WIC staff administering the 
vaccines.
  Question 5:
  If a State agency is using a time study to show activities, how is the time
 spent 
on the 
Human Pandemic
 efforts and 
activities reported?
  Answer: 
 The time a WIC staff person spends to administer vaccine
s must be
 recorded as non
-WIC time. 
 The time a WIC 
staff person spends on
 other 
immunization effort
s and
 activities such 
as planning, referral, education and caseload
 management may be paid with WIC funds, other 
non-WIC funding sources or shared.
 Therefore, State or local health agencies should develop 
policies that clearly establish
 which funding source will pay for planned activities. 
Reimbursement should be provided
 using a fair and reasonable ﬁfee
-per
-shotﬂ or cognizant 
agency approved time study or
 random moment sampling methodologies currently in use.
