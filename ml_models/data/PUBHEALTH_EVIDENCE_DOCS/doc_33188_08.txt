The study appears in the February 2007 issue of Social Science and Medicine.
 Respondents in all 50 states were asked whether any firearms were kept in or around their home.
 The survey found that approximately one in three American households reported firearm ownership.
 Analyses that controlled for several measures of resource deprivation, urbanization, aggravated assault, robbery, unemployment, and alcohol consumption found that states with higher rates of household firearm ownership had significantly higher homicide victimization rates for children, and for women and men.
 In these analyses, states within the highest quartile of firearm prevalence had firearm homicide rates 114% higher than states within the lowest quartile of firearm prevalence.
 Overall homicide rates were 60% higher.
 The association between firearm prevalence and homicide was driven by gun-related homicide rates; non-gun-related homicide rates were not significantly associated with rates of firearm ownership.
 These results suggest that it is easier for potential homicide perpetrators to obtain a gun in states where guns are more prevalent.
 “Our findings suggest that in the United States, household firearms may be an important source of guns used to kill children, women and men, both on the street and in their homes,” said Miller.
 This study was supported by the Joyce Foundation.
