The tongue-in-cheek web video, inspired by a classic 1984 TV commercial by now-Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), features a job-sniffing GOP bloodhound named Ellie Mae and a down-home voiceover by Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-GA).\r\n\r\nThis is a lighthearted web video, but the underlying point is no laughing matter, Boehner said.
 At a time when Americans are looking to Washington for leadership, the trillion-dollar stimulus has been a wasteful failure.
 Americans were promised the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate from going above eight percent.
 Its now at 9.4 percent, and rising.
 Where are the jobs?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the video, job-sniffing bloodhounds follow the stimulus money trail across the nation in search of the millions of jobs the Obama Administration promised to save or create if the trillion-dollar spending bill were enacted.
 The trail takes them to AIG Headquarters in New York City, where stimulus funds were used to pay big bonuses to top executives; to Wisconsin, where stimulus funds are paying for repairs to a bridge that reportedly carries about 260 cars per day, many to a place called Rustys Backwater Saloon, according to a June 16 report in the Wall Street Journal; and to North Carolina, where stimulus funds were reportedly used by one town to hire a new worker whose job is to apply for more stimulus funds from Washington.
 \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA real stimulus would help small businesses across America get back on their feet and create jobs.
 Washington hasnt tried that yet.
 Instead weve made government bigger, wasted taxpayers money, and piled new debt on our children and grandchildren, Boehner said.
 Republicans have put forth a better solution a plan that recognizes small business, not government, is the engine of the American economy.
 We hope Washington Democrats will work with us in the months ahead to make it a reality.
