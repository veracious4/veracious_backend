 The Truth: A fake news website is behind reports that President Obama will refuse to leave office is Donald Trump is elected.
 The rumor started with a report published by satire news website Burrard Street Journal in early September 2016 under the headline, “President Obama Confirms He Will Refuse to Leave Office if Trump Is Elected.” The story reports:Barack Obama has sensationally told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that he will NOT vacate the Oval office if Donald J. Trump is elected the 45th President of the United States.The current president claims he is “fully prepared” to ignore the popular vote if it means stopping Trump, having found what he believes is a little known loophole that would allow him to remain in charge until a re-election is called.“As president, I must do what I feel is in the best interests of our nation,” he explained.
 “If the American people elected ‘the Donald’ then I will be forced to take whatever actions I deem necessary.”When asked by the CNN anchor if he would remain in charge, Obama’s response was firm.
 “I am not standing down as president if it means four years of President Trump,” he said categorically.Within weeks, the story was had been shared nearly 100,000 times on Facebook.
 Another report by Burrard Street Journal that Obama announced that he would move his family to Canada if Trump were to be elected is also false.
 That one was nearly 40,000 times on social media within a month of belng published.
 Taken out of context, many readers believed that Obama had actually made the statement about not leaving office or moving to Canada if Trump were to be elected — but that’s not so.
