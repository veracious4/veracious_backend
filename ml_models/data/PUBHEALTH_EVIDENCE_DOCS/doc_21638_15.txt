 The Environmental Protection Agency has recently reviewed regulatory standards for this practice.
 However, the health effects of these events have not been well studied.
 Objective:           Our goal was to identify any increase in visits to a pediatric emergency department for diarrheal illness after sewage bypass into Lake Michigan.
 Methods:           The study was conducted as a retrospective, observational time-series analysis in a tertiary care children's hospital emergency department with an annual volume of approximately 45,000 visits.
