 Analysis of the pathological features in the lung tissues of patients who have died with COVID-19 could help us to understand the disease pathogenesis and clinical outcomes.MethodsWe systematically analysed lung tissue samples from 38 patients who died from COVID-19 in two hospitals in northern Italy between Feb 29 and March 24, 2020.
 The most representative areas identified at macroscopic examination were selected, and tissue blocks (median seven, range five to nine) were taken from each lung and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for at least 48 h. Tissues were assessed with use of haematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining for inflammatory infiltrate and cellular components (including staining with antibodies against CD68, CD3, CD45, CD61, TTF1, p40, and Ki-67), and electron microscopy to identify virion localisation.FindingsAll cases showed features of the exudative and proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage, which included capillary congestion (in all cases), necrosis of pneumocytes (in all cases), hyaline membranes (in 33 cases), interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema (in 37 cases), type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia (in all cases), squamous metaplasia with atypia (in 21 cases), and platelet–fibrin thrombi (in 33 cases).
 The inflammatory infiltrate, observed in all cases, was largely composed of macrophages in the alveolar lumina (in 24 cases) and lymphocytes in the interstitium (in 31 cases).
 Electron microscopy revealed that viral particles were predominantly located in the pneumocytes.InterpretationThe predominant pattern of lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 patients is diffuse alveolar damage, as described in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses.
 Hyaline membrane formation and pneumocyte atypical hyperplasia are frequent.
 Importantly, the presence of platelet–fibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels is consistent with coagulopathy, which appears to be common in patients with COVID-19 and should be one of the main targets of therapy.FundingNone.IntroductionSince the earliest reports of cases in China in December, 2019, countries around the world have faced outbreaks of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
 Italy was the first country in Europe to document a large number of cases of COVID-19, and Lombardy in particular was severely affected, with a total of 17 713 people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 1593 admitted to intensive care units between Feb 20 and March 18, 2020.1Grasselli G Zangrillo A Zanella A et al.Baseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy region, Italy.JAMA.

 The search revealed ten reported cases.
 Lung morphological features of COVID-19 in deceased patients were described in a few isolated case reports and in small case series, including some reports in Chinese.
 Histological descriptions of lung pathology were extremely concise, without any analytical report of morphological details, and lacking any highlighting of distinctive lesions compared with other forms of interstitial pneumonia.
 Furthermore, as only quantitative and aggregate data were available, the possible clinical implications of the findings could not be determined.Added value of this studyWe histologically examined the lung tissues of 38 patients who died from COVID-19—to our knowledge the largest post-mortem series so far reported—in two main hospitals providing care to patients with progressive breathing failure in a peak epidemic area in Italy.
 We focused on the detailed analysis of histological features in these patients to elucidate any distinctive lesions associated with COVID-19.
 To our knowledge, these data represent the first relevant provisional information regarding tissue damage specifically induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), besides the previously described diffuse alveolar damage, a feature that characterises interstitial pneumonia regardless of infectious agent.Implications of all the available evidenceAlthough our observations are provisional, they were obtained in a large cohort of patients and revealed that histopathological lung damage was characterised by expected features of diffuse alveolar damage, as well as diffuse thrombotic vascular involvement.
 This latter finding could be relevant in the management and targeted treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, with the potential to modify outcomes.Methods Patient samplesWe histologically analysed lung tissue samples from 38 consecutive patients who died from COVID-19 between Feb 29 and March 24, 2020, in two referral centres for the management of the COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy: Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan (20 autopsies) and Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo (18 autopsies).
 All patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time PCR analysis of throat swab samples taken at the time of hospital admission, and all had undergone molecular tests for common respiratory viruses and bacteria by the microbiology laboratories at the respective hospitals, with negative results.The ethics committees of Luigi Sacco Hospital and Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital approved the use of personal and sensitive patient data for scientific research related to the disease in this study.
 The study followed the Italian general rules used for scientific research purposes (regulation n.72–26/03/2012).
 Autopsies and tissue processingAutopsies were done in airborne infection isolation autopsy rooms, with personnel using personal protective equipment in accordance with the Italian recommendations.10Fineschi V Aprile A Aquila I et al.Management of the corpse with suspect, probable or confirmed COVID-19 respiratory infection—Italian interim recommendations for personnel potentially exposed to material from corpses, including body fluids, in morgue structures and during autopsy practice.Pathologica.
 2020; (published online March 26.
 )DOI:10.32074/1591-951X-13-20PubMed Google Scholar A team of pathologists (LC, AS, AN, RSR, AP, PZ, AG, and MN) with extensive experience in the field of infectious diseases was involved in the autopsy procedures in both hospitals.A median of seven tissue blocks (range five to nine) were taken from each lung, selecting the most representative areas identified at macroscopic examination.
 Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for at least 48 h. Paraffin-embedded sections of 3-μm thickness were stained with haematoxylin and eosin.
 To better characterise the inflammatory infiltrate, immunohistochemical staining was done on the most representative areas of randomly selected cases, and included staining with antibodies against CD45 (clones 2B11 and PD7/26) for the identification of leucocytes, CD3 (clone 2GV6) for T lymphocytes, CD68 (clone KP-1) for monocytes, and CD61 (clone 212) for megakaryocytes.
 Tissues were also stained with antibodies against TTF1 (clone 8G7G2/1) and p40 (clone BC28) to identify squamous metaplasia of pneumocytes, and Ki-67 (MIB-1) to determine the proliferative index of epithelial cells.
 All antibodies were ready-to-use monoclonal antibodies (Ventana, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and staining was done with the BenchMark Ultra IHC/ISH System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in accordance with the standard protocols supplied by the manufacturer.
 Masson trichome staining was applied to characterise collagen and fibrin deposition, epithelial cells, and fibrosis.
 Additionally, in cases with histological suspicion for bacterial or fungal infections, periodic acid–Schiff staining and Grocott methenamine silver staining were done to confirm morphological findings.Additional samples from ten consecutive cases were assessed for the presence of viral particles with use of electron microscopy: two samples from each lobe were selected, fixed in glutaraldehyde, and examined with use of a Zeiss EM-109 transmission electron microscope (Zeiss, Cologne, Germany) and an Olympus MegaView G2 transmission electron microscopy camera with an integrated imaging platform (iTEM; Olympus, Munich, Germany) Histopathological evaluationHistological evaluation was done independently by two pathologists from each hospital, from the same team involved with the autopsy, who were masked to patient characteristics, symptoms, and diagnoses.
 Each pathologist analysed all the slides from both hospitals, and any discrepant results were jointly reviewed.
 The histological features of cellular and interstitial damage were described and graded on a semiquantitative scale on the basis of the percentage of tissue involved: absent (0%), rare ( 75%).11Franks T Chong P Chui P et al.Lung pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a study of 8 autopsy cases from Singapore.Hum Pathol.

 The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.ResultsPatients were 33 men and five women, with a mean age of 69 years (SD 12; range 32–86).
 Time spent in the intensive care unit or intermediate medical ward (subintensive care) ranged from 1 day to 23 days (mean 7 days [SD 6]).
 Regarding past comorbidities, data were available for 31 patients: nine (29%) had diabetes, 18 (58%) had hypertension, four (13%) had past malignancies, 11 (35%) had cardiovascular disorders, and three (10%) had mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders.
 At the time of hospitalisation, all patients had clinical and radiological features of interstitial pneumonia.
 Of the 26 patients with available D-dimer results, all had high values (&gt;10 × the upper reference limit).
 Mean time from symptom onset to death was 16 days (SD 6; range 5–31).Upon macroscopic examination, the lungs of all patients were heavy, congested, and oedematous, with patchy involvement.
 In all cases, histological examination revealed features corresponding to the exudative and early or intermediate proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage (figure 1).
 These features were also focally associated with patterns of interstitial pneumonia (presence of inflammatory lymphomonocytic infiltrate along the slightly thickened interalveolar septa), organising pneumonia (alveolar loose plugs of fibroblastic tissue), and acute fibrinous organising pneumonia (some alveolar spaces containing granulocytes and fibrin, with the formation of balloon structures).
 Features indicative of the fibrotic phase of diffuse alveolar damage, such as mural fibrosis and microcystic honeycombing, were observed to be focal, suggesting that none of the patients had progressed to the fibrotic phase, possibly because of the short duration of the disease.Figure 1Haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from representative areas of lung parenchyma with diffuse alveolar damageShow full caption(A) Exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes (arrow).

 Immunohistochemistry with anti-CD61 antibodies identified an increased number of megakaryocytes in the lung capillaries in 33 (87%) cases.Ultrastructural examination (figure 2) revealed particles suggestive of viral infection in nine (90%) of the ten cases analysed.
 The particles had a mean diameter of about 82 nm and projection of about 13 nm in length.
 The particles, assumed to be virions, were mainly localised along plasmalemmal membranes and within cytoplasmic vacuoles, as described for other coronaviruses.13Stertz S Reichelt M Spiegel M et al.The intracellular sites of early replication and budding of SARS-coronavirus.Virology.
