agencies. Typically, such laws allow animal cruelty investigators to 
refer families to child welfare services and vice versa, with the expec
-tation that homes with one type of substantiated violence will also be 
at a higher risk for additional forms of victimization. As of July 2007, 
nine U.S. states had signed some type of cross-reporting legislation 
into law (California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Ohio, Louisi
-ana, Maine, Oregon, Tennessee, and West Virginia; Humane Society 

(District of Columbia, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, and New Jer
-sey; HSUS, n.d.-b).In addition, nine states (Maine, New York, Tennes
-see, Colorado, Indiana, Nevada, Connecticut, Vermont, and Illinois) 
currently have laws permitting pets to be included in protection or
-ders for domestic violence, with similar legislation pending in three 
jurisdictions (District of Columbia, California, and New Jersey; HSUS, 
n.d.-a). 
Despite these formal indications of support by policy makers and 
advocates for a link between animal- and human-directed violence, 

-tween animal cruelty and interpersonal violence remain limited. Re
-search to date has focused primarily on the link between exposure to 
animal abuse in childhood or adolescence (i.e., witnessing and/or per
-petration) and subsequent perpetration of adult violence (e.g., Arluke, 
Levin, Luke, & Ascione, 1999; Felthous & Kellert, 1986; Hensley, Talli
-chet, & Singer, 2006; Kellert & Felthous, 1985; Peterson & Farrington, 
2007; Tallichet & Hensley, 2004; Wright & Hensley, 2003). This research 
was spurred by MacDonald™s (1961) early triad theory of violence (i.e., 

cruelty in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
third edition, text revision (American Psychiatric Association, 1987) as 
a symptom of conduct disorder. In contrast, relatively few studies have directly examined the co-oc
-currence of animal abuse and violence within the family. Despite wide
-spread acceptance of the links between animal and family violence by 
advocates, policy makers, and researchers (see Becker & French, 2004), 
in which a substantial overlap between child abuse, domestic violence, 
and cruelty to animals is assumed, little evidence exists to support this 
contention (Piper & Myers, 2006). Most research has used a pairwise 
approach, examining links between animal and child abuse or between 
animal and partner abuse, with virtually no direct evidence regarding 
the overlap among all three forms of violence. The goal of the current 
investigation is to address this gap in the literature by simultaneously

-hold (Appel & Holden, 1998; Clemmons, DiLillo, Martinez, DeGue, 
& Jeffcott, 2003; Higgens & McCabe, 2000; Saunders, 2003). As noted, 
it has been suggested that these types of household violence may ex

-stance, Lacroix (1999), citing research indicating that the vast majority 
of pet owners see their animals as ﬁmembers of the family,ﬂ argued that 
companion animals who are abused within the home can rightfully be 
considered victims of family violence. Consistent with this notion, re
-searchers have begun to explore the connection between witnessing 
and/or perpetrating animal abuse, childhood maltreatment, and do
-mestic violence. The links posited by researchers and advocates tend to 
fall into two related categories: (a) the co-occurrence of animal abuse, 
child abuse, and domestic violence and (b) the perpetration of animal 
cruelty by children who witnessed animal abuse or were themselves 
abused. Current theories and evidence regarding these potential links 
are reviewed below.  IS A

1998; Carlisle-Frank, Frank, & Nielsen, 2004; Faver & Strand, 2003; 
Flynn, 2000) have assessed the co-occurrence of partner violence and 
animal cruelty by asking women seeking services from domestic vio

were small across studies, ranging from 28 (Ascione, 1998) to 41 (Fa

research, the addition of a comparison sample in this study provides 

experiences with animal cruelty among battered women. Simmons and Lehmann (2007) utilizing a much larger sample of 
women seeking services at an urban domestic violence shelter (
N = 
1,283) found that abusive males who were also cruel to animals used 
more forms of violence and employed more controlling behaviors to

-ship, with associated implications for the assessment and treatment of 
victims and perpetrators.  1040  DEGUE

perpetrated animal cruelty. Animal Cruelty by Children Exposed to Family Violence Research investigating the perpetration of animal cruelty by children 
exposed to domestic violence or child maltreatment provides additional 
insight regarding the overlap and potential etiological links between 
these forms of violence within the home. Notably, many of these inves
-tigations (in contrast to those discussed above) have employed large, 
and more representative, samples with greater potential for generaliza
-tion. For instance, Baldry (2003) found that animal-abusing youth in a 
large, nonclinical Italian sample (
N = 1,392) were more likely to have 
witnessed animal cruelty perpetrated by their peers or parents, and 
reported more overall exposure to parental violence, than their non
-abusive peers. Another study compared conduct-disordered adoles
-cent boys with and without a history of animal cruelty and found that 
the animal-abusing group was more likely to report histories of phys
-ical and/or sexual abuse and exposure to domestic violence (Duncan,

may also be that the animal cruelty exists as part of a pattern of violence 
in the home and is utilized as a means of exerting control over or intim

that male batterers may threaten or actually harm family pets as a way 
of controlling and manipulating female victims (Arkow, 1996; Ascione, 
1999; Ascione et al., 2007; Boat, 1999; Flynn, 2000; Millikin, 1999). Sim
-ilarly, child abusers may threaten, injure, or kill animals as a means of 
gaining silence or compliance from a child victim or as a threat to the 
child directly (i.e.. This is what could happen to you; Boat, 1999). Thus, 
animal abuse as a form of victim control may hinder the reporting of 
child abuse or domestic violence occurring within the household and

existing data suggest that a history of sexual abuse, exposure to do

precursors) of animal abuse perpetration by children and adolescents.

mal abuse at the hands of children in a household is also considered, 
the co-occurrence of animal- and family-directed violence may be 
quite common. 
The Present Study The combined weight of the existing research provides preliminary 

child abuse, and domestic violence, with evidence suggesting that an

-ing the rates of overlap among all three types of family violence or the 
predictive value of animal abuse as a indicator of family violence (and 
vice versa). In addition, with the exception of a few large-scale studies 
on childhood animal cruelty, much past research has been limited by 
the use of small and highly selective samples. The present study addresses these gaps in the literature by (a) in
-vestigating the co-occurrence of child maltreatment, exposure to do
-mestic violence, and animal cruelty and (b) examining the perpetra
-tion of animal cruelty by children exposed to family violence. On the 
basis of past research, we expect to identify substantial rates of over

violence in the home will predict animal cruelty perpetration by chil

CAMI using Likert-type scales, which ask respondents to indicate their 
level of agreement with a range of statements regarding their family 
and home environment while growing up. Because the CAMI is a newly 
developed measure, information regarding its psychometric properties 
is limited. However, available data indicate that 1- to 2-week test-retest

nessed animal cruelty were eight times more likely to be perpetrators. 
The strong overlap between witnessing and perpetrating animal cru
-elty suggests that social learning may play an important role in the de
-velopment of animal abuse behaviors (Haden & Scarpa, 2005). That is, 
individuals may learn these behaviors by observing their peers, fam
-ily members, or other adult abusers engaging in similar acts. When wit
-nessing interacts with a history of child maltreatment or exposure to 
domestic violence, the risk of animal cruelty may increase even further. Seemingly in contrast to the results of past research conducted in 

-ships between overall exposure to parental violence and animal cruelty. 
However, when domestic violence was limited to only the most severe 
cases, exposed individuals were more likely to have experienced animal 


-ing that severity of animal cruelty in the home is directly related to the 
severity of the domestic violence experienced. It is likely that the over
-all level of violence witnessed by this college sample was less severe 
than the one experienced by women entering a domestic violence shel
-ter, which in turn, resulted in a weaker relationship with animal cruelty 
exposure. Thus, it may be that an important link between animal abuse 
and domestic violence is present only in homes where the parental vio
-lence is particularly acute, chronic, or distressing to child witnesses. The present study is limited by the use of retrospective self-report 
data, which could result in over- or underestimates of exposure to fam
-ily and animal violence owing to intentional (e.g., social desirability) or 
unintentional (e.g., forgetting) errors. Rates of exposure to animal cru
-elty in this study were somewhat lower than those reported in other 
college samples using versions of the same measure (Flynn, 2000; Miller 
& Knutson, 1997), suggesting that underreporting was more likely in 
this sample and that the present estimates may be conservative. In ad
-dition, it was not possible to determine whether the various abuse types 
occurred concurrently or whether certain experiences preceded others. 
The inability to determine temporal sequencing precludes any conclu
-sions regarding causal relationships. Despite these limitations, this re

and animal cruelty in a large, geographically diverse sample, providing 
empirical data regarding the extent and nature of the links between an
