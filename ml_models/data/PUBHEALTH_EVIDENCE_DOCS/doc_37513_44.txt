THE 116th CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION
This ‚‚bullet™™ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor..S2021 Vol. 166 WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 2020 No. 59 Senate The Senate met at 12 noon and was called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). f PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. 
O God, our Father, we lift up our hearts in prayer because we trust in 
You. Lord, we know well the weakness 
and the insecurity of our hold upon 
this life. Comfort those who have lost loved ones during this global health crisis. 
When we wrestle with sad memories of 
mortal loss, give us the glorious hope 
of life eternal. Lord, provide our lawmakers with the confidence that Your all-sufficient 
grace and power will enable them to 
become more than conquerors during 
this time of trouble. Remind them that 
no one who trusts in You will ulti-
mately be disgraced. Mighty God, our forebears trusted in You, and You delivered them. Be not 
far from us, for You are the source of 
our hope. We pray in Your great Name. Amen. f PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. LANKFORD). The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morn-
ing business for 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f CORONAVIRUS Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Finance Com-mittee and the head of the Tax Task Force, I want to highlight a few areas 
of the bipartisan economic relief bill 
we will be voting on today. Recovery checks to give Americans needed cash to provide for their fami-
lies and get through our current health 
crisis look like this: $1,200 for individ-
uals, $2,400 for married couples, and 
$500 for each child. There is no min-
imum, no phase-in. It starts out at the 
lowest level. Anyone with a Social Security num-ber who is not a dependent of anyone 
else should be eligible for a check 
under the income caps. We also have very strong unemploy-ment compensation additions to the 
present program in this bill. We also 
have incentives to help charities be-
cause they play a very important role 
in this recovery. My colleagues across the aisle said last week that the business tax issues 
were corporate bailouts. That couldn™t 
be further from the truth, and I think 
my Democratic colleagues now agree. 
This is about helping our workers keep 
their jobs. Our economic relief package to re-cover this economy has provisions to 
help businesses so that they have the 
cash to keep the doors open and keep 
making payroll. We all worked hard, 
along with the administration, to get 
this job done. Now it is time to vote on this bill and deliver relief for the American people 
and to recover this economyŠget the 
strong economy back that we had. I yield the floor. f RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader is recognized. f CORONAVIRUS Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it has only been 65 days since the first American tested positive with the new coronavirus on our soil. In barely 2 
months, this pandemic has upended our 
Nation. As of this morning, more than 
175 million Americans have been ad-
vised to remain in their homes. More 
than half of our people are effectively 
sheltering in place. Hospitals in major cities are pushing capacity. Doctors and nurses are ex-
hausting crucial supplies. And, if it were not enough for Ameri-cans to fight to stay healthy, they are 
also fighting to keep their paychecks, 
to keep supporting their families. Com-
bating this disease has forced our coun-
try to put huge parts of our national 
life on pause and triggered layoffs at a 
breathtaking pace. This strange new reality has forced our Nation onto something like a war-
time footing. A fight has arrived at our 
shores. We did not seek it. We did not 
want it. But, now, we are going to win 
it. Ten days ago, I laid out four urgent priorities for new Senate legislation to 
help our Nation through this crisis. We 
had to get directŠdirectŠfinancial as-
sistance to the American people. We 
had to get historic aid to small busi-
nesses to keep paychecks flowing, sta-
bilize key industries to prevent mass 
layoffs, and, of course, flood more re-
sources into the frontline healthcare 
battle itself. One week ago, Senate Republicans laid down an initial proposal that tack-
led eachŠeachŠof these emergency 
missions. Our Members put forward a 
bold plan to send cash to households, 
stand up historic emergency loans for 
Main Street, stabilize key sectors, and 
put the full might of Congress behind 
our doctors, nurses, hospitals, 
healthcare providers, and the race for 
treatments and vaccines. I couldn™t be more proud of our col-leagues. Our Nation needed us to go big 
and go fast, and they did. The creative 
policies our chairmen crafted in just a 
couple of days™ time remain the central VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00001Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\A25MR6.000S25MRPT1
dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDŠSENATE
S2022 March 25, 2020 building blocks of the proposal we will pass today. But Republicans knew the Nation had no timeŠno timeŠfor conven-
tional political gamesmanship, so the 
instant we released our first draft, I 
created a series of bipartisan working 
groups. I asked Republicans and Demo-
crats to work together around the 
clockŠliterally, around the clockŠto 
make the bill even better. By Sunday, we had an updated pro-posal that was even stronger and con-
tained even more ideas, literally, from 
both sidesŠboth sides. Republicans and 
Democrats have worked together to 
dramatically strengthen and rework 
unemployment insurance during this 
crisis. We have worked together to 
make sure lower income families could 
receive the full cash assistance, and on 
and on. I will leave it to others to compare the bipartisan Sunday bill to the final 
version we will pass today and deter-
mine whether the last few changes 
really required or merited 3 days of 
delayŠ3 days of delayŠin the face of 
this worsening crisis. But that Wash-
ington drama does not matter any-
more. The Senate is going to stand to-
gether, act together, and pass this his-
toric relief package today. Struggling Americans are going to go to their mailboxes and find four-figure 
checks to help with their bills. Why? 
Because the Senate stepped up. Many American families who have poured everything into a restaurant or 
a shop or a small manufacturer are 
going to keep making payroll and keep 
their businesses alive because this Sen-
ate stepped up. Hundreds of thousands of workers in key sectors who might well have been 
laid off through no fault of their own 
will, instead, get to keep their job and 
continue their career because this Sen-
ate stepped up. And, for the healthcare heroes who leave their own sleeping children and 
drive to the hospital for an all-night 
shift, who spend hour after hour heal-
ing the sick, comforting strangers, and 
literally battling this disease, there 
will be more masks in their supply 
closet, more funding for their hos-
pitals, and, soon, more new treatments 
to administer to their patients because 
this Senate stepped up. So, today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this 
storm. Nobody thinks legislation can 
end this. We cannot outlaw the virus. No economic policy could fully end the hardship so long as the public 
health requires that we put so much of 
our Nation™s commerce on ice. This is 
not even a stimulus package. It is 
emergency reliefŠemergency relief. 
That is what this is. No, this fight is not going to be won or lost in Washington. It is the Amer-
ican people who will beat this virus. 
Americans will keep making sacrifices 
to slow down the spread. Americans 
will keep pitching in and looking after 
each other. Americans will keep find-ing creative ways to stand united, even if they have to stand 6 feet apart. We will win this fight because of peo-ple like Amy Jean Tyler, a stay-at- 
home mom in Oldham County, KY, who 
is leading a drive to sew cotton masks 
for a local children™s hospital. We will win this fight because of peo-ple like Pastor Grant Hasty in Stearns, 
KY, who is gathering volunteers to dis-
tribute more than 550 home-cooked 
meals. We will win this fight because of peo-ple like Peg Hays, who runs a distillery 
in Christian County, KY, and is tempo-
rarily converting her bourbon-making 
facilities to churn out hand sanitizer. We will win this fight because na-tional companies are switching produc-
tion lines to make medical supplies be-
cause our largest high-tech companies 
are partnering with the government to 
throw supercomputing power right into 
the race for vaccines. We will win this fight because of fam-ilies, neighbors, and church commu-
nities that cannot even worship to-
gether in person and because of small 
businesses, big businesses, public 
health Ph.D.s, and local entrepreneurs. It has been 18 years since every American was united in amazement 
and prayer as firefighters and first re-
sponders rushed into burning buildings 
on September 11, 2001. In the coming days and weeks, our Nation is going to meet new heroes. 
Many may be police, firefighters, and 
EMTs once again. Many others will be 
truckdrivers, grocery store clerks, and 
pharmacists, who literally keep our 
supply chains running; utility workers 
and delivery drivers, who leave their 
homes so everyone else can remain in 
theirs; teachers, who somehow manage 
to keep educating their students over 
the internet while looking after their 
own kids at the very same time. And, 
most of all, we are going to meet a 
whole lot of American heroes who wear 
scrubs and masks and glovesŠheroes 
who rush toward the sick and wash 
their hands until they bleed and work 
around the clock to heal our friends 
and our families. When our Nation comes through this and takes flight again on the other 
side, it will be because American he-
roes won this fight. All the Senate can 
do is to give them the resources to do 
it, and that is exactly what we are 
going to do today. f ORDER OF BUSINESS Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwith-
standing the provision of rule XXII, the 
cloture motion with respect to the mo-
tion to proceed to H.R. 748 occur at a 
time to be determined by the majority 
leader in consultation with the Demo-
cratic leader during today™s session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. f CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business is closed. f LEGISLATIVE SESSION MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019ŠMotion 
to ProceedŠResumed The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of the motion to 
proceed to H.R. 748, which the clerk 
will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 748) to amend the Internal Rev-enue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on 
high cost employer-sponsored health cov-
erage. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Illinois. CORONAVIRUS Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, America has never seen anything like this be-
fore. To think that half of the people 
who live in the United States are under 
some order to either stay home or at 
least avoid contact with others is un-
heard of. This is an enemyŠthis 
virusŠthe likes of which we have never 
faced. As strong and determined as our Na-tion is when it comes to these chal-
lenges, this is unique, and it calls for 
unique leadership. There are a lot of 
critics of the U.S. CongressŠfor good 
reasonŠbut I think what we have dem-
onstrated in the last several weeks 
since we have addressed this 
coronavirus is that there is a capacity 
for common sense, bipartisan work, 
and a timeliness that is essential. The first two measures were passed in record timeŠone for $8 billion, 
which opened the door for more med-
ical resources; the second, for $100 bil-
lion, which tried to guarantee to people 
they would never have to pay to be 
tested for coronavirus, that there 
would be adequate food supplies during 
this calamitous time, that we would 
have resources sent to the States for 
Medicaid reimbursement at new levels, 
that we would also engage people with 
family leave, as necessary, so that they 
could stay out of the workplace if they VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00002Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.002S25MRPT1

S2023 March 25, 2020 felt badly, and that we would also have an idea that we would come together as 
a nation to move unemployment insur-
ance with dispatch. That passed, again, 
in a timely way with a bipartisan vote. And, then, we came to the third chal-lengeŠa challenge the likes of which I 
have never seen in my time in Con-
gress, and I don™t imagine anyone else 
has. We decided in a span of about 7 
days to come up with a package of au-
thorizations and appropriations, which 
is larger than the annual Federal budg-
et for domestic discretionary spending 
in America. In 7 days we did what usu-
ally takes 12 months or longer, but we 
knew we had to because the need is 
that great and America was watching 
and wondering if we could rise to that 
challenge. There were some bumps in the road, and it is no surprise. An undertaking of 
that magnitude with this kind of pres-
sure to get the job done quickly and 
properly is bound to create differences 
of opinion, and it did. There were moments of anxiety on the floor of the Senate. Those who have 
followed CŒSPAN have watched many 
speeches that reflected the emotional 
levels that were reached in this Cham-
ber, but the emotions in this Chamber 
were not that different than the emo-
tions in most homes across America as 
people worry about whether this illness 
will touch their families and, if so, will 
they be able to conquer it. That emotion on the Senate floor led us to further negotiations in an effort 
to try to make a bill presented to us on 
Sunday better 3 days later. And that brings us to this moment. History will judge, as the Senator from 
Kentucky noted earlier, as to whether 
there is an improvement that has been 
made to this bill over the last 72 hours. 
I will stand up and tell you I would tes-
tify definitelyŠdefinitely. Just con-
sider the first priority. We have to 
make sure that hospitals and clinics 
and healthcare providers at every level 
in America are prepared to rise to this 
challenge. And we know this is a chal-
lenge the likes of which we have never 
seen. When the Governor of New York sug-gests that the hospitals of that great 
State expand their capacity by 50 per-
cent as quickly as possible to take the 
incoming patients from this COVIDŒ19 
virusŠand be prepared, he said, to ex-
pand it by 100 percentŠwe appreciate 
the magnitude of the challenge. On the Democratic side, our leader Senator SCHUMERhas called it a Mar-shall Plan for hospitals and healthcare. 
I don™t think that is an exaggeration. 
The bill that was presented to us on 
Sunday envisioned some $75 billion for 
that purpose, and many of us felt that 
was not adequate, as large as that 
number may be. Today, we will bring a bill to the floor that will increase that allocation 
for healthcare from the $75 billion in 
the bill just 3 days ago to $130 billion. 
Is it enough? Probably not, unless God 
spares us from the spread of this dis-ease even further in the United States. It says to those who are anxiously ex-
panding their resources, expanding the 
number of beds, bringing in retired 
medical personnelŠas the Governor 
from Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, is doingŠ 
that we hear them and are providing 
them the resources to go to work to 
fight this challenge we face at every 
corner of the United States. The second thing that we set out to do when the bill was presented on Sun-
day was to expand the opportunity for 
unemployment insurance. Some have criticized us on the floor and said: 
Don™t get into structural changes. 
Well, you couldn™t expand unemploy-
ment insurance without getting into a 
structural change because the system, 
which affects only a small percentage 
of Americans, is not adequate in most 
cases to keep a family together. If you 
lose your job and try to live on that 
unemployment check, it is hard to do. 
People lose their homes over that and 
their cars. They can™t pay their utility 
bills. So what we have done has been de-scribed as putting unemployment bene-
fits on steroids. The amount of money 
that is going to be sent to families who 
were furloughed, laid off, or unem-
ployed is dramatically bigger than it 
would have been if we hadn™t restruc-
tured unemployment compensation. At 
the same time, the President and the 
White House suggested direct cash pay-
ments. We never argued against those 
but said it is just a down payment. It is 
just a single check. We believe unem-
ployment insurance is going to be a 
guarantee of payments in months to 
come. Since Sunday, we expanded the pe-riod of additional unemployment com-
pensation from 3 months to 4 months. 
There is a big price on that, of course, 
but we think it is reasonable to give 
people peace of mind that for 4 months 
they will be able to keep their families 
together as we work our way through 
these medical challenges and, God will-
ing, see our economy back on its feet. 
I hope that happens. I hope it is even sooner, but we are prepared for 4 
months. The third thing we set out to do is one that is near and dear to me in my 
State and, I will bet, in most other 
States. We set out to compensate the 
States and some localities, counties, 
and cities that are spending substan-
tial sums of money because of the 
COVIDŒ19 threats they are facing. Let™s face it. For the most part, our Governors have been on the frontline of 
defense over the last several weeks 
when it has come to America™s 
healthcare. They have done excep-
tional things, and they have been 
called on to spend money in ways they 
never dreamed of. For example, unem-
ployment benefits, which involve State 
payments in many respects, have 
mushroomed and skyrocketedŠsome-
times 10 times the number they were 
just last year at the same time. My Governor and othersŠmayors and the leaders of county governmentŠ have come forward and asked: Are you going to help us? We are spending a lot 
of money because of this COVIDŒ19. This bill does it. It was not an easy task. We had to convince the other side that it was money well spent, and I am 
happy to report that, on a bipartisan 
basis, we reached that agreement. As it 
should, some $150 million will be going 
to these State and local governments. 
Those are things that I believe will 
move us down the path toward resolv-
ing this challenge in America and 
doing it in the proper wayŠalways 
keeping in mind that the welfare of 
workers and their families is of para-
mount concern. First is the investment on the med-ical side to stop the onslaught. Second 
is the support for families and workers 
across America. There are some items that are still being debated on the floor here. You 
heard it in the early statements by the 
majority leader, and they relate to the 
benefits to be given to businesses in 
order to keep them moving forward. We all understand the aviation indus-try is at the heart of the American 
economyŠan engine to move it, in one 
respect, and a reflection of its activity 
in another respect. That aviation in-
dustry is flat on its back. Some 80 to 90 
percent of the passenger load has dis-
appeared. Hundreds of thousands of em-
ployees in the airline industry have 
come to us and asked for help. We are 
prepared to do that, and it is part of 
the package that will come before us. The administration also asked for re-sources to be loaned to other busi-
nesses that need a helping hand. I am 
not opposed to that. Some are, but I 
am not. Yet I do believe that account-
ability and transparency are essential. Since Sunday, we have dramatically changed this package so that there will 
be transparency and accountability on 
a timely basis as decisions are made by 
this administration to allocate these 
taxpayer funds to help these compa-
nies. Some of us learned a bitter lesson 
in the past when benefits were given to 
corporations, and they were misused 
for stock buybacks and dividends and 
profiteering at a time of great national 
need. We don™t want to repeat that 
story. We want to make certain that 
the taxpayer dollars being invested in 
these corporations are really designed 
to get them back on their feet and the 
economy moving forward for the ben-
efit of everyone who lives in this coun-
try. Accountability and transparency 
are essential, and I believe this new 
agreementŠsome 3 days after the 
original one was proposedŠis an im-
provement. Credit should be given to both sides for many of the things that I just men-
tioned, because Democrats and Repub-
licans have had to agree for this to 
make the final package. Yet we believe 
what we will vote on this afternoonŠ 
and I believe we will enjoy strong bi-
partisan support on the floor of the

dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDŠSENATE
S2024 March 25, 2020 these ideas were essential, and that is why we voted as we did on the floor. 
Yet to reach this agreement and bring 
it forward, it took both sides. I salute my colleagues, starting, of course, with the Democratic leader, 
Senator SCHUMER. He has put in some hours. I can™t tell you how many times 
I stepped into his office, and Michelle, 
his assistant, told me he was in with 
Secretary Mnuchin. They spent days 
togetherŠgoing until 12 midnight and 
starting fresh early in the morningŠto 
try to reach an agreement, which I be-
lieve we finally have doneŠfinally. 
There are just a few little items left, 
but I don™t think they will hold us up. So, to Senator SCHUMERand his staff, to all of my colleagues, and to the 
ranking members who pitched in with 
their committees of jurisdiction to try 
to come up with good ideas and to sell 
them in a bipartisan agreement, that 
was an exceptional amount of work. I give special credit, too, to the staffŠto my own and to those of the 
othersŠwho have come to work in this 
dangerous moment. We are being told 
to stay home, to telework from home 
when you have to and when you can. In 
some cases, you can™t. Those who have 
shown up at the Capitol, including the 
staff who is here today on the floor, 
have come at risk, and we know thatŠ 
at risk to their own health and the 
health of their family members and 
others whom they love, as we do. So I 
thank them for this. I understand that we may be gone for several weeks, and I think that it is ap-
propriate. But for a national emer-
gency that would call us backŠand we 
will come back if that is necessaryŠI 
think we should take some time away 
from one another and away from the 
Capitol to really mind to our own 
health and the well-being of our own 
families and work back home as best 
we can, by teleconferencing and in 
other ways, to let people know what we 
have done with this new legislation. I hope that during this period of time, I can engage my colleagues in 
thinking about another issue. I and 
Senator PORTMAN, the Republican from Ohio, have introduced legislation that 
at this moment in history calls for at 
least an inquiry into remote voting or 
some different approach to voting that 
doesn™t require our physical presence 
on the floor in times of national emer-
gency. It just makes sense. The fact is, our meetings of the Sen-ate almost every single day have vio-
lated the CDC guidelines that tell us 
not to gather in a group of 10 or more. 
Yet we come to the floor because we 
have toŠbecause this is life and death 
when it comes to this legislation we 
are consideringŠand because we know 
what our jobs are. We can find a better 
way to do this in the 21st century by 
using the technology that is available 
in so many different ways in order to 
have verifiable, accurate, honest vot-
ing for those who cannot or should not 
physically be present on the floor. I have spoken to Elizabeth MacDonough, the Parliamentarian of the Senate, and her staff and want to engage in a conversation. What we 
know is that this is historic, and it 
really is a dramatic change from what 
we have done in the past, but I don™t 
think it is unrealistic. I think it re-
flects the reality of where we are today 
with the public health crisis. It may re-
flect the reality of tomorrow, which 
could be some different national emer-
gency or, God forbid, some terrorist ac-
tivity that keeps us away from this 
Capitol Building when we still have 
work to do. I thank Senator PORTMAN; Senator KLOBUCHAR, who has really been one of the leaders in this effort; and Senator 
SCHATZ, who I know is a cosponsor. We are now up to close to 20 cosponsors, on 
a bipartisan basis, to move forward in 
this change in the Senate rules. I hope 
we can have conference calls during the 
time that we are physically away from 
the Capitol and move this idea forward. 
The House is considering the same 
thing as well. Now is the time to do it. It is time to bring this great bodyŠthe U.S. Sen-
ateŠinto the 21st century when it 
comes to executing our constitutional 
responsibility without endangering 
anyone, especially Members and their 
staffs and families. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, for families, for healthcare workers, for 
small businesses, and for people who 
are waking up today all across the 
country who are asking ‚‚What is 
next?™™ I believe that today we can re-
port there is good news. The resolve and determination of this Senate, working in a bipartisan way 
and working with the White House, has 
delivered a rescue planŠa rescue plan 
for the American people and for Amer-
ican healthcare workers. We are going to pass new authorities, new resources, and new programs today 
to deal with two crises that we as a na-
tion are facing. One is the medical cri-
sis, the coronavirus, and the other is 
the economic crisis that is as a direct 
result of the medical crisis we are fac-
ing. This Senate is providing an over-whelming and massive healthcare and 
economic response package. We are 
doing both. We have to do both at the 
same time, as it is a rescue operation 
for the resources that our healthcare 
providers need and the resources that 
our economy needs. The healthcare re-
sources are going to be surging for 
communities all around the countryŠ 
every one of the 50 States is affectedŠ 
with there being over $100 billion for 
our hospitals and the heroes who are 
taking care of coronavirus patients. As the Presiding Officer knows, I am a physician and have practiced medi-
cine for a long time in Wyoming. Peo-
ple go into medicine so they can do a 
number of things, but when people go 
into medicine, what we expect of our 
healthcare providers is for them to save lives, to cure the sick, and to pre-vent disease. For all of those men and women who are working in this profession, I will 
tell you that this will be their finest 
hour. We are hearing about heroes all 
over the country, and that is going to 
continue as long as this crisis is in ef-
fect because that is what we are asking 
them to do every dayŠto save lives, 
heal the sick, and prevent disease. We see that with our public health officers who are out there, trying to 
prevent disease. We see it in commu-
nities. Day and night, we see people 
trying to heal the sick and to save 
lives in the hospitals. What they are 
asking from us are for resources, and 
that is now going to be provided in the 
bill that we are going to pass today 
that will hopefully soon be on the 
President™s desk. We are also surging dollars to indi-viduals, to families, to businesses, and 
to distressed parts of our economyŠdi-
rect money: $1,200 per individual, $500 
per childŠtake a look at thatŠand $350 
billion in bridge loans and grants to 
small and medium-sized businesses. We are providing unemployment in-surance to workersŠpeople who were 
working and were ready to go to work 
the next day but were not able to be-
cause of the medical crisis affecting us. 
So this will be to make sure that work-
ers who are not able to work right now 
are made whole. We held the line against so many of the ideological issues that the Demo-
crats and specifically the Speaker of 
the House tried to put into this legisla-
tion. We made it clear that lives were 
at stake. Those are debates for another 
day. The crisis is upon us, and the res-
cue work needs to be done. I believe time was wasted. We should have passed this last Sunday. Time was 
wasted, and it was time the American 
people didn™t have, but we are working 
on this action plan today. Pass the Senate bill today to sta-bilize American jobs and to surge 
healthcare resources to the frontlines. 
The House cannot delay. The House 
needs to get this passed today and sent 
to the President of the United States 
for his signature today. America 
should not wake up tomorrow and have 
to watch and wait and worry to see if 
the House is going to pass this bill. The 
House needs to act today. The Amer-
ican people need that reassurance 
today. EveryoneŠfamilies, young peopleŠ has committed to slowing the spread 
for the remainder of the 15-day window. 
There is about a week longer to go. 
And people are doing it all around the 
country. People are going to continue 
to ramp up the manufacturing of med-
ical equipmentŠmasks, ventilators, 
respirators, testsŠto save lives. People 
are going to keep cutting redtape and 
pressing on scientific and medical 
breakthroughs for treatments and vac-
cines. Going forwardŠand I see the minor-ity leader on the floorŠwe need to take VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00004Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.005S25MRPT1

S2025 March 25, 2020 a long, hard look at our supply chain. China has been exposed. We cannot 
allow ourselves ever again to be in any 
way dependent on China for medicines, 
for materials, or for minerals. My focus, along with what I know to be the President™s focus, is to bring 
America back stronger than ever be-
fore. We are a strong and resilient na-
tion. We will get through this. Our 
country™s healthcare infrastructure 
and our economic resolve are today 
being tested. We will defeat the virus, 
and we will be back stronger than ever. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor to thank my col-
leagues for all of their hard work on 
this legislation and to urge my col-
leagues to move forward today because 
the State of Washington desperately 
needs this help. When I think about this package that has been crafted literally since Satur-
day starting at about 10 o™clock and 
when I think about the people who had 
run to collaborateŠyes, there were 
many challenges to that collabora-
tionŠI also think about the people who 
are on the frontlines in the State of 
Washington who have paid such a 
heavy priceŠfrom the factory worker 
we just lost in Everett, WA, to the 
COVIDŒ19 disease; to the grocer at the 
Leschi Market, who was just trying to 
help deliver groceries to a needing pub-
lic; to the pathologist at the Univer-
sity of Washington who was a leader in 
this field but who also lost his life. 
Real sacrifice and real, crushing blows 
have been dealt snce December. But today we are responding with more help for our States. We are giving 
them more money for hospitals, more 
money for the frontline with protective 
gear, more money for testing, and more 
money to support them as they con-
tinue the effort to try to stop this dis-
ease. It is so important that we give State and local governments and Tribes the 
resources they need to be on the 
frontlines in fighting this disease, and 
I thank our Governor, Governor Inslee, 
for leading that charge every single 
day in trying to focus our response on 
this disease. Because we were the site of the first COVIDŒ19 case, we have been at this 
since January 21, and the sadness we 
have all felt over the Kirkland nursing 
home, where we lost so many patients, 
we hope will be a lesson for the rest of 
the Nation to pay attention to the seri-
ousness of this virus. We are also here today, thoughŠbe-sides giving that frontline support to 
States, to cities, to counties, and to 
our healthcare delivery systemŠto say 
that we want to try to lessen the eco-
nomic impacts of a shelter-in-place or 
social distancing. Our businesses, small businesses, have been hit hard. Our restaurants, 
our other businesses that have shut 
down, that don™t have the same re-sources to come to Washington, DC, and to lobby for aid and support, are 
counting on us to create a program 
that small businesses can get both grants and loans. So the $360 billion in 
this program I hope SBA will help dis-
patch with urgency to those businesses 
that have complied and have done their 
best to keep their employees while also 
shutting down their business. We also know that the unemploy-ment benefits in this package, which 
will be for an additional 4 months, will 
be a boost for people who are unem-
ployed, and the expansion of that defi-
nition to cover those who are part of a 
gig economy who may not have been 
covered in the past is important to give 
people the safety net to make it 
through this process. I wish we would have come to terms on even allowing for COBRA enhance-
ments, particularly for the aerospace 
sector. I will be filing a bill today to 
make sure that as we continue to move 
through this crisis, we think about 
those who are going to have a shiftŠ 
are laid off, as we have seen in recent 
days in Everett, WAŠso that they, too, 
could have healthcare beyond just 1 
month of a COBRA health plan. It is so 
important in fighting this disease that 
we not only take care of unemploy-
ment benefits, but we also make sure 
people in unemployment have access to 
healthcare. We can™t be in the midst of 
a pandemic and not give people afford-
able access to healthcare. I also thank my colleagues for other provisions of this package that are 
helping in giving individual taxpayers 
relief in the sense of a rebate check. 
Not only will individuals get a rebate 
check of $1,200, but families will get a 
rebate check of $2,400 that should help 
those who have been hit hardest by 
this disease in these days in which we 
are sheltering in place in the State of 
Washington. There are so many more things we need to do, and while I support the ele-
ments of supporting the aviation indus-
try in this package, I wish we would 
have gotten more requirements on the 
airline industries for the grant section 
of this bill. I personally believe that in 
the future in a healthier airline indus-
try, they should pay money back to the 
Federal Government. We certainly should be protecting the workforce during this time period, and 
that is what is most importantŠto 
make sure that an airline doesn™t take 
money from the Federal Government 
or go into bankruptcy and shortchange 
the workers and the workforce, as has 
been done in previous packages for 
them. I fully support, though, the loan guarantee program and the loan guar-
antees that are so important and so 
qualified in this package to have very 
specific requirements to them. I also want to thank my colleagues from the Banking Committee who 
worked hard on provisions in this legis-
lation to make sure there was more 
transparency in the process for who got 
access to the loans in this package. While we think of the processes we have been through before on TARP and 
the processes we have been through be-
fore on other lending, our colleagues 
here on this side of the aisle made sure 
that there were better requirements for 
oversight, inspector generals™ account-
ing of the resources, and to make sure 
that we knew exactly where these dol-
lars were being spent. I know Treasury will have its hands full, but because of Democrats, we will 
have more transparency in exactly how 
those dollars go out the door. So I want to thank Leader SCHUMER and his staff for working so diligently 
on this package. It has been a very hec-
tic couple of days. And I would say a special thanks to the Commerce Committee staff, to 
David Strickland, Melissa Porter, 
David Martin, Ronce Almond, who lit-
erally have been camped out forŠprob-
ably since last Saturday, working and 
perfecting the language in these sec-
tions related to aviation. As I said, there is more work to do, and we all know there is more work to 
do. I know I want to continue the fight 
for the aviation supply chain, to make 
sure that when we come out of this cri-
sis after an economic downturn around 
the globe, the United States is well po-
sitioned to return the supply chain 
workforce to building one of America™s 
best productsŠairplanes. One of Amer-
ica™s greatestŠactually, America™s sin-
gle largest export is airplanes. But to 
do that, we are going to have to get 
through this crisis and protect what we 
think needs to be continued healthcare 
access for those laid-off workers. So let™s get these dollars to the front-line, to our hospitals, to our States, for 
better equipment, for more supplies. 
Let™s support them in doing what they 
do best, helping to fight this disease 
and seeing this through to the other 
side of America™s challenge. I yield the floor. RECOGNITIONOFTHEMINORITYLEADER
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Washington 
for her hard and diligent work. No 
oneŠno oneŠfought harder for the

S2026 March 25, 2020 agreement on the largest rescue pack-age in American history, which was 
sealed last night a few minutes after 1 
in the morning, when Leader MCCON-NELLand I came to the floor to an-nounce we had an agreement. It was not a moment of celebration but, rather, one of necessity. Facing an 
unprecedented crisis, it was the duty of 
the Senate to produce bipartisan legis-
lation to send an immediate infusion of 
resources to our public health systems, 
State and local governments, small 
business and American workers. As I said, from the start, Democrats had two main goals: a Marshall Plan 
for public health workers and hospitals 
on the frontline and putting workers 
first, not corporations. Had we not asked for the Republican Party to recognize us by not going for-
ward on these first two votes, this bill 
would have been much worse. Our ac-
tions made it much betterŠnot every-
thing we wanted but much, much bet-
ter, and we are proud as a caucus and 
united as a caucus at the job we have 
done to improve this legislation be-
cause, after all, this legislation will be 
with us not for days and not for weeks, 
not even for months, but probably for 
years. To improve this legislation was 
worth taking an extra day or two, im-
proving it after the Republican leader 
just put it down without consulting us 
and tried to say take it or leave it. Like all compromises, this bill is far from perfect, but we believe the legis-
lation has improved sufficiently to 
warrant its quick consideration and 
passage. Because many Democrats and 
Republicans were willing to do the seri-
ous and hard work, the bill is much 
better than when we started, and start-
ing yesterday morning, we all came to-
gether to get this bill done. We worked 
in a bipartisan way, as this body should 
have worked and should work, and here 
we are. Once the language is ready, Demo-crats are ready to speed up the consid-
eration of the bill as much as possible. 
We believe the legislation has been im-
proved sufficiently to warrant its quick 
consideration and passage. I expect the 
Senate can get the job done in the new 
few hours. Now, the American people watching should know what is in this bill, which 
has undergone many revisions over the 
past 48 hours. Many of the programs and funding authorities that are being finalized as 
we speak will go to them directly, the 
American people, and could make the 
difference in the next few months be-
tween putting food on the table and 
going hungry, between surviving this 
period of unemployment and financial 
ruin. So let me briefly run through the major components of the bill. First, as 
I mentioned, a Marshall Plan for the 
American medical system is now un-
derway. This agreement will inject $150 
billion into our hospitals and health 
system, headlined by a new $100 billion 
fund to provide our health system with whatever it needs to fight back. The grants in that fund will be available to 
everyone who is fighting coronavirusŠ 
hospitals, nursing homes, community 
health centers, and all types of Med-
icaid providers and safety net pro-
viders. It includes funding for personal pro-tective equipment, testing supplies, a 
surge in our healthcare workforce, ad-
ditional Medicare funding, research 
into coronavirus treatments and more. 
The funding will literally act as a life-
line as the number of COVIDŒ19 cases 
continues to climb. So as I said, a Marshall Plan for the American medical system is now un-
derway. Second, workers first. Millions of workers, through no fault of their own, 
are losing paychecks, with no way to 
cover their daily expenses and monthly 
bills. Coming to their rescue is a pro-
gram Democrats devised to boost un-
employment insurance. We call it un-
employment insurance on steroids. The agreement increases the max-imum unemployment benefit by $600 
per week and ensures that laid-off 
workers, on average, will receive their 
full pay for 4 months. These benefits will be much easier to access and will be expanded to include 
part-time, self-employed, freelancers, 
and gig economy workers. And the new program has a secondŠ the first job of this program: Get 
money into the pockets of people who 
are losing their jobs through no fault 
of their own, and it will come quickly 
and generously. But it has a second 
purpose. It will also allow companies to 
furlough workers so that they can stay 
on as employees, so when, God willing, 
this crisis abates, they can quickly re-
sume work with their employer and 
businesses can reassemble. When this crisis is over, we don™t want every worker who is losing their 
job to scatter to the winds, and so 
many good businesses, through no fault 
of their own, will fall apart. By keeping 
them on furlough, paying them, the 
businesses can reassemble quickly. This proposal, unemployment insur-ance on steroids, will be the greatest 
expansion of unemployed benefits in 
decadesŠa social safety net wide 
enough to catch the millions of Amer-ican workers who became unemployed 
virtually overnight, woven with fiber 
strong enough to hold them through 
the worst of this crisis. As I said, we are going to pass unem-ployment insurance on steroids. Third, oversight, transparency, and accountability of all loans made to cor-
porations. The Republican bill initially 
put the focus on rescuing industry and 
did not do enough to protect the hun-
dreds upon hundreds of thousands of 
workers those industries employ. But 
as a result of our negotiations, Demo-
crats have secured crucial worker pro-
tections throughout the bill as condi-
tions to rescuing large companies, in-
cluding incentives for businesses to 
keep workers on the payroll during the 
crisis. For the nearly 2 million airline em-ployees, Democrats have also secured 
direct payroll payments to keep you on 
the job. Your collective bargaining 
rights will be protected, and airlines 
will not be allowed to spend any grant 
money on stock buybacks or CEO 
bonus pay for the life of the grant plus 
1 year. Democrats also secured tough new requirements on Federal grants and 
loans to any industry: no stock 
buybacks for the length of any loan 
provided by the Treasury, plus 1 addi-
tional year; restrictions on any in-
creases to executive compensation; a 
requirement to protect collective bar-
gaining agreements; Democrats se-
cured a prohibition on any Trump Or-
ganization business or any business 
controlled by any other government 
leaders from receiving a loan from this 
bill. We compelled the creation of Treas-ury Department Special Inspector Gen-
eral to provide oversight of Treasury 
loans and investments, an account-
ability committee to protect taxpayer 
dollars, and a congressional oversight 
Commission as well. There will be much needed trans-parency in these requirements as well. 
The Treasury Secretary must, by law, 
make public quickly the names and 
terms of loans or other assistance to 
corporate borrowers. I believe it was 
Justice Brandeis, who said: Sunlight is 
the great disinfectant. If any of these 
loans look untoward, if any of these 
loans don™t look right, or if any of 
these loans are going where they 
shouldn™t be going, the Congress and 
government will know quickly, and 
that will put pressure on the Treasury 
Secretary not to do them and certainly 
not to repeat them. Fourth, resources for State, local, and Tribal governments that are car-
rying the weight of their overburdened 
health networks on their budgets is 
there. This came down to the wire. My 
Republican friends didn™t want to do it, 
but I am glad they acceded to our wish-
es here because local governments are 
hurting. They are spending more 
money than they have ever spent and 
at the same time their tax revenues 
have declined. So we must help our 
local governments, and we will in this 
legislation. It will be distributed be-
tween both the local governments, 
county governments, and the State. In 
the end, State and local governments 
will now get $150 billion, with $8 billion 
set aside for Tribal governments. The 
relief is desperately needed because 
State revenues have dried up almost 
overnight, leaving them with unten-
able choices about how to allocate 
their healthcare and other resources. Fifth, urgent help for small busi-nesses. My dad was a small business-
man, an exterminator. He used to pace 
the floor Sunday nights at 2 a.m. be-
cause he didn™t want to go to work. I 
know small businesspeople suffer under 
normal times, let alone these difficult 
times. This bill offers $350 billion in VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00006Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.008S25MRPT1
dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDŠSENATE
S2027 March 25, 2020 loan forgiveness grants to small busi-nesses to keep their existing workforce 
and to help pay for things like rent, 
mortgages, and utilities. It provides $10 
billion in emergency grants to provide 
immediate relief for small business op-
erating costs. Of course, there are many things be-sides in this bill. Those were the five 
things we pushed for. Small business 
was much in the bill that Leader 
MCCONNELLput forward. All the rest, we as Democrats have pushed hard for 
and gotten in the bill. Now there are other things too: sup-port for American families, including 
childcare, education, senior care, hous-
ing and more. One thing of particular 
importance to my State is public tran-
sit. The MTA is drowning after such a 
steep and sudden loss of ridership. 
Democrats asked for and now have se-
cured a $25 billion life preserver to 
keep those public transit systems 
afloat as well. It is not just big cities. 
The bus systems in rural areas will de-
pend on this as well. The bottom line is this. This bipar-tisan agreement will provide more re-
sources to our public health system 
and protect American workers of all 
stripes. Now, as I have said before, this bill is far from perfect. Many flaws remain, 
some serious; but by no stretch of the 
imagination is this the bill Democrats 
would have written had we been in the 
majority. If Democrats held the pen, 
we would have designed the assistance 
to troubled industries in a completely 
different way. We would have added 
even more support for Medicaid, hos-
pitals, community health centers, 
nursing homes, and new patient protec-
tions to ensure that everyone with 
coronavirus can access and afford 
treatment. We would have increased 
food assistance. We would have in-
cluded more relief for student bor-
rowers and prohibitions on evictions 
and foreclosures on Americans for the 
duration of the crisis. We have gotten 
many of those but not all on evictions 
and foreclosures. We would have put 
workers first in every single part of the 
bill. That is what we tried to do here as much as possible, but Senate Demo-
crats are not in the majority. We knew 
this bill had to pass muster with the 
Republican administration, and a fail-
ure to reach an agreement in this time 
of deepening, serious, painful national 
crisis was simply not an option. We 
have before us an imperfect bill but a 
necessary one. Despite its flaws, it is 
far better than where we started, and it 
is time to pass it. Now, before I yield the floor. There are some people I have to recognize: 
the Republican chairs and the Demo-
cratic ranking members and their 
staffs who have worked diligently on 
this legislation; Senators Leahy, 
Cardin, Shaheen, Warren, Reed, Peters, 
and Wyden, and so many more I could 
nameŠthe whole caucus and their en-
tire staffsŠthank you. This bill is bet-ter because of your long hours and hard work. The floor staff who kept this 
Chamber open and running at all 
hours, we thank you. Secretary Mnuchin, Eric Ueland, MARKMEADOWS, and their staffs, who have spent more time in my office than 
they care to admit, thank you. To my staff, I am blessed with the greatest staff a Senator could have. 
They are so dedicated to the public 
good. They are so dedicated to this 
country. You should have seen them 
working. Gerry Petrella and Meghan 
Taira have a little baby at home. Both 
of them have important roles in my 
staff. They met here. They got mar-
ried. They are still here. They worked 
day in and day outŠbut so was every-
body elseŠso was everybody else. I 
want to thank my staff. If the Amer-
ican people saw the work you did, they 
would be so proud. So thank you from 
the bottom of my heart. Our colleagues and our staffs have committed themselves in this way be-
cause they understand the sacrifices 
being made by the American people in 
homes and hospitals across this great 
Nation: the working families who are 
at home missing paychecks, playing 
teacher and provider and caregiver all 
at once; the thousands of Americans 
who are volunteering to help under-
staffed medical facilities; the small 
business owners who are watching the 
labor of their lives evaporating in an 
instant but are still paying their work-
ers as much as they can manage; the 
nurses and doctors and healthcare 
workers who know better than anyone 
the risk of contracting this disease by 
treating infected patients, who go to 
work every day working longer shifts 
to do God™s work anyway. To them and 
to all Americans, I say this: Help is on 
the way. Big help, quick help. We are going to take up this bill and pass it to care for those who are now 
caring for us and help carry millions of 
Americans through these dark times. This is certainly not the end of our work here in Congress but rather the 
end of the beginning. The crisis con-
tinues to deepen. There will be difficult 
days ahead and the worst may be yet to 
come and we certainly may have to 
come back and do further legislation, 
but we know right now help is on the 
way, and we will not stop working 
until we see our Nation through this 
time of extraordinary challenge. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Colorado. Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, it is great to be back on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate. It is a heavy obligation 
that we have before us. On March 17, I was contacted by the Tri-County Health Department to no-
tify me that on March 11 I had been in 
a meeting with a Coloradan who later 
tested positive for COVIDŒ19, and at 
the advice of the Tri-County Health 
Department and the attending physi-
cian in the Capitol, I entered self-quar-
antine to protect my colleagues, our community, and our family. That time has now expired as of this morning. I certainly regret the fact that I missed a vote that passed 90 to 8 to 
complete phase 2 of our help to address 
COVIDŒ19. I wish I had been here be-
cause the vote would have been 91 to 8. 
Throughout that time I was in quar-
antine, I had an opportunity to visit 
with thousands and thousands of Colo-
radans through telephone townhalls in 
every congressional district to hear 
from individuals who have lost their 
jobs, to hear from business owners who 
were terrified about what happens 
next, to hear from parents who are at 
home with their kids who are out of 
school, not knowing if they go back at 
all to school; how to figure out how 
Zoom works, how to figure out how 
Skype works, how to figure out how 
technology works to teach their kids 
at home. Throughout this process I adopted a three-pronged approach to what we 
must do as a country to get through 
the crisis at hand. No. 1, we have to ad-
dress the immediate health epidemic: 
what we are doing to, as the experts 
say, ‚‚flatten the curve™™ to stop the 
spread; to provide the resources, the 
tests, the protective equipment that we 
need through our States to make sure 
that they can fight this invisible virus; 
what we can be doing to give them the 
tools and the skills they need for the 
heroic efforts of our frontline 
healthcare providersŠthe doctors, 
nurses, clerical staff, janitors, classi-
fied workersŠall of the people who 
have been so heroic to provide 
healthcare to our people. That is phase 
1, making sure we stop this epidemic 
and address the needs of the American 
people. Prong 2 of this three-pronged ap-proach is about making sure that we 
provide individuals with immediate as-
sistance: people who are terrified about 
what happens to their job, how they 
are going to make ends meet, what 
they are going to do to put food on the 
table, how they are going to pay their 
rent, how they are going to pay their 
mortgage, will they have a restaurant 
to go back to. That is prong 2 of this 
approach. Prong 3, of course, is to get our busi-nesses up and running again to make 
sure that when this health epidemic is 
overŠthis health emergency is over, 
we can make sure we have an economy 
that snaps back and runs strong. We 
will do that because we as a country 
will rise together. We will do it united. 
We will do it because we in this coun-
try know how to overcome great chal-
lenges. We are taking these measures to quarantine and self-isolate not because 
we are fearful of the virus, not because 
we are afraid of what will happen if we 
don™t, but we are doing it out of love 
for each other. We are doing it out of 
love for our neighbors, community, our 
parents, our grandparents, and our 
children. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00007Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.009S25MRPT1
dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDŠSENATE
S2028 March 25, 2020 We take the guidance of health ex-perts and public policy experts seri-
ously because we want to share that 
love with people to stop the spread so 
that we can avoid the surge that can 
overwhelm our healthcare systems be-
cause we know, under the best case sce-
nariosŠthe best case scenariosŠwe are 
looking at a situation that can utilize 
95 percent of every hospital bed in this 
country for the next year. We do this 
out of love for each other and for our 
community and to protect one another. In Colorado right now, we have roughly 1,000-plus confirmed COVIDŒ19 
patients. We have lost 12, perhaps more 
by the time I am giving this speech 
today, in Colorado. These lives, those 
who have tested positive, their loved 
ones are all in my prayers today. The Governor of Colorado obviously is issuing the emergency declarations. 
I spoke with the Governor a few min-
utes ago to talk about how we can con-
tinue to provide the resources that Col-
orado needs. Over 2 million people 
across the Denver metro area are now 
in some kind of a shelter-in-place 
order, ordered to stay at home. Our Nation is uneasy, our future is uncertain, and the level of anxiety that 
our country faces is the highest I have 
ever seen it, but we don™t need to have 
uneasiness about our future because we 
will rise together; we will come to-
gether as a nation to overcome this. We know that our future, the future of this Nation, will be prosperous 
again; that our economy will be thriv-
ing again; that our communities will 
be able to celebrate what we have over-
come because that is what we do in 
this great Nation. We rise. We rise to-
gether. We stand together. Coloradans have stepped up in every way possible. In a uniquely Colorado 
way, you have hemp businesses that 
are now producing cotton swabs for 
medical needs; you have whiskey dis-
tilleries that are producing hand sani-
tizers for hospitals and for home 
healthcare; we have protective equip-
ment that is being donated by the Den-
ver Broncos and by the marijuana in-
dustry and by so many other businesses 
across the State of Colorado which are 
stepping up in ways that make all of us 
proud. They are checking on their 
neighbors. They are checking on their 
friends. They are making sure that el-
derly people in their church whom they 
have met are OK, making sure that we 
check in with our loved ones and those 
around us. We have been able to get successful tests up and running in different places 
across Colorado, helping different orga-
nizations and different healthcare fa-
cilities find new ways to process this 
overwhelming burden. As this place has passed phase 1, which gave millions of dollars to the 
State of Colorado and so many States 
around the country, and as we passed 
phase 2, which prepared additional 
testing and nutrition programs and 
other ways to meet this challenge, we 
now turn to phase 3. Phase 3 addresses all three prongs of my approach and addresses the health 
emergency. It addresses assistance to 
individuals, and it addresses the ability 
of our economy and businesses to snap 
back when we address this health 
emergency. It needs to pass now. It 
should have passed days ago. I don™t think the American people give a hoot whether this idea was a Re-
publican idea or a Democratic idea. I 
can tell you that on my tele-townhalls 
I did and in my conversations I have 
had with American people around the 
State of Colorado, they haven™t once 
said to me ‚‚Well, we hope the Repub-
lican-only version passes™™ or ‚‚We hope 
the Democratic-only version passes.™™ 
That is not what they are saying. They 
are saying ‚‚Do your doggone job be-
cause we are scared about what hap-
pens next.™™ So pass the relief that we need to get them back on their feet, to make sure 
they know they are going to be able to 
have food on the table and to pay rent. 
I can™t imagine what somebody who for 
50 years built a small business must be 
going through every hour we delay, 
wondering if that 50-year dream is 
going to stand and survive. Shame on the people around here who said ‚‚You know what, let™s have 1 
more day of delay, 1 more hour of 
delay™™ because a Republican could get 
their way or a Democrat could get 
their way. When I was at home, not 
once did I hear anybody say ‚‚Could 
you stall a little bit more for partisan 
purposes?™™ The American people are rising above the fray. They are meeting this chal-
lenge in the spirit that I hear in every 
conversation I have. They are donating 
blood. They are sharing that love I 
talked about with their neighbors and 
their communities. They are figuring 
out new ways to be together even when 
we are supposed to stand apart. That is 
what the American people are doing. 
And we are bickering about phase 3. We will have phase 4 and phase 5, but do you know what we have done? In-
stead of patting ourselves on the back, 
do you know what we have done? We 
have managed to get back, I hope, to 
the starting line. We didn™t run 
through the tape. We haven™t finished 
the job. We have made it, I hope, to a 
place where we can now know we are 
back at the line and we can run to-
gether to fix what will be tremendous 
needs and to address the tremendous 
needs of this country and to answer the 
anxiety every single one of our con-
stituents has. That is what Congress 
should do. That is what Congress must 
do. I am glad and I will be proud to 
vote for this bill today because we have 
to get this job done, and there is more 
work to do. We have to make sure people under-stand that the recovery benefits they 
are going to be receiving will help an-
swer that anxiety, to hopefully give 
them hope, and that the new categories 
of unemployment insurance that have 
been created under this will also give them the ability to know it is going to be OK, to know that the small business 
loans that are being made available 
will help that restaurant stay in busi-
ness. You know, I talked to Eve in Aurora, and she didn™t know how she was going 
to survive because, yes, she converted 
her whole business to takeout, but she 
didn™t know how successful that would 
be. To Roberta in Pueblo, who had the same questions about how her res-
taurant was going to survive, this 
small business loan will be able to help 
people pay payroll, to bring those back 
onto payroll whom they may have let 
go because they didn™t know how they 
were going to make ends meet, to pay 
them, to pay their utilities, to pay 
their rent, to pay their mortgages, and 
to have that loan forgiven to keep this 
economy in a place where it will be vi-
brant again because that is what we do 
in this country. We don™t look back; we 
look forward. And in Colorado, we look 
up at that great Rocky Mountain hori-
zon, and we don™t look down. We look 
up, and we see the next horizon, and we 
strive for that optimistic next day. 
That is what we do in Colorado, and I 
know this country does the same. You know, I talked to a 70-year-old Coloradan in Weld County, CO, who, on 
a tele-townhallŠyou could hear it in 
her voice. She didn™t know what she 
was supposed to do because she was 
older than the experts say should be 
out and not following guidance, but, 
she said: I can™t find the disinfectants 
and the cleaners that I need. How do I 
find that? So we were able to find her 
relief. The grocery stores have stepped up, and they have provided special hours 
for people. They are delivering to peo-
ple like the woman I spoke to. They 
are providing information to their 
communities. They have clerks, they 
have cashiers, and they have people 
stocking the shelves who are on the 
frontlines of this fight as well, keeping 
our communities safe. So to all of 
them, I say thank you for the work you 
are doing each and every day. It is important to recognize in this country that we have seen great chal-
lenges. I remember my grandmother, 
who passed away this past year, talk-
ing about her experiences in the Great 
Depression. This country has been 
through the Great Depression. We have 
been through the great recession. We 
will make it through the great infec-
tion. That is what we do as a country. 
That is who we are as a people. The Senate will approve this bill today, and the House must approve it 
without delayŠno excuses; no delay; 
pass the doggone bill now. The Amer-
ican people have expected this for a 
long time. It shouldn™t have taken this 
long. Do your job. Do our job. Get this 
done. We will act out of love for our com-munities. We will act out of compas-
sion, and we will rise to the spirit that 
has made this country great. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00008Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.010S25MRPT1

S2029 March 25, 2020 I have heard so many of my col-leagues come together and talk about 
wartime footing, or they have talked 
about how we have mobilized in a way 
that maybe the people have never seen 
in their lifetimes. It has reminded me, 
though, of what Thomas Paine wrote in 
‚‚The Crisis™™ during our Revolution, 
which, actually, George Washington 
read to his troops. Here is what Thom-
as Paine said: I call not upon a few but upon all; not on this state or that state, but on every state; 
up and help us; lay your shoulders to the 
wheel; better have too much force than too 
little, when so great an object is at stake. Let it be told to the future world, that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope 
and virtue could survive, that the city and 
the country, alarmed at one common danger, 
came forth to meet and repulse it. We were taught in Sunday school that our struggles lead to persever-
ance, that perseverance leads to char-
acter, and that character gives us hope. 
We will get through this, America. We 
will start with this bill. We have a lot 
more work to do, but to my colleagues: 
Do our jobs. Get it done. No excuses. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. LOEFFLER). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, the people in this Nation are hurting. We 
know that. They are very concerned 
about their own health. They are wor-
ried that they may be carrying the 
virus and may take it home to their el-
derly parent, who could come down 
with the virus. They are worried about 
how long this social distancing and 
commuting from home and staying at 
home are going to be required in order 
to control the spread of the virus. They 
are worried about their economic cir-
cumstances, whether they are going to 
get a paycheck. I am pleased that, today, we have an agreement with our leaders to move 
forward on the third stimulus package 
to deal with this crisis of COVIDŒ19. I, first, want to express my apprecia-tion to our leadership. I have been in 
daily, almost hourly communication 
with Senator SCHUMER, and I know how hard he has worked to make sure that 
this package really deals with the med-
ical emergency we have and deals with 
the workers, to make sure they are 
protected and they are protected in 
whatever we do; that it provides the 
help for State and local governments; 
that it provides the much needed at-
tention to these particular issues; and 
that we have accountability for any of 
the monies that are going particularly 
to our largest companies in this coun-
try. So I want to express my apprecia-tion. I am very pleased that our first priorityŠour very first priorityŠis to deal with the public health challenge. 
This is including what is happening in 
my State of Maryland and what is hap-
pening in every State in our Nation. I am pleased that in our State it is ‚‚Team Maryland.™™ Our congressional 
delegation is working very closely with 
Governor Hogan and his cabinet, and 
we are working closely with our county 
executives and our mayors and our pri-
vate sector to do everything we can to 
protect the public health of the people 
of our State. We have done what we can locally to make sure that testing is available so 
we understand the dimensions of this 
problem, and the Governor has taken 
extraordinary steps in order to in-
crease our medical capacity in the 
likelihood that we are going to see a 
significantly increased number of those 
people who have the coronavirus. Yes, we need to stay at home unless there is an urgent reason for us to be 
outside. I am frequently asked by my 
friends why don™t we do as much as we 
can in the U.S. Senate remotely. I 
think we should, including voting. So 
we need to distance ourselves and mini-
mize social contact in order to prevent 
the spike of this disease, which would 
test our medical capacity to handle it. So I was pleased that the third sup-plementalŠthe agreement that has 
been reached that we will vote on, 
hopefully, todayŠdoes have a surge in 
our medical capacity, a Marshall Plan, 
to deal with our healthcare needs. I could go through a lot of the spe-cifics. I think some have already been 
gone through, but I particularly appre-
ciate the fact that we have $100 billion 
for our hospitals and healthcare facili-
ties, including clinics, in this bill. I am 
pleased that there is a 20-percent in-
crease in hospital reimbursement 
rates. I thank Senator GRASSLEYand Sen-ator WYDENfor including in that provi-sion a unique clause for the Maryland 
hospitals so that they can be qualified 
for this. As I think some of you know, 
Maryland has an all-payer rate struc-
ture, and we had to make sure that 
these provisions would apply in Mary-
land. I thank them for their attention 
to that detail. There is also money in here for our hospitals to be ready for preparedness, 
which I think is extremely important. 
And there is a separate line appropria-
tion for our community health centers 
and our federally qualified health clin-
ics. That is critically important there. 
They are being stressed as the needs 
are increasing and as the cost of treat-
ment is increasing. We need to replenish the national stockpile. We know the concerns for 
protective gear. We know that. We 
know that ventilators and respirators 
are in short supply. We have to make 
sure that we have adequate replace-
ment of what has been taken out of our 
national stockpile and available now to 
deal with the surge that is coming 
under any scenario, so that our healthcare workers have the protective gear that they need and our patients 
have the medical facilities and the res-
pirators that they need. We have also plussed up the work being done to deal with the develop-
ment of a vaccine. I am pleased that 
NIH is getting the monies they need in 
order to do the work. We know that we 
are not going to have a vaccine in time 
this year, but we want to make sure 
that we get it as soon as possible and 
that it is on a fast track. These funds 
will help us develop that vaccine for 
the future needs of controlling this 
type of a virus. But, in the meantime, we are also putting resources into therapeutic 
drugsŠdrugs that could help people 
who are sick today. Those drugs are 
not yet available, but we want to make 
sure we do everything we can to make 
them available as soon as possible. FEMA, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has been bumped 
up substantially in this bill and for 
good reason. That brings me to the 
point that is a major improvement 
that has been brought to this legisla-
tion to help our State and local govern-
ments. They are the frontlines of pro-
viding these public health needs, and 
we need to provide them the resources 
they need. So FEMA needs to be prop-
erly appropriated. We have the money 
in here to help FEMA, but we also need 
direct help for our local governments 
to deal with this problem. We see that 
our State and local public health offi-
cers are getting extra money for better 
reporting, so that we know exactly 
what the status is in each of our com-
munities. All of that is important for 
our Marshall Plan to control this dis-
ease and to get it under control. But I wanted to take this time to talk about a matter that I was working 
on for small business, and I mention 
that, recognizing that we have to get 
our economy back on track. The best 
way to get our economy back on track 
is to get this virus controlled, enable 
people to be able to get out, to work, to 
buy, and to participate in our econ-
omy. That is the best thing we can do. 
But this package also recognizes that 
unless we help businesses and workers 
today, we are not going to be prepared 
for our economy when we are able to 
rebound. So my role as the senior Democrat on the Small Business Committee, work-
ing with Senator RUBIO, the chairman of that committee, was to make sure 
that we had a robust provision to pre-
serve the growth engine and innovation 
engine of our economy, and that is 
small businesses. There is more job 
growth for small companies, and there 
is more innovation for small compa-
nies. We need to preserve the ability of 
small companies to get through this 
time. Quite frankly, they don™t have the same deep pockets that large compa-
nies have. They don™t have the same 
availability of credit that large compa-
nies have. They don™t have the same VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00009Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.011S25MRPT1

S2030 March 25, 2020 banking arrangements that large com-panies have. They don™t have the flexi-
bility that large companies have. So we 
have to provide special attention to 
small businesses, and this package does 
that in a very, very robust way. I already mentioned Senator RUBIO. I thank him for his leadership. The two 
of us were working together well before 
this week, and that is why we were 
probably further along in helping small 
businesses than the other parts of this 
package dealing with the various eco-
nomic areas. Senator SHAHEENwas a valuable Member of our team. I have worked 
with Senator SHAHEENon small busi-ness issues for a long time. She was a 
key player in putting together the 
package that we have to present to our 
colleagues here in the U.S. Senate. I also want to acknowledge Senator COLLINS. It was the four of us who were meet-ing regularly and communicating regu-
larly and who recommended this pack-
age that we will shortly be voting on as 
it relates to small business. Also, if I could, I would like to ac-knowledge members of my own staff 
who have worked literally 24/7. I have 
talked to them at various times during 
the night and day. It has been very 
stressful for all of us, but our staffs get 
no rest whatsoever. So to Sean Moore and the entire staff on the Democratic side of the Small 
Business Committee, thank you on be-
half of America™s small businesses and 
workers and on behalf of our country. And to Ron Storhaug on my staff, who has been working on a lot of these 
provisions in regard to the tax issues 
and in regard to a lot of these issues, I 
thank him for all of his work. And to Lauren Jee, who is our health person, who has not only helped us put 
together this small business package, 
but she has been available to help 
Maryland health providers and patients 
to try to get through where we are 
today. All of that is reflected in the 
bill we will be voting on later. I know on the Republican side, there has been dedicated staff who have done 
equal work to ensure that we have a 
bill that we can present today. Let me go over, if I might, some of the provisions we have in here for 
small businesses. We have three new 
programsŠthree new programsŠto 
help small businesses in our commu-
nity. They will have different titles, 
but every one of them provides grant 
help to small businesses. I want to re-
peat that. You might hear this is a 
loan. No, these are going to be funds 
that go to small businesses that do not 
have to be repaid. These are grant 
monies. Why? Because a small business 
owner can™t incur more debt today 
when they have no idea how they are 
going to be able to survive in the fu-
ture. We have to provide immediate 
helpŠimmediate help. It has to be sub-
stantial, and it has to be in a way that 
they know that they are not encum-
bering their future. And that is what we do. We want to get the message out that this is going to be immediate help 
to help America™s small businesses. One program provides $350 billion of relief to small companies under 500 em-
ployeesŠ$350 billion. It is triggered by 
going to your financial institution and 
getting what is known as a 7(a) loan. 
But let me caution you, it is going to 
be forgiven if you follow the rules here. You go to a bank or a financial insti-tution; you do a 7(a) loan; it is 100 per-
cent guaranteed by the Federal Gov-
ernment, so the bank has no risk factor 
here. There are no payments due for a 
year. So, even getting into this loan, 
there is no obligation for cash outlays 
on behalf of the borrower. The fees 
have been waived, so this is a cost-free 
opportunity to get the cash you need 
to keep your small business open. That 
is the purpose of this new program 
under the Small Business Administra-
tion. The amount of the loan: You take your average payroll before the 
coronavirus was hereŠyou take your 
monthly average payroll and multiply 
it by 2.5. Basically, what you are get-
ting is 2 months of payroll for your 
workers plus an extraŠit comes out to 
an extra 25 percent of your payroll be-
cause it is 2 months of that. Now, what are the eligible expenses? What can you use this for? Well, you 
can use the 2 months of payroll for 
payroll. Pay your workers. Keep them 
employed. It saves you the cost of re-
hiring if you had to furlough or lay off 
workers. You can keep them employed. 
You can use the extra funds to cover 
the expenses that you have on their 
healthcare or related expenses. You can use the extra 25 percent for rents or mortgage payments or utility 
bills. So it gives you cash to conduct 
your business for the next 2 months. It 
gives you the ability to keep afloat so 
that you are ready to rebound when the 
economy rebounds. Who is eligible? As I said, companies under 500, but we went beyond the tra-
ditional 7(a) eligibilities. For the first 
time under 7(a)s, we are also allowing 
nonprofits to be able to get into this 
program so that they will also be able 
to stay afloat because we know the im-
portant work that nonprofits do for our 
community. They are also eligible. And we gave some relaxation to the 500 rule for locationsŠfor restaurants 
or hotels that have multiple locations. This is a program that is aimed at keeping businesses open and readyŠ 
small businessesŠfor when we get 
through this coronavirus. Then this 
amount of money that you borrowed is totally forgivenŠtotally forgivenŠif 
you maintain your workforce to the 
precoronavirus level or bring back your 
workforce to the precoronavirus level 
during the stated period of time of this 
bill. So, if you keep your workforce or bring back your workforce, the govern-
ment is going to help you maintain 
your ability and make sure your work-
ers get paid and their benefits are 
maintained. It works very well with the other provisions that are in other parts of 
this bill, such as the unemployment in-
surance benefits. Yes, if you furlough 
workers, you can collect unemploy-
ment benefits at basically full salary 
for the next 4 months, so that is also 
available to small businesses. But we 
want you to also know that you can 
keep your employees employedŠthere, 
ready for the business to reboundŠas 
we hope it will shortly. So that is just one program. We have other programs available. We have a 
new program which is labeled as a 
grant, a $10 billion grant program for 
emergency cash availability for small 
businesses. There are many small businesses that have a hard time going to a bank 
and getting a commercial loan. There 
are many small businesses that need 
cash today; they can™t wait for that 
process to work its way through to get 
that check from the Small Business 
Administration through one of their fi-
nancial institutions. It is going to take 
a little bit longer for them to be able 
to get that done. So we have emergency disaster relief loans in the first supplemental. We 
made it clear that small businesses 
qualify for emergency disaster relief 
loans if they have been adversely im-
pacted by the coronavirus. These are 
direct loans coming out of the Small 
Business Administration. These are not 
loans that are from financial institu-
tions. We have included that in the first supplemental. We now allow you to 
make that application, and with that 
application, if you need to get cash im-
mediately, the SBA can write you a 
check for up to $10,000. And we want 
that done within 3 days. We want that 
money out in days, not weeks. We hear 
that all the time from small busi-
nesses: We need help now. I was pleased to work on this pro-gram. I filed legislation on it. This is a 
need that is out there today and will be 
available to small business owners. Now, we have a third program. Those are two programs where you can get 
this, basically, 2-month help from the 
Federal Government to pay your pay-
roll and related expenses. You can get 
a $10,000 immediate cash advancement 
on that through applying for a disaster 
relief loan and showing a need at this 
stage. Then, there is a third program. There are many small businesses today that 
have existing loans under the Small 
Business Administration. These are 
7(a) loans or 504 loans. The 7(a) is the 
traditional loan. The 504 are the larger 
loans. What this bill does is provide $17 bil-lion of relief so that those who have 
these existing loans do not need to 
make any payments on those loans. 
They are forgiven for the next 6 
months. I particularly want to acknowledge Senator COONS™ work on this. This is a bill that we have been working on, and VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00010Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.013S25MRPT1

S2031 March 25, 2020 it is only reasonableŠwe are asking others to relieve debt. Let us do it for 
our small businesses under the 7(a) and 
504 programs. So there are a lot of provisions here that help our small businesses. I want 
to tell you that, in addition to those 
three I just mentioned, I am pleased 
that we do have contract protection in 
this bill. Let me explain what that 
means. If you are a business and have a 
contract with the Federal Govern-
mentŠthis applies to all businesses, 
not just small businesses, but small 
businesses are particularly impacted 
by itŠbut you can™t perform that gov-
ernment contract because you can™t 
get access to the facility because it is 
shuttered as a result of the 
coronavirus, this bill allows the Fed-
eral Government to make sure you 
have adequate funds available to pay 
your workers so that those individuals 
who should have been working at the 
Federal facility will get paid during 
this period of time. We have also provided money for the Women™s Business Centers and the Mi-
nority Business Development Agencies 
that are there in our community. Why? 
Because we have got to get the mes-
sage out to small businesses about 
these new tools, how they can access 
banks to get these 7(a) loans that are 
forgivenŠthat are actually grants, how 
they can apply to the Small Business 
Administration for disaster relief loans 
and get a cash advancement and how 
they can get relief from their current 
7(a) and 504 loans. So we give money to these entre-preneur service groups so that they can 
help women businesses and minority 
businesses get access. We have also put a clear intent that we expect the financial institutions to 
make loans to all size small businesses 
in all communities so that all commu-
nities can benefit from this legislation. We have increased the size of Express loans under this. And I just want to 
compliment the work of other working 
groups, particularly on the tax provi-
sions. I was very pleased to work with 
Senator WYDEN. The two of us worked on what is known as a retention credit, 
which allows companies that have fur-
loughed workers to bring those work-
ers back and get a credit up to 50 per-
cent of that wage, up to $10,000, as a 
tax credit in order to bring back those 
workers. Well, for some small businesses, that may be a better option than what I 
have outlined before in regard to the 
212months of aid based upon payroll. You have a choice. If you can do bet-ter under the retention creditŠit is a 
new creditŠuse that credit; if not, use 
the other. Small businesses are given 
more flexibility. Thank you, Senator WYDEN, for help-ing us. I also want to acknowledge Sen-
ator WARNER, who was very instru-mental in getting that provision adopt-
ed. So you see that there are a whole range of tools in here to keep small businesses operatingŠpaying their workersŠso that they don™t have to re-
invent their employees after this crisis 
is over, so that they can keep qualified 
people employed, they get the pay-
checks, and our economy is ready to 
get back into shape. Now, there are many other provisions in this bill, including the cash pay-
ments under the IRSŠ$1,200 per tax-
payerŠthat will help in this regard. 
When you put this all together, this is 
a robust package to hold our economy 
so that it can perform at a level that it 
is ready to take off again without the 
dire consequences of people not having 
income in order to pay their bills. Through these small business provi-sions, small business owners can keep 
their businesses intact. Through unem-
ployment insurance, those who are laid 
off or furloughed can get their salaries. 
Through the IRS checks, people will 
have some cash. Through some of these 
other programs, we are providing re-
lief, like delaying the time of paying 
the employer share of the FICA taxes. You put that all together, there is a lot of help out here to keep our econ-
omy going during this crisis, with par-
ticular focus on the workers and on 
small business. The last point I should point out, the self-employed, the gig economy, are 
fully covered under the small business 
provisions. They are fully covered 
under the UI provisions. We are trying 
to make sure that we preserve our 
economy; that we preserve workers and 
their families and their abilities to pay 
their bills. I think, when you take a look at this whole package, the challenge will be to 
get the information out to our con-
stituents, to these businesses, to these 
workers, so they know what is in this 
package so that they can act now be-
cause, quite frankly, people are des-
perate, companies are desperate. When malls are closed, as they are in Maryland, and you are operating a 
small business in that mall and have 
no business at all, you don™t know how 
you are going to make your next pay-
roll, you have to make decisions today. That is why it is important that we vote on this bill today, we get it to the 
President as soon as possible, get the 
information out to the small busi-
nesses and to the workers and to all 
businesses that we are here to help 
keep them open, to keep the paychecks 
flowing, to keep our economy moving; 
that we are in this together. We are 
going to get through this period of 
time. Our economy is going to come 
back. We want you to know to take advan-tage of these tools so we can minimize 
the adverse impact of the coronavirus. With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma is recognized. HONORINGOURARMEDFORCES
 TECHNICALSERGEANTMARSHALROBERTS
 Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, this morning, Technical Sergeant Mar-
shal Roberts of Oklahoma came home. It was a dignified transfer in Tulsa, OK, early this morning. There were a 
lot of people who wanted to be there 
but, because of COVIDŒ19, could not. A 
lot of other folks were. Technical Sergeant Marshal Roberts was killed in Iraq Wednesday, March 
11, when his unit was engaged by direct 
enemy fire while they were sleeping. 
He was 17 miles north of Baghdad. He was deployed by the 219th Engi-neering Installation Squadron, the sub-
ordinate unit of the 138th, out of Tulsa, 
OK. He was in the process of building 
communications infrastructure as part 
of the fight against ISIS. The operation 
that Roberts served in, Operation In-
herent Resolve, has been a vital part of 
protecting our Nation and bringing sta-
bility to the region. Roberts enlisted in the Oklahoma Air National Guard in May of 2014. He was 
killed in action as the first Oklahoma 
Air National Guardsman who has died 
but the 20th Oklahoma National 
Guardsman who has died since Sep-
tember 11, 2001. The perpetual comment that I heard from the folks to whom I spoke about 
Tech Sergeant Roberts was that he was 
one of the good guys; he was always 
known for having a smile on his face; 
he was selfless; and he served others all 
the way to the end. The night of the attack, there was a truck launcher that fired off 30 
Katyusha rockets at their camp as 
folks were sleeping. Eighteen of those 
rockets landed inside the camp facil-
ity. As the noise happened around them, Sergeant Roberts told his fellow air-
men to get up, get going, and get their 
body armor on. As he stepped away to 
go warn other people to do the same, 
the rocket came. But he saved the lives 
of some of the people standing right 
there whom he had told to get their 
body armor on. He was posthumously promoted to technical sergeant. He was born January 29, 1992, in Tulsa, OK. Marshal™s parents, Sally 
and Randy, raised him in Owasso, OK, 
where he graduated from Owasso High 
School. He has a beautiful daughter, Paityn, who has been the love of his life. On 
November 15, 2018, Marshall was mar-
ried to Krissy Harris. She was also in 
the 138th. They met and started dating, 
both being part of the Air National 
Guard. Their deep love for God, their deep love for their country, and their obvi-
ous love for each other was a signifi-
cant part of the 138th. Everyone who 
knew them, knew what they were like 
and were glad to be called their friends. He was a brother, he was a son, he was a father, and he was a husband. 
Our State and our Nation grieves him 
today coming home. A fun story about him and Krissy, though, is that they met and started 
dating, as I mentioned, while they were 
both serving in the 138th. She had been 
in the 138th for 15 years. So she had ac-
tually been there longer. They dated VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00011Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.014S25MRPT1

S2032 March 25, 2020 for 4 years before they got married in 2018. They had been married just less 
than 2 years. They were both avid football fans, but there was a major problem. Krissy 
is a Kansas City Chiefs fan, and Mar-
shal was a Pittsburgh Steelers fan. 
That is a problemŠdefinitely. But he 
fixed that by proposing to Krissy at the 
Steelers-Chiefs game. I have to tell you that for the family, for the folks who stood there today in 
Tulsa as he came home, they found a 
way to love each other and found a way 
to serve each other. And to the very 
end, they are still sacrificing for the 
country. Because of the COVIDŒ19 that 
is happening right now, they have cho-
sen not to have a public memorial serv-
iceŠin a close time for the familyŠand 
they are delaying that time until it is 
safer for all of the family and for all of 
the community to be able to partici-
pate. Literally, their family continues 
the grief and the weightŠone more sac-
rifice for their country and for their 
community. Today, all of Oklahoma is using a hashtag to share messages with the 
familyŠa simple hashtag: ‚‚#TSGT 
Marshal Roberts™™; that is, hashtag 
Technical Sergeant Marshal Roberts, if 
you want all of the abbreviations on 
itŠto share a message of support and 
love for the family. Our Nation is grateful, and we grieve with you for the loss today. Thank you 
to him and to his family for wearing 
the cloth of our country and for doing 
everything our Nation asked of him to 
the very end. Our Nation lives in free-
dom because of folks like Marshal Rob-
erts, and we will continue to stand 
with Krissy and Paityn and with their 
family. With that, I yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. PERDUE). The Senator from Oklahoma. CORONAVIRUS Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we are in the process of passing a very 
large economic package to help sta-
bilize our economy through the middle 
of all that is happening with COVIDŒ19 
globally and in the United States. The 
heart of the package we are passing 
today is almost identical to what we 
brought Sunday night, which was a bi-
partisan proposal, which ranking mem-
bers and chairmen of all the major 
committees had worked together to get 
done. The key elements of it are still 
there. It has unemployment insurance 
for Americans, including a $600 plus-up 
to go through the process. There is sup-
port for small businesses that will pay 
the payroll. We don™t want individuals 
to end up on unemployment insurance. 
It is better if they stay connected to 
their same company. It has a unique 
new proposal that is built in to say a 
small business can go to any bank rap-
idly to get a loan there, which will con-
vert into a grant if they maintain their 
current employee numbers. That keeps 
people connected to their business and 
keeps people assured of a job at the end 
of all this when it finishes out. It has a grant program for larger businesses that is designed to say: If 
you are a very large company, you are 
not going to get a grant; you are going 
to get a loan in this process. At the 
moment you get a loan and, if you 
don™t have capital and you don™t have 
access to it right now because of all 
that is going on, you could get that. This also has a feature built in where individuals will receive a check for 
$1,200. Every adult does. That is built 
in to get immediate economic support 
to all those folks across the country. All of those features were already in the bill through Sunday night. There 
have been some tweaks that some folks 
have brought up that some of our 
Democratic colleagues wanted to en-
gage in. Many of those changes have been heard and been added, and to 
some we have said: Absolutely not, it is 
not connected to COVIDŒ19 at all. 
There are things that some of our 
Democratic colleagues wanted to make 
sure got in. Through all the negotia-
tions, some of these things were 
changed. For instance, they wanted to 
make sure that energy companies 
couldn™t get any support. So they 
fought hard to make sure there is no 
additional money for the President 
buying additional oil to put in the stra-
tegic petroleum reserve at this lowest 
price now. So it will actually cost us 
more money in the future. But it was 
their intention to say that we don™t 
want oil companies to get any support 
in this downturn. They also wanted to make sure there was great transparency because they 
didn™t trust the Trump administration. 
So they built in an inspector general 
and additional people to watch the 
Treasury through the process. They 
put in a neat little feature they de-
manded, which was that no son or 
daughter or family member or any in-
dividual that works with the Presi-
dency, Vice Presidency, or the Con-
gress could get any ofŠnot the grant 
programsŠthe loan programs. In fact, 
the language they demanded was inter-
esting: No son-in-law could get that. I 
wonder: Who could that be targeted to-
ward? A particular son-in-law that 
might be there. Literally, a lot of this fight we have had over the last 3 days is because they 
were demanding that there was no way 
the President or any of his family 
could get any kind of loan or benefit 
from this program at all. We spent 3 
daysŠ3 days of delayŠbecause they 
had some additional demands for some 
things they wanted to do, significantly 
targeted to a lot of the President and 
his family. I understand they don™t like 
the President. I get that. We want to 
do everything we can to protect the 
workers. That is why we had all of 
these programs in place already and 
why we had done a lot of bipartisan 
work to get it done. It is done now. 
Let™s get it going. Our encouragement is to have the House finish this up as quickly as pos-
sible and to get the support to the 
American people. What has been interesting, though, is in the speeches that I have heard on 
the floor today from my colleagues and 
from many individuals in releases I 
have seen, folks have mentioned their 
prayer. They have mentioned: With 
God™s help, we are going to get through 
this. They have mentioned the struggle 
we are going through as a nation and 
how we are praying for each other. It keeps reminding me of something. It is a very old psalm of ascent, Psalm 
121. When the Jews would come into 
Jerusalem for the different feasts, they 
would sing these psalms of ascent as 
they came off the eastern hills and 
would start rising up toward Jeru-
salem. The song they would sing, I 
think, is pertinent for our time right 
now. Psalm 121 reads: I lift up my eyes to the mountains. Where does my help come from? Remember that the mountains here are the capital city Jerusalem. It is the 
seat of government for them and the 
center of worship. But it is the seat of 
government for them. They would sing: I lift up my eyes to the mountains. Where does my help come from? 
My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of Heaven and Earth. He will not let your foot slip. 
He who watches over you will not slumber. 
Indeed, he who watches over Israel will nei-ther slumber nor sleep. The Lord watches over you. 
The Lord is your shade at your right hand. 
The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord will keep you from harm. 
He will watch over your life. 
The Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore. It is interesting to me that the peo-ple would come in marching into Jeru-
salem, the seat of government, singing 
the song: I lift up my eyes to the mountains. [But] where does my help come from? 
My help comes from the Lord. Of all the things that are going on in Washington, DC, right now, you will 
hear people repeating over and over: 
Our hope is not in government; our 
hope is not in how much money we can 
spend. We understand full well, when we lift up our eyes to the mountainŠto this 
hill. We understand full well where our 
help comes from, and it is not from all 
the folks in this room. Our help comes 
from the Lord, and we are grateful that 
He neither slumbers nor sleeps. With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Arkansas. Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, the deadly coronavirus that emerged from 
China late last year has now spread

dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDŠSENATE
S2033 March 25, 2020 come. In New York, Seattle, New Orle-ans, and elsewhere, preparation for the 
virus has ended. The virus has arrived 
in force. The urgent battle to suppress 
it has begun. In emergency rooms and ICUs, coura-geous doctors and nurses are already 
locked in a battle to save the lives of 
their patients. Protective gear is in 
short supply, but their regard for safe-
ty and even family come second to 
their duty. The days ahead will be a 
close-run thing in those cities, as they 
struggle to keep their hospitals open 
and functioning. But make no mistake. 
The China virus will spare none of usŠ 
from the high-rises of the big cities to 
the hills of the Ozarks. Soon, the Senate will finally pass desperately needed emergency legisla-
tion for our Nation, including a mas-
sive infusion of funds to our healthcare 
system. But this legislation isn™t about 
stimulus. It is about survival. With this legislation behind us, Americans are beginning to ask: What 
is next? Yes, the virus is testing us al-
ready, and it has already touched most 
of us by closing our churches, shut-
tering our businesses, and threatening 
the jobs and retirement savings of mil-
lions of Americans and, of course, 
threatening our lives. It is only natural 
that so many are wondering anxiously 
when and how this unprecedented crisis 
will end. And when it ends, will their 
jobs still there be? How will they put 
food on their table? How will they pay 
the bills? Americans want to know the plans so they can do their part. More fundamen-
tally, they want to know that there is 
a plan. Upended routines combined 
with worry about the future naturally 
breed frustration. We are citizens, after 
all, not passive carriers of a deadly 
pathogen. This frustration has given rise to a new and growing argument that Ameri-
cans can™t wait any longer, that we 
ought to open back up and take our 
chances with this virus. After all, we 
can™t stay inside forever. We can™t, as 
the saying goes, let the cure be worse 
than the disease. The urgency to stave 
off economic collapse is, of course, un-
derstandable. It is also tempting to 
think that we face a simple choice be-
tween shutting down to fight the virus 
and opening up to save the economy, 
but the choice is not so simple. Some thoughtful observers note that the seasonal flu and automobile acci-
dents kill more Americans annually 
than has this virus. That is true as far 
as it goes, but we are just at the begin-
ning of this pandemic. I have to add 
that the Javits Center in New York 
City has never been converted into a 
field hospital for the flu or car wrecks. Granting that, some say, perhaps we can reopen in a few days since our el-
derly are most at risk from this virus. 
Quarantine them. Keep them safe, the 
argument goes, while the rest of us get 
back to work. Yet there are 72 million 
Americans who are over the age of 60 in 
this country. Many of them raise chil-dren, live alone, or work outside the home. They can™t wall themselves off 
from the world nor should we wall 
them in. Moreover, tens of millions of younger Americans have preexisting conditions 
that put them at an elevated risk for 
this virus. Are we to quarantine all of 
them too? Even younger and healthier 
Americans are not safe from this pan-
demic. The China virus attacks the 
lungs of the young and the old alike. Of 
the cases we know, the virus appears to 
send about one in seven younger people 
to the hospital. It is true that survival 
rates for younger patients are better, 
but even their recoveries depend on 
there being a functioning healthcare 
system. If we give up on our efforts to control this virus now, our medical system will 
be overwhelmedŠhospitals will col-
lapse; care will be rationed; doctors 
will face the terrible choice of whom to 
save and whom to let perishŠand not 
just for patients of this virus but for 
every American who needs intensive 
care, whether it be from a heart attack 
or a stroke or a car wreck or anything 
else. Besides, if left unchecked, this dead-ly virus will continue to wreck our 
economy as surely as it has already. It 
was not President Trump who shut 
down businesses, after all, and it really 
wasn™t even the Governors and mayors, 
though they issued the orders. Govern-
ment-enforced closures were largely 
rearguard actions by communities that 
had already ground to a halt due to the 
virus or that would have soon come to 
a wrenching stop in the teeth of the 
pandemic. Who among us would take our kids to a restaurant tomorrow if we opened 
back up? Our economy isn™t seized up 
because of government dictates but, 
rather, because our people are under-
standably fearful of the dangerous 
virus. So an immediate reopening with-
out having the resources in place to 
fight the virus isn™t an option. Our hos-
pitals would be overwhelmed, and our 
brave doctors and nurses would suc-
cumb to the illness. Our businesses 
would keep their doors closed or would 
quickly close their doors again as 
workers and customers would stay 
away. The supposed choice between saving the economy and fighting the virus 
turns out not to be much of a choice at 
all. We can™t yet stop the strong meas-
ures that are in place because we have 
no better option in the short run, but 
neither can we continue them forever, 
for the American people can only hold 
out for so long. So we must come up 
with a better plan and fast. That plan 
starts with this big pause as we protect 
ourselves and each other. We simply 
don™t have the resources today to fight 
any other way, but it will not end with 
this approach. We must use the precious days and weeks ahead to lay the groundwork for 
a new strategy to fight the virusŠa 
strategy that will allow all of us to gradually get back to work. For that to happen, we will need to scale up our 
ability to rapidly test for the virus, as 
they have in South Korea, so that we 
have a sense of where the virus is and 
where we must keep it contained. Already, America™s public labora-tories and companies are rising to the 
challenge by processing tens of thou-
sands of tests, but our ability to test 
must grow even faster, and it is. We 
will need masks, tooŠbillions of them. We will also need local personnel who 
are trained and prepared to do wide-
spread contact tracing for those who 
test positive. We will have to develop 
procedures for the strict quarantines of 
those who test positive or for those 
who have been exposed to the virusŠ 
with zero tolerance for breaking quar-
antine and endangering our fellow citi-
zens. Once these elements are in place and the first wave of this virus has passed, 
then we will be prepared to reopen our 
cities and communities while remain-
ing vigilant about new outbreaks. 
These preparations will ensure we are 
ready to sustain our way of life until 
our scientists can create what we so 
desperately needŠtherapeutic drugs 
and, ultimately, a vaccine. A vaccine 
may take a year or more before it is 
available, but these other intermediate 
precautions must go into effect much, 
much faster. America must, indeed, reopen. When we do, these decisions must be based on 
local conditions, not an arbitrary na-
tionwide timeline. Our Governors and 
mayors understand their local condi-
tions. They can make gradual, rolling, 
calibrated decisions in a way that is re-
sponsible when the tools to effectively 
fight this virus are ready and available. What I have outlined may seem like a daunting and even impossible chal-
lenge, but our Nation has overcome far 
greater challenges before. Already, 
America is rising to take on the China 
virus. The giant of American industry 
is awakening and retooling our fac-
tories to join this fight just as we did 
during World War II. Never bet against 
America™s workers and American inge-
nuity. All across this country, Ameri-
cans are springing into action. We 
know the vital role our doctors and 
nurses will play in the coming months 
alongside our first responders, our fac-
tory workers, our farmers, our grocers, 
and on down the list. Ask yourself now how you can help. Can you keep your distance from those 
who are most at risk, realizing that the 
China virus preys on our most earnest 
desires for society and companionship? 
Can you offer your charity to a friend 
in need? Can you pick up groceries for 
your elderly neighbor? Can you keep 
your workers on payroll and benefits 
for just a little longer until our legisla-
tion kicks in? Can you postpone your 
tenant™s rent for a month? Can you 
pray for the deliverance of our Nation 
and the world? These are just a few of the things we must do as a country to make reopen-
ing possible and life bearable in the VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00013Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.018S25MRPT1

S2034 March 25, 2020 months ahead. We are all in this to-gether, so we will need to have each 
other™s best interests at heart. Many years of comfort and ease have, perhaps, conditioned us to ask only 
what we are free to do, not what we are 
called to do. Yet the old disciplines of 
peril and privation threaten to return, 
and we will need old notions of duty to 
maintain order in the face of them. The 
darkest days of this coronavirus are, in 
all likelihood, still ahead of us. Let us 
face up to them bravely. Let us ac-
knowledge the troubles ahead, and let 
us devote our whole energy to winning 
this battle quickly so that the normal 
life of our Nation can resume. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, during times of disaster, crisis, or hardship, I 
never fail to be inspired by the gen-
erosity of Americans, including the 
folks in my home State of Texas. I 
think about how we came together in 
the wake of Hurricane Harvey to lead 
search and rescue operations, clear de-
bris, and rebuild communities and 
lives. We saw strangers forming human 
chains to rescue a driver who was 
trapped in a car; restaurants offering 
free meals to first responders; and a 
Houston legend, known affectionately 
as Mattress Mack, opening his fur-
niture stores for those who needed 
shelter. One volunteer said: I have met more of my neighbors in the last 24 hours 
than I have in the last 20 years. While these heartwarming stories of Texans™ lending a hand to one another 
are a source of comfort even during the 
toughest of times, right now, when ex-
tending a physical hand is one of the 
worst things you can do because it vio-
lates social distancing rules, there are 
still plenty of neighbors who are help-
ing their neighbors. Folks in Texas, 
like around the country, are staying 
home to keep themselves and their 
neighbors safe, and we are seeing new 
and creative means of supporting one 
another. For example, a number of distilleries across the State have switched their 
productions from making vodka or 
whiskey to making hand sanitizer. 
With demand surging and hand sani-
tizer in short supply, more and more 
hospitals are struggling to keep it in 
stock, and these distilleries are step-
ping up to fill the void. Jonathan Likarish is the head dis-tiller and cofounder of the Ironroot Re-
public Distillery in Denison, TX. He 
said they received a call from the 
Texoma Medical Center and was asked 
if he could help. Of course, he said yes. 
Businesses like his aren™t alone. Beloved Texas grocery chain H-E-B has taken steps to make shopping easi-
er for seniors who are the most at risk 
if they contract the coronavirus. H-E-B 
has partnered with Favor Delivery to 
take grocery deliveryŠa service many 
Americans already utilizeŠand has 
made it more accessible to seniors. They can pick up the phone, place their orders, and have everything they need 
delivered to their front doors within a 
few hoursŠall without having to leave 
home. We have also seen other organiza-tions working to adapt to these chal-
lenging circumstances. The Boys & 
Girls Club of Greater Houston has 
partnered with the Houston Food Bank 
to open a drive-through pantry. Fami-
lies can get a whole week™s worth of 
healthy meals without ever having to 
step out of their cars. Of course, it is not just the busi-nesses and organizations that are help-
ing out. People are helping other peo-
ple. People are donating blood to al-
leviate the critical shortages that hos-
pitals are facing. All of us, if we can, 
should consider donating blood. People 
are leaving notes in neighbors™ mail-
boxes, offering to run errands and pick 
up supplies. On social media, school-
teachers who are at home are offering 
to help parents with their children™s 
math, science, or other subjects they 
may be struggling to teach their kids 
while the kids are at home and not at 
school. There are neighbors helping neigh-bors, friends helping strangers, and 
Texans helping Texans. That is one 
thing I love about this great country. 
Our communities always jump into ac-
tion to help in any way they can. They 
do what it takes to survive a crisis and 
to keep one another safe and healthy 
until we emerge on the other side. It is time for the Senate to do its part. There has been no event in my 
lifetime that has had this big of an im-
pact on the physical and economic 
health of our country. Every day, we 
learn about more new cases, rising un-
employment, and unprecedented mar-
ket volatility. We have a responsibility 
to act and to act quickly in response to 
these dueling crises. Already we were able to work and send two bills to the President™s desk 
for signature. The first sent vital sup-
port to healthcare professionals and 
first responders, who are doing every-
thing they can to treat patients and 
prepare for more cases. We also provided initial funding for development of a vaccine, clinical 
trials, and more diagnostic tests. The second bill we passed focused more on the small businesses and the 
individual workers who are impacted 
economically. It included changes in 
unemployment insurance so that those 
who find themselves out of a job can 
promptly take advantage of these bene-
fits, and it made paid sick and family 
leave available for workers impacted 
by the virus. That is what we did in 
these first two bills. Were they perfect? Well, no. The sec-ond bill, in particular, fell short in a 
number of areas. It was largely nego-
tiated by Secretary of the Treasury 
Mnuchin and Speaker PELOSI, but we decided that, in the interest of the 
greater good and the country and the 
people who were hurting during this crisis, we in the Senate would pass it expeditiously. As the saying goes, you 
can™t let the perfect be the enemy of 
the good. We acted quickly to get both bills to the President™s desk because the cir-
cumstances demanded it. Sadly, over 
the last few days, our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle have been obliv-
ious to the sense of urgency that every 
other American seems to understand. After the original, intense, bipartisan negotiations, we were finalizing a third 
relief bill, which included, by defini-
tion, ideas from both Republicans and 
Democrats. We were optimistic that we 
would be able to take up and pass the 
bill on Sunday or at least get it started 
and pass the bill on Monday, but, clear-
ly, that didn™t happen. Our Democratic colleagues blocked us from even debating the bill, not 
once but twice. The minority leader 
said the bill, which his Members had 
helped write, wasn™t good enough. He 
spent the next 3 days trying to change 
the bill to include provisions that he 
thought were more important prior-
ities during a national emergencyŠ 
things like tax credits for solar panels 
and tighter emission standards for air-
lines, proposals that have absolutely 
nothing to do with this crisis. After a few incredulous days, Amer-ica woke up to the news today that our 
Democratic colleagues are finally 
ready to stop this posturing and this 
obstruction and get this job done. After blocking this bill twice and holding up this emergency lifeline, 
here is what the minority leader claims 
as a victory: He says that Democrats 
expanded unemployment insurance to 
help laid-off workers and those who are 
self-employed. But as we all know, that 
was already part of the bill that had 
been negotiated between Democrats 
and Republicans. Then the minority leader said that Americans will get direct aid, but we 
have been talking about that for 
weeks. That was part of the bill that 
Democrats blocked twice. Let™s be clear about this. Here we are, Members of the U.S. Congress, get-
ting a paycheck, and they have the te-
merity to block, two times, emergency 
aid to people who have no income at all 
through no fault of their own? It is out-
rageous. Then the minority leader said that he secured unprecedented aid for Amer-
ica™s hospitals, but as it turns out, that 
was part of the bill Democrats blocked 
twice. It was the subject of bipartisan 
negotiations and, we thought, con-
sensus. Well, the bill that Democrats blocked twice was a bipartisan bill to begin 
with. Democrats and Republicans 
worked together and agreed to each of 
these points before the first votes were 
cast. The minority leader™s Members 
had spent countless hours negotiating 
with RepublicansŠthat is how you get 
things doneŠbut then he singlehand-
edly tries to take credit for the work 
that they have done. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00014Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.019S25MRPT1

S2035 March 25, 2020 For days Democrats needlessly blocked a bill that would have bol-
stered our fight to defeat this virus and 
protected our economy in the process. I 
am absolutely angry that they chose to 
waste so much valuable time when 
there are so many different people in 
need. But I am also relieved that they 
finally agreed to quit playing their par-
tisan games so that we could vote on 
this legislation today. This bill sends desperately needed funding to hospitals that are strug-
gling to manage an influx of patients 
and helps fight the shortage of masks 
and other personal protective equip-
mentŠone of the priorities my Gov-
ernor had mentioned to me. It provides the direct financial assist-ance that was already in the two bills 
that our Democratic colleagues 
blocked. A family of four will receive 
up to $3,400 under this legislation, 
which will go a long way in throwing 
that lifeline to them and cover their 
rent, groceries, electric bills, and other 
expenses until they can make other ar-
rangements, like apply for unemploy-
ment insurance under our beefed-up 
provisions. This legislation will also provide re-lief for small businesses that are strug-
gling to stay afloat. Many of these 
businesses have had to shut down be-
cause they have been ordered by the 
government to do so, and now they 
need some help to make sure that the 
jobs they currently provide will still be 
available when we get to the other side 
of this crisis, and particularly we need 
to make sure that the employees they 
depend on and will depend on in the fu-
ture will still be there when they re-
open their doors. With both the physical and economic health of our country in crisis, this 
bold legislation is our best path for-
ward. I appreciate the work that has 
been done by so many around the clock 
for the better part of the past week to 
get this bill finally to the floor, and I 
look forward to supporting it so that 
my constituentsŠthe 29 million people 
who call Texas homeŠwill get help as 
soon as possible. As we prepare to pass this legislation and send it to the House, I urge them 
to act quickly. But you may recall it 
was Speaker PELOSIwho flew back into town after a weeklong recess, dropped 
an 1,100-page bill, and made all these 
outrageous new demands, clearing out 
their partisan or ideological out-box or 
wish list. Well, incredibly, now that there has been an agreement here in the Senate 
with the administration, Speaker 
PELOSIhasn™t even called the House back into session. As a matter of fact, 
they gaveled in session and out of ses-
sion today, and they won™t be back in 
session until tomorrow. Speaker PELOSIhas a huge challenge. Unless she can get unanimous consent 
to pass a $2 trillion bill through the 
House, she may well have to call back 
into session the entire House of Rep-
resentatives. With restricted flights be-cause of a lack of demand and the cost cutting that airlines are going through 
with the concerns about people shel-
tering in place, maintaining social dis-
tance and good hygiene to stop the 
spread of this virus, Speaker PELOSI has created a terrible problem for her-
self. But, more importantly, she has 
created even more of a problem for the 
rest of the country because we need to 
get this passed out of the Senate today 
and out of the House and to the Presi-
dent as soon as possible. The American people are depending on us to respond responsibly in a bipar-
tisan way during an emergency like 
this, and we cannot let them down. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Tennessee. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, you know, I have to say that last night 
was an unusually late night here in 
Washington, and we were all impatient 
and our staffs were impatient. The 
press was impatient. As we talked to people across the State, what we realized was they long 
have been running out of patience, and 
I talked about that some on this floor. 
But for every factory worker and hour-
ly worker and small business owner 
and songwriter and gig workerŠthey 
have all been telling me that they are 
running out of time, and they have 
really just been very anxious about 
what was going to come out of this 
Chamber. I know that in the days and weeks ahead, as we work through getting re-
lief to communities and individuals 
and small business owners and large 
companies, there is going to be a lot of 
blame that is going to be thrown 
around. There is going to be some who 
are going to blame politicians. There 
are others who are going to blame the 
way the economy is structured. There 
are others still who are going to blame 
the healthcare system. But I will tell 
you, I think there is a necessity to 
have a discussion about why we do 
have this current crisis, and it is be-
cause of the leadership of the Chinese 
Government, the People™s Republic of 
China, that leadership in Beijing. We have gone around and around with activists and media on the point, 
and I shouldn™t have to point out that 
when I say China is to blame for the 
spread of the novel coronavirus that we 
call COVIDŒ19, we do not mean the Chi-
nese people as a whole. Yet we have 
some who do not want to say that is 
where it came from. I think we should 
stop that, and we should move forward 
with decisions based on fact and with 
decisions that are based on data. We need to begin to collect those facts and data as they pertain to this 
disease. That is how we get to the 
antivirals. That is how we get to hav-
ing a vaccine. That is how we look at 
lessons learned so that we don™t go 
through this again, so we plan to tack-
le some of the unexpected occurrences 
that will come our way. As we talk about facts, we do know that COVIDŒ19 originated in Wuhan, China. From there, it spread rapidly, and it has had devastating con-
sequences. The economy is crumbling. 
We are working desperately to shore it 
up. Innocent people have been in the 
hospital or sick. I talked to one Tennessean this morning who said: I am happy to re-
port my husband is coming back 
around. He has been suffering for the 
last many days with COVIDŒ19. We have the world™s healthcare pro-fessionals, and what are they doing? 
They are working to the point of ex-
haustion. What we have is Beijing™s reckless Communist dogma, and they are trying 
to blame everybody else. Today we are going to move forward with the rescue package. This is the 
phase 3 package. It is the fourth 
tranche of money. I am including in 
that the President™s emergency dec-
laration, which put about $50 billion 
toward fighting this. As we do this and 
as we find our way forward on address-
ing this, what we have to do is realize 
that our relationship with China is 
going to need to change and change for 
the better. There is no denying that 
the way they have conducted them-
selves has put that relationship on dan-
gerous ground. Today, I invite my colleagues to sup-port the bicameral S. Res. 553 and ac-
knowledge that Beijing intentionally 
spread misinformation to downplay the 
severity of COVIDŒ19 and baselessly de-
nied the risk of person-to-person trans-
mission of the disease. They refused to 
cooperate with international health 
authorities, including the CDC. During 
the early days of the outbreak, they 
censored doctors and journalists. We 
all remember what happened with the 
late Dr. Li when he tried to give us the 
warnings. On top of everything else, 
they maliciously ignored the health 
and safety of ethnic minorities. This is the easy part. The facts are there. All we have to do is acknowledge 
the facts that are there and use this as 
a beginning, because this resolution is, 
as I said, bicameral and bipartisan in 
the House. We have no reason to not 
push it forward and send the message 
that we realize what happened to cause 
a global pandemic. After we acknowledge Beijing™s gross malfeasance, we are going to adjust the 
way we think about China in the con-
text of the economy, our national de-
fense, technology, human rights, and 
pharmaceutical manufacturing. When you think about itŠthe fact that Beijing intentionally downplayed 
the deadly nature of COVIDŒ19Šit 
should come as no surprise. For dec-
ades, China has made it a business. It 
has been their business to search out 
our vulnerabilities, exploit those vul-
nerabilities, and then what do they try 
to do? They try to use that as leverage 
against us. It is time for us to say: No 
more. Another component I have talked about this week on the floor is our 
pharmaceutical supply chain. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00015Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.022S25MRPT1

S2036 March 25, 2020 On February 27, 2020, the FDA an-nounced the shortage of a drug used to 
treat victims of COVIDŒ19. Imagine 
that. There was a drug shortage. They 
attributed the shortage to difficulties 
obtaining the active ingredient in this 
pharmaceutical. The active ingredients 
are called APIs. They couldn™t get it 
from the site in China that manufac-
tured it because that site had been af-
fected by COVIDŒ19. So here we are. We 
need this component to go into a phar-
maceutical, and we cannot get it be-
cause the factory that produces it has 
been affected by COVIDŒ19. This is not the first time this has happened. In 2016, we saw a shortage of 
an important antibiotic when the sole 
source of its productionŠthe only 
place on the globe that produced this 
antibioticŠwas in China. That factory 
was shut down. We couldn™t get it. Our vulnerability is not limited to one drug or even just a handful of 
drugs. In 2007 and 2008, 246 people died 
after taking a contaminated blood 
thinner that came directly from a fac-
tory in China. They diedŠ246 peopleŠ 
just like that. Routine inspections 
didn™t catch the contaminant, and the 
drugs flowed right into our medicine 
cabinets. In 2010, regulators have also found se-rious problems with batches of thyroid 
medication, muscle relaxers, and anti-
biotics. This week I got an email from 
a Tennesseean, and he said: I saw what 
you said on the floor, and I want to let 
you know, I take a heart medication, 
and it was just recalled because it con-
tained a carcinogen, and it was made in 
China. Think about this. These are the phar-maceuticals we take to return our-
selves to health and wellness and to 
manage chronic conditions. Here we 
have example after example of things 
that are contaminated and are not 
what they are intended to be. These are 
basic, common medications. In 2018, the FDA recalled several blood pressure medications made in 
China that were contaminated with 
cancer-causing toxins. Now, I would 
imagine there are a few people who 
come to work every day in this build-
ing, who take a blood pressure medica-
tion. What if you had been taking one 
for a period of time, and it contained 
the cancer-causing toxins? Americans deserve better than this from their pharmaceutical supply 
chain. If we allow this to continue, we 
are going to do so at our own peril. I 
encourage my colleagues to support 
the bipartisan Securing America™s 
Medicine Cabinet, or SAM-C Act. Sen-
ator MENENDEZhas worked on this leg-islation with me, and I am grateful to 
him for his support. The Presiding Officer is working on legislation that would address some of 
these issues. Bring this pharmaceutical 
manufacturing back into the United 
States of America. We need to end Chi-
nese control over our health and 
wellness in this pharmaceutical supply 
chain. This may seem like something that is too large or too risky an under-
taking, but we have already paid dear-
ly for our reliance on Chinese drug 
manufacturers, and it is not going to 
stop, because that vulnerability is le-
veraged in the hands of madmen in Bei-
jing who seek nothing but power and 
will go to any lengths to acquire that 
power. They don™t care whom they 
hurt. That is clear with this global 
pandemic. They don™t care if it is inno-
cent people who are sick or maybe even 
lose their lives. And they defy usŠthey 
defy usŠwhen we try to stop them. It 
is time that we rise to the challenge 
and that we return the supply chain. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-TON). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I have been here a little over a year. I keep 
mentioning that often because what a 
year it has been. In that stretch, there 
has not been a period of time when I 
think there has been so much urgency 
for us as a Senate and for the other 
Chamber to do our job to deliver for 
the American people. We are in the midst of a crisis. In building a business over 37, 38 years, 
you constantly have hurdles to jump. 
You never really know the clear out-
come. You try to have a great strategy 
with good implementation and good 
tactics that will be your salvation 
through thick or thin. When it comes to the coronavirus, it is not as though we haven™t had other 
recent issues but nothing quite like 
this. It started in another country. It 
has gone across the world, and it now 
looks like that vector in our countryŠ 
we may be dealing with it on a broader 
scale. I am a guy who believes in free enter-prise. I don™t like it when government 
has to step in, but I don™t know what 
we would have done otherwise in this 
case. Until we tamp the disease down, 
until we get that curve flattened, no 
one is going to be at ease. We have in-
vested 3, 4 weeks of actual guidelines. 
We knew it was coming way before 
that. I am hopeful that we have been 
doing a lot of the right things even be-
fore we were required to do them. We 
can™t relent on that course. On the other hand, never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined 
an economy could be affected as it has. 
I get stories from my home State of In-
diana all the time, and not only from 
the places like hotels, restaurants, 
bars, and airlines. I think our senior 
Senator, who actually either went 
home or came out here, might have 
been the only person on the plane. 
That is a graphic example of how this 
is impacting commerce. The hotel owner I talked to had 2 percent occu-pancy in the week before. So, we have come together. This past weekend, we worked through it. I think 
that is the first time since I have been 
here that on a legislative matter we 
have done that. We had Democrats and 
Republicans at the grassroots level 
working to deliver what I think is a 
good package. It focuses on, No. 1, who 
needs it the mostŠworkers who have 
been displaced and small business own-
ers. It also has stuff in it for the broad-
er part of the economy. Urgency is the 
key. We are working through, right 
now, some short-term corrections, and 
I hope that doesn™t thwart the process. We should have had this across the finish line Sunday evening to where it 
could have been delivered on Monday 
morning, and we wouldn™t still have 
the Nation on high alert about what we 
are going to do here. And it can only 
come from here in this case. I am going to segue intoŠwe need to get that done today, and I am going to 
be for it. Each State, each Senator, and 
each Representative is going to have to 
deliver to the small business owners, 
the individuals who have been dis-
placed by this. I have a team back in 
Indiana that is taking on a big spec-
trum of casework. I invite you, when 
this legislation gets across the finish 
line, to make sure you reach out to our 
office. Many of our cases, regrettably, have been along the lines of helping folks 
interface with the VA. Sadly, I wish 
there were fewer of them, but we have 
had really good luck. We interfaced 
when a cruise ship had Hoosiers strand-
ed, and we were able to follow up on 
the process to make sure they came 
back. We are currently dealing with 
cases where people are stranded over-
seas. Whatever it is, come to our Sen-
ate office. We have a great team, and 
they have helped out a lot of Hoosiers 
already. I want to end on a positive note. I think this has the country down be-
cause everything you see is in the con-
text of negativity. I like the fact that, 
aspirationally, many are already talk-
ing about what we are going to do when 
we come out of it, and through prayers 
and through all the stuff Americans 
and Hoosiers have done, I think we are 
going to see that curve start to flatten. I like the approach we have taken to put the emphasis on the disease, be-
cause, until those numbers go down, no 
one is going to be at ease. So, as we 
look to the futureŠMonday was that 
first threshold, 15 daysŠwe need to re-
cess, take all the information we have 
gained and gathered, and make the 
right decisions going forward. I trust 
our Governors and our local govern-
ments across the country to do the 
same thing. We will come out ahead. We are going to flatten the curve and make sure 
that we are taking care of the most im-
portant thing first, and I think that is 
going to be here, hopefully, sooner 
rather than later. And then we also VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00016Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.023S25MRPT1

bipartisan billŠthat we took a dif-
ferent approach on, thanks to Repub-
lican leadership. We asked the leaders 
of each of the committees, both Demo-
crats and Republicans, to focus on 
their portion of the needs behind this 
COVIDŒ19 crisis. Before I get into my remarks today, though, I want to remind my col-
leagues here today that we have spon-
sored a resolution recognizing and 
thanking all the people in America who 
are stepping up and, as others have 
said, putting their own health and 
their families™ health at risk to make 
sure that their neighbors and friends 
and patients and business partners are 
taken care of. I am talking about sup-
ply chain people, healthcare workers, 
transportation workers, ag industryŠ 
all the people in the country who are 
keeping the essential needs of our pop-
ulation going. While restaurants are closed, they have takeout services, even here in 
Washington, DC. That is not an easy 
thing to do for those folks. It is a loss. 
They are losing money right now. I want to make sure that we recog-nize, in the midst of this crisis, how 
Americans are responding. Americans 
always respond to crisis in a better 
way than anybody else in the history of 
the world, in my opinion. Sometimes 
we are not always the quickest to rec-
ognize that we are in a crisis, but, 
right now, we are responding to this 
one right here before us. As a matter of fact, I believe we have two crises today. One is obviously the 
medical crisisŠthe healthcare crisis 
that we now are characterizing as the 
COVIDŒ19 virus. We know how it origi-
nated, and we know now what other 
countries that were ahead of us in the 
cycle are learning from that. But be-
cause of that, we have a connecting 
economic crisis that we are trying to 
deal with in this piece of legislation 
today. I hope we can get this done tonight. I don™t see any reason why we can™t. We 
have a deal. There are some questions here in the last hour, but I think we will get those done and hopefully get 
this vote going tonight. As we deal with these two crises, it is my suggestion that we look at how we 
address dealing with this crisis in three 
phases. One is we are in the middle of 
the first phase right now, and I would 
characterize it as mobilization, where 
we are identifying the severity of the 
disease; we are identifying who is the 
most vulnerable; we are identifying 
what we need to do to deal with it; and 
we are mobilizing behind it. We have seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests, thanks to Vice 
President PENCE. We still have short-ages of testing kits, swabs, and re-
agents, and even testing machines. But 
we have things, like in my State, 
where one of our major hospitals, 
Emory University Hospital, has their 
own testing. They can do it in a num-
ber of hours versus days, and they are 
making that available to other hos-
pitals in the State. This is all hands on 
deck. And they will probably lose money doing that, but they are willing 
to do that. We have an apparel company in Geor-gia that has now shut down their busi-
ness in apparel. They have good orders, 
profitable orders. They are putting 
those aside to make masks to try to 
help fill the need there and those short-
ages. But the mobilization phase is where we are today. Based on the experiences 
of other countries, we are identifying 
what we might expect here. We have 
hot spots in our country, just like 
other countries have had. We saw what 
happened in Wuhan and Hubei Province 
in China. I have been there. It is a very 
old populationŠolder population. They 
were late getting to the identification, 
treatment, and isolation, and we see 
the repercussions of that. But what we 
can learn from them is that they are 
ahead of us in the cycle. However they 
dealt with that in the early days, we 
see now how they have dealt with that 
crisis and what is happening with the 
numbers, and we can learn from that. I 
will talk about that in a second. The second phase, though, is transi-tion. This is one that I am not sure we 
are in it yet, but we are about to go 
into it partly because of this package; 
that is, to make sure that we protect 
the parts of the economy that we can 
so that when we do start to come out of 
this, just like every other country 
ahead of us in the cycle has done and is 
doing right now, we will have our busi-
nesses in a position to reconnect with 
the employees they have worked so 
hard to develop. Of course, the third phase is full-on recovery; that is, to do the things to 
get the economy back on its strong 
footing and to make sure we address 
the shortages that we found in our cur-
rent preparation for this. For example, 
we didn™t have a strategic stockpile of 
some of the essential medical supplies 
we needed for the identification, test-
ing, and treatment of this particular 
virus. That recovery will take some time, but at the same time, as America al-
ways responds to these sorts of things, 
I believe we can respond very quickly if 
we get the transition phase correct, 
and that is what I want to talk about 
today. As we look at the medical crisis, though, we understand now, through a 
lot of data outside of the United 
StatesŠand I will caveat this by say-
ing that each country™s experience is 
just a little bit different. I would also 
comment that there is a lot of noise in 
the data that I see around the world 
right now. The medical community is 
doing a great job of trying to aggregate 
this data to see how it applies to our 
needs here at home. I give our doctors and nurses and caregivers the highest thank-you I can 
for what they are doing here and all 
over the world, for that matter. But 
the experience in Italy might not be 
the same as it is here. The experience 
in South Korea might not be the same 
as it is here. So we have to look at 
those and be very careful that we don™t 
try to extrapolate either the severity 
or lack of severity as being applicable 
here. Before I get to the bill, what we do know, though, is that just this week, 
the World Health Organization pub-
lished an update to their numbers. 
They are characterizing this disease 
this wayŠand every country has a lit-
tle bit different infection rate and a 
little different mortality rate. I believe 
in the United States, because we 
haven™t tested as broadly as some of 
the other countries haveŠlike South 
KoreaŠwe don™t know what the denom-
inator is yet, so we really don™t know 
what the mortality rate is, or the in-
fection rate, for that matter. But just to put this into perspective, this is from the World Health Organiza-
tion: About 80 percent of the people in-
fected with this COVIDŒ19 virus will 
probably have a mildŠthat is the way 
they characterize itŠexperience with 
this disease. Fifteen percent will be se-
rious enough to go to a hospital, and 
then of that, 5 percent will be critical 
patients, typically generally toward 
the more vulnerable patientsŠthe el-
derly, people with respiratory pre-
existing diseases or who have poten-
tially immune deficiencies. As we deal with that medical crisisŠ and we poured a lot of resources toward 
that in the first two phases of help, in 
addition to what the President did with 
his $50 billion allocation earlierŠin 
this bill, almost $2 trillion of aid, as we 
see it, goes toward businesses and com-
munities and States to make sure that 
we can weather this storm. Let™s be very clear about this. This is not about companies. This is about em-
ployees. This is about the people who 
work for employers, either in their own 
business or in somebody else™s busi-
ness. This is all about employees. It is 
merely a financial bridge to get 
through this period of time, to get into 
that recovery phase that I was trying VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00017Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.025S25MRPT1

S2038 March 25, 2020 to describe here a little earlier. It is about the employer-employee relation-
ship and to make sure we keep that re-
lationship intact. In the last 3 years, we created 7.5 million new jobs. Prior to this 
coronavirus crisis, we had an economy 
that was just booming. It created 7.5 
million new jobs. We had 7.5 million 
job openings, as a matter of fact, and 
only 5 million people looking for work. 
So we had a situation where we had the 
economy moving in the right direction, 
and then this hits. We want to make 
sure we don™t lose any of those jobs, 
and for that reason, we focused on the 
employer-employee relationship. Yes, we plussed up unemployment benefits for the States so that they are 
not overwhelmed, but we made sure the 
employer had the liquidity to keep 
these people employed. In that vein, we 
did not want to have a liquidity crisis, 
which we could very well have right 
now because of shutting down these 
businesses. We didn™t want that liquid-
ity crisis to turn into an insolvency 
crisis. We can deal with a liquidity 
issue. It is very difficult to come back 
and deal with companies that have 
gone insolvent and are now in bank-
ruptcy proceedings. That is a very long 
and difficult process. It is difficult to 
come back from. We do not want to do 
that. And that was the primary pur-
pose of most of the facets of this billŠ 
some $2 trillion. I will say this about that. There are two major components to do that. One 
is a small business contingency. A lit-
tle over 50 percent of the people who 
work in America work for companies 
that have 500 employees or fewer. That 
is a new learning for me. That has 
changed dramatically. But it is the en-
gineŠthis is not new newsŠthis is the 
engine of new job growth in the last 3 
years. We know that. Well, we have $350 billion directly targeted toward those small busi-
nesses, which could then, by the way, 
go to their existing local banker and 
get this contingency, a government- 
backed loan guarantee. In addition to that, there is $454 bil-lion directed at other businesses, plus 
another $58 billion toward strategically 
important industries, like our airline 
industry and so forth. Again, most of 
this money is in the form of loan guar-
antees to provide liquidity to keep the 
employees employed with their em-
ployers. It is no more difficult than 
that. But there is one other thing that is not being discussed, and I want to 
highlight this, and that is, $454 billion 
is historic. That is a lot of money. But 
it has the abilityŠthrough the Treas-
ury, they can actually lever that up in 
terms of the way the money goes out 
to banks. It can be levered up to $3 or 
$4 trillion. So what we are talking 
about here is the potential of up to $5 
trillion of liquidity into our economy. 
This is historic, and it should be 
enough to shock the system to say: OK, 
there is going to be liquidity here. There may be some growing pains in the early days, but the liquidity is 
going to be there to weather this 
storm, to bridge this crisis. I want to look at what is next. I will talk about this transition phase and 
maybe even the recovery phase for a 
second. The first thing we have to do is we have to really learn from other coun-
tries that are ahead of us in the cycle. 
For example, it took about 6 to 8 weeks 
for China, even with their mistakes, to 
go from zero to their maximum num-
ber. We know the disease has a life 
cycle. If somebody is infected with it, 
if they survive, they come on the back 
side. So far, there are over 70,000 people 
who have had the disease in China and 
are healthy now. We know from anecdotal evidence on the ground that about 80 percent of the 
employed workers in China are begin-
ning to go back to work in almost 90 
percent of the factories. This is outside 
of Wuhan and Hubei Province. They are 
going back to work. In South Korea, the learning there is testing, testing, testing, but more than 
that, they also track contacts. There 
are 50 million people in South Korea. 
We have 330 million. It is a little dif-
ferent here. But in certain cities and 
States, they can certainly look at 
doing that. So we have to learn from countries like South Korea, Japan, Singapore, 
Hong Kong, Australia, and even China 
because they are ahead of us in this 
cycle. In the first few weeks of this cycle, we should be going from zero to what-
ever our maximum number is. But it is 
the number of active cases that is the 
most important, not the number of 
total cases. The mortality rate is yet to be deter-mined because we don™t really know 
the denominator. But I believe, if we 
can test moreŠand according to Vice 
President PENCE, the acceleration curve for that is underway right now, 
and we will have the ability to do that. Contact tracking is another, and then isolation is another one we have 
to think about, unfortunately. We have 
hot spots. With the Ebola crisis in Afri-
ca, what we learned from the medical 
community was that if they could put 
a full court press on the areas of flar-
ing, where they had the disease flare 
up, and isolate it so they didn™t have 
people traveling outside of those 
areasŠisolation by geography and de-
mography are unfortunately called for 
if we are going to do everything we 
have to do to control this disease in 
the timeframe that we should. The third thing I will highlight brief-ly is that I believe right now this 
shows that we were behind in terms of 
our preparation for a pandemic like 
thisŠthere is no question about itŠin 
the country and the world. We can 
point fingers and blame. That is not 
my purpose today. What I want to say 
about this is that in America, if we can 
bring the world™s resources of dataŠ this is the big thing. We have limited data in the United States. Other coun-
tries have a lot of data. I believe that 
if we aggregate that data and create a 
Manhattan Project-type effort to go to-
ward vaccines and treatments, we can 
absolutely be ready for flu season next 
year if, in fact, this particular COVIDŒ 
19 virus has a seasonality. We don™t 
know that yet. In conclusion, there is no question that this is a moment of challenge in 
America. I will say this: President 
Trump, for all his distractors, early on 
stepped up and was a strong leader. I 
said this several years agoŠhe re-
minded me of Winston Churchill: iras-
cible but effective in getting results. 
That is what we had early on. Right now, we need a steady hand to make sure we don™t kill the economy 
while we kill this disease. And my only 
point is that in this transition periodŠ 
and nobody has all the answers yetŠwe 
need to start asking the question of 
what we can do in this transition pe-
riod to find a balance between pro-
tecting life and protecting the econ-
omy long term so that when people get 
well, they will have a job to go back to 
and will have an economy that can 
help the world prepare for the next 
pandemic that we are talking about 
here. The American people have the best spirit, I believe, in the history of the 
world when it comes to dealing with 
this crisis. I have talked about a couple 
of examples in my State. The airlines right now are another one. I know that Delta is one of the 
primary airline carriers we have in the 
country. They are keeping some flights 
on. I know I have a reservation on a 
commercial flight later this week, and 
I asked my assistant: Are you sure I 
can get a seat on that plane? She said: Yes. There are only five people who have booked seats on that 
plane. So it shows that people are trying to do their part hereŠneighbors, people 
going to their grocery stores for their 
neighbors, taking care of picking up 
the mail, doing anything they can to 
protect the people who are at risk. In 
small communities, we know how to do that. In major cities, it is difficult, but 
it is even possible there. I will conclude with this: There is a day comingŠand it is not that far offŠ 
that we will be behind the top end of 
this curve in America. We will have 
lost some lives. That is unfortunate. 
We all regret that. But what we have 
to do now is to make sure we prepare 
ourselves for this transition phase, 
that while we are still dealing with 
people who are getting the disease, the 
disease is on the wane, and the econ-
omy needs to be brought back so that 
we can make sure that we can prepare 
this country for the next round that we 
may or may not see in the future. With that, I yield the floor.

S2039 March 25, 2020 have known for a long time, a gen-tleman who I would say is in his early- 
to mid-nineties. He wanted me to stop 
saying that what we are facing is an 
unprecedented challenge. I was taken 
aback. I mean, none of us have ever 
lived through anything like this or 
confronted a situation that is as pain-
ful or so traumatic. He challenged me 
to do something that I had actually 
done a few years ago, but as it shows, 
even a few years erodes memory about 
things that happened long in the past. 
He challenged me to say: You know, 
everybody is comparing this toŠthe 
last time we had something like this, it 
required the Nation to react like we 
did in World War II. So it caused me to 
go back and look a little bit at the 
years before that great and bloody con-
flict. It is interesting. In the years leading up to 1941, President Roosevelt had an 
effort to pack the Supreme Court. It 
was incredibly controversial and ended 
up falling apart in 1937. It ended up 
falling apart actually because members 
of his own party turned against him, 
and it actually weakened him in the 
tail end of the second deal. President Roosevelt was so upset about what members of his own party 
had done to him that in 1938, he did 
something unprecedented at the time. 
He got involved in Democratic pri-
maries and tried to defeatŠtake outŠ 
members of his own party who had op-
posed him. Not only did he lose badly 
in that effortŠI think he won only 1 of 
those seats that he went afterŠas a re-
sult of what he did, his party lost 6 
seats in the Senate and 71 seats in the 
House. Ultimately, in this very Cham-
ber, a Republican, Robert Taft, was 
able to put together a coalition with 
conservative Democrats and basically 
block President Roosevelt™s agenda 
leading in to 1940. Then, in 1940, Roosevelt did some-thing else that was unprecedented and 
highly controversial. He announced, al-
though it was legal, that he was run-
ning for a third term. He was, at that 
point, defying a long precedent that 
had been set by the Nation™s first 
President. Then, to make matters even more in-teresting, his own Vice President, who 
had turned on him on the Court issue, 
he had to kick off the ballot. In fact, he 
told them: If you nominate him as Vice 
President, I will refuse the nomination. Ultimately, he was reelected on a promise. Ultimately, he was reelected 
by a pretty big margin, but he had to 
make a promise: I will keep this coun-
try out of war. This sets the stage going into No-vember and December 1940. The Presi-
dent had spent the last 3 years battling 
his own party. He had seen his own 
agenda slowed and stifled and then had 
to kick off his own Vice President. 
After getting involved in primaries 
against his own party, he loses a large 
number of seats in the House and in 
the Senate and has a coalition form 
against him to block him. And then has to make a promiseŠwe are not going to warŠall the while under-
standing that what is happening in Eu-
rope would eventually reach us, and he 
was preparing for war. Why he made that promise was pret-ty fundamental. Going to war was not 
popular in this country. Millions of 
Americans, particularly thoseŠat the 
time, you couldn™t really travel 
abroadŠwho had no connections to Eu-
rope, looked at World War I as a Euro-
pean war and looked at the Second 
World War as just another trick to get 
America sucked back into a war that 
had to do with Europeans and not with 
them. Prominent voicesŠchief among them, Charles LindberghŠtraveled the 
country blasting the President as a 
warmonger in the strongest possible 
terms. There was actually a student 
antiwar movement. Now, not as many 
people went to college at that time as 
did in the 1960s, but it was really a pre-
cursor to that very movement. Why? 
Because these young people in college 
were the ones who were going to be 
sent to war if there was one, and they 
wanted no part of it. Then, in the blink of an eye, at 7:48 a.m., on the December 7, 1941, the Japa-
nese attacked the U.S. Naval Base at 
Pearl Harbor. They sunk four of our 
battleships. We lost almost 200 air-
planes, and 2,300 Americans perished on 
that very day. Even to the end of the 
war, it remained the third bloodiest 
day of that very bloody conflict. America was not ready for war. They had started a draft by a one-vote mar-
gin. They were able to vote it into 
place. They had begun some basic rear-
mament, but we had lost a significant 
percentage of our Pacific fleet. Frankly, to this day, there are legiti-mate questions not about whether the 
Roosevelt administration knew in ad-
vance that this was happening and al-
lowed the attack to happenŠno, those 
are conspiracy theoriesŠbut that they 
should have known. This was a massive 
intelligence failure. In fact, up to 30 
minutes before that attack, the Am-
bassador to Japan was here negotiating 
with the United States over an oil em-
bargo. America, by the way, was not a soci-ety of peace. This was a nation deeply 
divided, a segregated nation that dis-
criminated against citizens of color. 
There were very serious labor disputes 
going on throughout the country. 
Many still wore the scars of a deep and 
painful economic depression. Yet, in the blink of an eye, this Na-tion was confronted with an enemy and 
had no choice but to put aside all that 
had happened to that pointŠevery-
thing, all the problems it had with the 
President, all the problems they had 
with each other. Even those Americans 
who had been discriminated against 
were willing to do that, which is a tre-mendous testament to the contribution 
they made to the effort to win that 
conflict. In the blink of an eye, literally every aspect of American life was changed overnight. Think about it. One minute you are a student demanding that we 
stay out of war, and the next you are 
volunteering for service. One minute 
you are a housewife, you are a retiree, 
and the next minute you are back at 
work or at work for the first time in 
your life at a factory making muni-
tions or something else needed for the 
war effort. Schoolkids, children were put to work on farms because so many people 
had left farming to move and fulfill the 
industrial jobs because the men who 
would have otherwise filled those jobs 
were now wearing a uniform and dying 
by the hundreds every day and then by 
the thousands, all over the world. We rationed food. There was food ra-tioning. You could only eat so much. A 
family only got so much. Gasoline was 
rationed. I think it was 3 gallons a 
week, if I am not mistaken. Clothes 
were rationed. The government stepped in and said: You can™t build kitchen appliancesŠno 
refrigerators, no ovens, no vacuum 
cleanersŠnone of it. We need all of our 
industrial capacity to fight and win a 
war. People on the coastsŠand you still see old pictures of this to this dayŠoff 
Miami Beach, off New York, had to 
turn their lights off at night and close 
the shades of their windows because 
there were German U-boats just off our 
east coast. People were asked to make tremen-dous sacrificesŠnot for 3 months, not 
for 6 weeks, but for over 3 years and 
longer. The sacrifice that was ulti-
mately, perhaps, the greatest of all was 
that they sent their sons and fathers 
off to die in defense of this country and 
of our freedoms. I do not mean to diminish the chal-lenges that are being asked of us now. 
There aren™t 5 minutes that go by that 
I don™t get a call, a text, or an email 
from a small business that, just 2 
weeks ago, was having its best year 
ever, talking about hiring new people, 
and now they are bankrupt. They are 
done. They are finished, and they may 
never reopen again. From a young couple I talked about earlier today in the video that I made, 
2 weeks ago, they were recently mar-
ried and planning to start a family. 
Both had good careers. The next 
minute, they were both out of a job, 
not sure if the place they were working 
will ever exist again, not knowing 
where to go. One minute you are the father in a family or the mother in a family who 
has never had a day in your life where 
you were not employed by someone, 
and the next you are being told: Go to 
a website. Call this number. You need 
to go get unemployment. They don™t 
know how to do it. They have never 
done it. So I do not mean to diminish the sac-rifices that our people are already 
making. I simply mean to put it in per-
spective and also to give a little bit of 
clarity as to what will be required of us VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00019Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.027S25MRPT1

S2040 March 25, 2020 to win this war because, in the end, our enemy is not a nation-state. It doesn™t 
wear a uniform. But it has invaded our 
Nation in a way that has required us to 
do things we have not been asked to do, 
or anything close to it, since late 1941. So what are the lessons to be taken by that era in our history, by the call 
I got today saying: Stop saying this is 
unprecedented. The lesson to be taken is, No. 1, in moments like this, government action 
matters. It is important that we have a 
functioning government that can ad-
dress problems in the space in which 
government must act. That is what is 
being asked of us here today. What is being asked of us is not to pass a perfect bill or to pass legislation 
that will cure the virus or to pass a law 
that has everything we have ever want-
ed. What is being asked of us is this: 
Can you function as a government? Can 
you do the most basic things that a so-
ciety needs from its elected leaders at 
a moment of true crisis? Can you do 
that? So far, for 3 days, the answer, sadly, has been no. I hope the answer at the 
end of this day will be different. The second thing it teaches us is that you cannot confront a challenge such 
as this with just government. That war 
was not just won because of political 
leaders or our Armed Forces. It was a 
whole-of-society effort. Every day, 
Americans were being asked to do 
things they had never done before, in 
places they had never beenŠnot just to 
make sacrifices from what they 
couldn™t have but sacrifices in what 
they were asked to do affirmatively. It will require the same of us now. I want to tell you, there are people al-
ready doing that, as we speak. The ex-
amples are too long to mention, but all 
over this country there are people who 
are doing extraordinary thingsŠstep-
ping up, doing more than they have 
ever doneŠbecause they have to. They 
know they must. I have no doubt that if our govern-ment leaders do their job and are will-
ing to do their part and provide people 
transparent, clear, truthful guidelines 
about what we face and what lies ahead 
and what is expected of them, they 
may not be happy and people may not 
be excited about it, but they will do it. 
I know they will do it. They are al-
ready doing it. The third lesson is the awesome power of our country when a diverse 
population of go-gettersŠthe most cre-
ative people to have ever walked the 
EarthŠput aside their differences to 
confront a threat they face in common. Again, that is not possible, you can™t ask that of a society, you can™t ask 
people to put aside their differences, to 
put aside the trivial, to put aside the 
things they don™t agree on and to focus 
on the one thing that threatens us allŠ 
you can™t ask them to do that if you 
are not willing to do it yourself. And it 
appearsŠat least, up to this momentŠ 
that we have failed to do it. I hope 
today is a difference in that regard. We 
shall see. But it takes me back to the point I made originally: What is our job in 
this? Well, let me say that weŠwhen I say ‚‚we,™™ those of us in government at 
every levelŠare asking of our people to 
do some very difficult things. We are 
asking high school seniors, including 
one who lives in my home, to be the 
first in I don™t know how many genera-
tions that will not have a prom, will 
not have a senior trip, will not have a 
graduation. Now, I know all those 
things may seem trivial and may pale 
in comparison to World War II, but for 
a 17-year-old, these are rites of passage, 
and there are many high school seniors 
in this country who will not get that 
this year. We are going to ask small businesses and have asked them already: You need 
to close your doors. You can™t open. 
You can™t work. You can™t make 
money. You can™t allow customers to 
come in. We have asked people not to go to work. In fact, we have told them not to 
leave their homes. Over half this coun-
try is on an order: Don™t leave your 
house unless you are going to the doc-
tor, the pharmacy, the gas station, or 
the grocery store. We are asking nurses and doctors to confront a virus that can infect them 
and their families and kill them and 
their families, just like anybody elseŠ 
to do so, on double shifts, oftentimes 
without the gear and the equipment to 
protect them. We are asking truckdrivers to drive all nightŠalso vulnerable to the virus, 
also worried about all the other things 
all of us are worried aboutŠto drive all 
night because tomorrow those shelves 
need to be stocked with all the things 
that people are buying because they 
are afraid it is going to run out. How can we ask that of our society if, for 312days, we can™t even vote on a law, we can™t even walk to the front of 
this place and lift our finger up or 
down and say yes or no? We can™t even 
do thatŠspending the taxpayers™ 
money, on behalf of the taxpayers, in a 
moment of critical crisis? I don™t mean to be negative, because, frankly, I hope that today is the day 
we will get this solved, but there are 
still other people who have to weigh in 
hereŠin the House, outside commenta-
tors, people still emailing and texting: 
Can we change this? Can we change 
that? I just don™t know how we can ask people to do all these things we need to 
ask them to do and, in return, tell 
them, by the way, we are going to take our sweet time to do our part. And our 
part is the easiest one. You can just imagine this. Extrapo-late what we are facing now and take it 
back to 1941. Imagine if, back then, 
people would have been saying: Boy, 
this is a great chance. This is a good 
opportunity to get back at FDR. This 
is a great opportunity now. He is in 
war. Let™s roll back the New Deal. 
Let™s really stick it to him for what he 
did 6 years ago with our Court thing. Or there is the reverse. If he would have said: Boy, this is a good oppor-
tunity to use the war powers the Presi-
dent has to steamroll my political op-
ponents and put in place whatever I 
want and run them over. Imagine if we were saying that we need to build a lot of ships, but I am 
not going to vote to build it unless you 
are building it in my State. I don™t want to go any deeper into that because I don™t mean to say that 
some of the issues that people raise 
around here are not legitimate issues. 
They are, but sometimes the legit-
imacy of the issueŠthe importance of 
the issueŠhas to be weighed on a scale 
against the gravity of the moment. I would say to you: If we were dealing with permanent policy in the normal 
course of business or even in a moment 
of a cyclical economic downturn, we 
would have some weeks to make some 
of these decisions. We have already 
taken too long. People got laid off today. People will be laid off tonightŠand tomorrow and 
the day after and for days to comeŠ 
even if we pass this bill. Imagine if we 
don™t. What we are facing is the toughest thing this generation has ever faced. 
There is no doubt about it. There is no 
doubt about it. Perhaps with the excep-
tion of the gentleman that called me 
this morning, it will be the toughest 
thing we ever face in our lives. World 
War II was worse. This virus is terrible, 
but it will not last as long or kill as 
many people as that war did, but it will 
kill far too many people and last far 
too long. It will last longer and kill 
more if we don™t take action now. That 
requires everyone to finally wake up 
and realize this virus does not care 
whom you voted for in the last elec-
tion. It doesn™t care what you write on 
Twitter or what snarky remarks you 
come up with in your commentator 
moment on cable news. It doesn™t care 
about any of that stuff. It doesn™t care 
whom you plan to vote for in the next 
election. It will infect you. It will kill 
you. It will kill people you love. It will 
kill members of your family. It will 
disrupt your community and your 
economy. It doesn™t care about any of 
this other stuff. It really is important for us to real-izeŠnot just for this bill but moving 
forwardŠthat there is no such thing as 
an outcome here that is good for half of 
us and bad for the other half. There is 
no possible political victory hereŠ 
none. There is no outcome here in 
which half of us are going to be able to 
go back and say: Boy, we really looked 
good, and we made those guys look 
really bad, and people are going to re-
ward us for it. They are not. I promise you, when someone has lost their job and does not know where they 
are going to go, is stuck in their home 
and their life has been turned upside 
down, and a member of their family is 
in intensive care, and they wind up at 
a hospital that has been overwhelmed 
and can™t care for them, the last thing VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00020Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.028S25MRPT1
dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDŠSENATE
S2041 March 25, 2020 on their mind is going to be partisan politics or preexisting differences. If you don™t believe it, we are about to find that out, unfortunately. There 
is no outcome here which half of us are 
happy and the other half are upset. It is a cliche. We use it all the time. I can™t think of a better example than 
this one: We are truly all in this to-
gether. The carnage, the damage that 
this will do to our country is extraor-
dinary. It will know no geographic 
bounds, no political affiliation, no de-
mographic differences. This is a virus 
that can infect the heir to the Crown in 
Britain just as easily as it can a 92- 
year-old retiree in a Florida nursing 
home. I hope the gravity of the moment fi-nally sinks in and that we take the 
necessary actions quickly. If there is 
something in this bill you really don™t 
likeŠI don™t mean to diminish itŠif we 
can fix it, we should. But at this point, 
I am going to tell you that there is 
nothing wrong in this bill. There is 
nothing in this bill that will damage 
our country more than our inability to 
act. No matter how bad you think 
some provision in this bill may beŠand 
I say this to both sidesŠthere is noth-
ing in this bill that will damage us 
more than doing nothing. By far, the 
most damaging thing that can happen 
is not any provision of this legislation. 
It is our inability to act and to send a 
message to the American people that 
their leaders can™t function, that their 
government doesn™t workŠnot just on 
a day-to-day basis but in a moment of 
crisis. I hope that whatever differences may still exist at this momentŠand I am 
trying to be fair because I know a lot 
of people have finally seen the full text 
of it in the last few hoursŠand if you 
have caught something that can be 
fixed, it should be fixed. But I pleadŠ 
I don™t know what other word to useŠ 
that we don™t leave here tonight with-
out having passed this bill because I 
honestly don™t know how this Nation 
and our people can afford one more day 
of this. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. UDALL. Madam President, today New Mexico and the Nation face a pan-
demic, the likes of which we have not 
seen in over 100 years, and today the 
Senate must act to pass the largest re-
lief package for the American people in 
our history. First, I would like to extend my thoughts and prayers to everyone who 
is personally affected by this 
coronavirus pandemic. I thank the 
healthcare workers for working long hours and risking their own health to save lives. They are performing a na-
tional service. The numbers of infected individuals and the rapidly rising death toll are 
staggering. If we do not follow public 
health experts™ advice, the tolls could 
be truly horrifying. In New Mexico, we have over 100 di-agnosed cases, and today the first 
death in our State was reported. A sen-
ior citizen from Eddy County in the 
southeastern part of our State passed 
away on Sunday. All New Mexicans are facing new challengesŠa threat to our health, a 
threat to our economy. My top priority 
is easing this hardship and making 
sure New Mexicans have what they 
need to stay healthy and to stay eco-
nomically afloat. With that in mind, I rise today to tell New Mexicans: Relief is on the way: re-
lief to American workers who have 
been put out of work and to small busi-
nesses that are making impossible de-
cisions because of the coronavirus pan-
demic; relief to our hospitals and front-
line healthcare workers facing an over-
whelmed healthcare system in the 
coming weeks and months; and relief 
to State and local governments that 
are doing their best to take care of 
their residents and maintain essential 
servicesŠState and local governments 
are desperately in need of assistance 
only the Federal Government can pro-
vide; and Tribal governments to whom 
we owe trust and treaty obligations to 
provide healthcare, education, and 
community assistance, particularly in 
times of need. After days of furious negotiations, I am pleased and relieved that Demo-
crats and Republicans were able to 
reach agreement on what will be the 
largest Federal relief effort in our his-
tory. The times demand a response of 
this magnitude. The stay-at-home ordersŠwhich, make no mistake, are necessary to stop 
the virusŠthreaten the livelihoods of 
millions of working families who live 
paycheck to paycheck. Millions of small businesses are in dire need of help. They power our econ-
omy but simply can™t survive during 
the kind of economic downturn we now 
face. The Federal Government has the power to make sure that people can 
take the public health measures that 
are necessary, while also staying afloat 
financially. We here in the Senate need to make absolutely sure that everyoneŠnot just 
those at the topŠthat everyone is 
taken care of and can weather this cri-
sis. I am strongly supportive of the small business relief in this bill, which in-
cludes loans of up to $10 million that 
can be forgiven and turned into grants 
if employees are kept on the payroll. 
This relief will go through the Small 
Business Administration and be avail-
able to any business or nonprofit under 
500 employees. With Democrats at the negotiating table, we worked toward that goal. As a result, American work-
ers will receive 4 months more of un-
employment insurance instead of just 
3. Because so many Americans are now out of work, we need an expanded un-
employment insurance plan. This plan 
extends unemployment to the self-em-
ployed for the first time. It increases 
the maximum benefit by $600 per week. 
Many workers will receive their full 
pay under this expansion. Just to give an idea of the magnitude of this problem in my home State of 
New Mexico, during the week of March 
9, we had fewer than 800 claims for un-
employment. This last week we had 
11,000, and now we are receiving 7,000 
every day. Also, because Democrats stood firm, our healthcare system will see an infu-
sion of $55 billion more into the Mar-
shall Plan for healthcare. The total 
public healthcare investment in this 
bill is now $150 billion dollars. We will 
establish a $150 billion relief fund for 
State, local, and Tribal governments to 
help cover costs of fighting this virus. 
New Mexico is eligible for up to $1.25 
billion from this fund. And we will bring accountability and transparency to the relief for industry 
and large corporations. This relief bill 
puts in transparency and independent 
oversight and also makes sure that 
elected politicians, including the Presi-
dent, are not the beneficiaries of this 
fund. We face a national crisis of monu-mental proportions, and I am heart-
ened that Republicans and Democrats 
in this body joined together over the 
last several days to face this crisis to-
gether as a nation. This is what we do 
as Americans, and I have hoped that as 
we continue to face down this crisis in 
the coming weeks and months, we will 
continue to do so in a united fashion. As vice chair of the Senate Indian Af-fairs Committee, I have been particu-
larly focused on making sure that In-
dian Country is not left out and ensur-
ing that Tribes, which are on the 
frontlines of this public health and eco-
nomic crisis, have the resources they 
need and deserve. Together, with my Democratic col-leagues, I fought for and secured an $8 
billion set-aside for Tribal govern-
ments and their enterprises. This Trib-
al Relief Fund will provide the 574 fed-
erally recognized Indian Tribes with 
flexible resourcesŠresources they need 
during the COVIDŒ19 response, and I 
am glad we found bipartisan agreement 
on this. We also secured over $2 billion in emergency funding for Tribal needs, 
and this includes over $1 billion for the 
Indian Health Service that will be used 
for everything from expanding medical 
services to purchasing equipment, to 
promoting public health education, to 
expanding telehealth services, and in-
creasing disease surveillance, over $700 
million that will go to the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Indian VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00021Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.030S25MRPT1

S2042 March 25, 2020 Education, and the HUD Office of Na-tive American Programs. These funds 
will assist Tribal governments as they 
make their way through this crisis and 
support their membersŠsupport BIE 
schools and Tribal colleges and univer-
sities so that students continue with 
their education and provide housing for 
those most in need who are impacted 
by this terrible virus. These are key victories, but we are not done. We must uphold our trust and treaty responsibilities to all Amer-
ican Indians and Alaska Natives. So Congress must do more to respond to the unique COVIDŒ19-related public 
health and economic crises in Indian 
Country. Tribes are some of the most 
vulnerable populations with the least 
robust healthcare systems. We have a 
very scary outbreak on the Navajo Na-
tion, and I am sure that we need to 
weigh in and help there. For our next response packageŠand, believe me, we are going to have to 
monitor this closely and in all likeli-
hood will be back here againŠwe must 
make sure Indian Country has equal 
access to Federal coronavirus re-
sources. Senator HEINRICHand I fought hard for New Mexico priorities. We are 
working hard on issues that have to do 
with our National Labs, one of our 
very, very top employersŠin fact, 
probably the biggest. New Mexico™s creative economy can™t be left behind. Sitting as the lead Dem-
ocrat on the Appropriations Sub-
committee that funds the national en-
dowments, I pushed for an additional 
$75 million for both the National En-
dowment for the Arts and the National 
Endowment for the Humanities. These 
funds will support local artists and art 
programs through this tough economic 
time. When arts and cultural venues 
are shuttered and artists and all others 
are out of work, there is no doubt that 
these are exceedingly difficult times, 
but together we can get through this. I would like to remind everyone to follow the public health measures rec-
ommended by the experts. Staying at 
home is the best thing we can do to 
slow the spread of this virus and ensure 
our healthcare systems are not over-
run. These measures are a firebreak 
that cuts off the fuel for this virus and 
prevents a catastrophe that overruns 
our hospitals. Social distance, washing 
your hands for 20 secondsŠwe all have 
an important part to play in con-
taining COVIDŒ19, keeping ourselves 
and our neighbors and our commu-
nities safe. The State of New Mexico is under a stay-at-home order. I commend Gov-
ernor Lujan Grisham for the quick and 
decisive action that she has taken. She 
is focusing on this like a laser beam. I 
know these measures are difficult and 
a hardship for many, but we will only 
be able to revive our economy once this 
public health crisis is abated. If we just 
let the virus run its course, we could 
lose over 1 million people. Some esti-
mates are 2 millionŠ1 to 2 million peo-
ple. That would be totally unaccept-
able and devastating. Because of the frontline healthcare workersŠthe doctors, nurses, and tech-
nicians and all those who support that 
work, hospital janitors, cafeteria work-
ers, and so many othersŠthis public 
health crisis will see an end. Thank 
you to everyone who is risking their 
own safety to help others. Thanks to 
all the Senate staff who are here on the 
floor and the people who work here. In the days, weeks, and months ahead, we must continue to closely 
monitor all aspects of the impact of 
coronavirus on our Nation™s health and 
economy and continue to decisively 
and aggressively respond to the needs 
of the American people. I am confident 
that, in working together as one Na-
tion and one people, we will meet and 
beat this crisis and come out on the 
other end stronger. To conclude, we must pass this bill without delay. This is a good com-
promise, and we must act now. I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senators have been working very hard 
to respond to the crisis that is facing 
our whole Nation. Each one of our 
States is unique, but we also are here 
for all of America. All of America is 
suffering. I know my staff in Vermont, my staff down here, the appropriators, and the 
Appropriations staff have been working 
every day and every night till midnight 
or later. Nobody has had any time off. 
I am proud to work with them, even 
though we have set up the capability to 
telework, as I would hope all would do, 
so we can work remotely. Earlier this week, we were faced with the prospect of a bill that was very 
one-sided. Republicans and Democrats 
had not done what we do best, sitting 
down and reaching a bipartisan agree-
ment. We were given almost a take-it- 
or-leave-it bill. I applaud Senator 
SCHUMERwho said we should come back together. Let™s not pass a bill 
that leaves out so much of America 
and so many of the people we rep-
resent. Let us come together, Repub-
licans and Democrats, and find a way. Now, late last nightŠactually it was close to this morningŠagreement was 
reached, in principle, on such a bill. 
The appropriators do only part of it, 
but Senator SHELBYand I tried to work together to have something the vast 
majority of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, Republicans and Democrats, 
would agree on, and we did that, and 
that is what we have before us. Both parties have worked so hard to put together something we can all 
agree on. We should be able to vote. I 
agree with the discussions that Sen-
ator SCHUMERhad this morning. We all know that none of us got every single thing we want, just as I am sure my 
Republican friends did not get every 
single thing they want. And is any bill 
perfect, especially something of this 
unprecedented magnitude? Of course 
not. But we are at a point where re-
ality has to overcome rhetoric. We 
have to stand up and be the conscience 
of the Nation, as we have been in the 
past and we can be today. It is time for 
Senators to come together and vote. I know that on our side, under the lead-
ership of Senator SCHUMERand others, we are ready to do that. I am the dean of the Senate. I have been here the longest. I am not going 
to get everything I want, neither is the 
Presiding Officer, and neither is any-
one here. But America will get a lot 
more than it has now. Let™s do this for America. Vote on it. As Americans, we should say that it is 
reality time, not rhetoric time. Reality 
trumps rhetoric any day. Let™s go 
ahead and vote. I commend those Senators in the Re-publican Party and those Senators in 
the Democratic Party who have 
worked so closely with each other. I 
know we have in Appropriations. It is 
time to say: OK. Let™s vote. With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CRAMER). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. TRIBUTETONORMANBORLAUG
 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know we have a very important piece 
of legislation before us to turn this 
economy around and help in our battle 
against the virus. While we are waiting 
to vote on that, I have come to the 
floor for a couple of points that I would 
like to make. The first one is to honor a famous Iowan. This month is Iowa History 
Month, so I have come to the floor to 
speak about one of Iowa™s favorite 
sons, Dr. Norman Borlaug, whose birth-
day is today. He is considered the father of the Green Revolution. Raised on a farm 
near Cresco, IA, Borlaug is credited 
with saving more lives than anyone in 
history with his breakthroughs in 
agronomy. It took him several years to 
accomplish what a lot of scientists do 
now in a laboratory in regard to fight-
ing diseases in plants. He did this in 
Mexico and India. His work helped to overcome mal-nutrition and famine across the world, 
saving over 1 billion lives in the proc-
ess. His achievements won him the Nobel Peace PrizeŠnot only that famous 
prize but also the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom and the Congressional Gold 
Medal. I think there are only five or six 
people who fall into the category of 
winning all three of those prizes. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00022Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.031S25MRPT1

S2043 March 25, 2020 His achievements also prompted the State of Iowa to honor him with one of 
Iowa™s two statues in Statuary Hall 
here in the U.S. Capitol. CORONAVIRUS Mr. President, on another subject, some pundits, and even Members of 
this body, have suggested that it is in-
appropriate to criticize the Chinese 
Communist Party for its mishandling 
of the coronavirus that originated in 
Wuhan, China, because it distracts 
from bashing the President. We went 
from mainstream media outlets rou-
tinely referring to the virus by its ori-
gin to this being totally politically in-
correct. There is an excellent timetable pub-lished by Axios that lays out the Chi-
nese coverup that prevented early ac-
tion to contain the virus. The Chinese 
pro-democracy activist, Wei Jingsheng, 
warned that General Secretary Xi is 
ordering people back to work pre-
maturely, risking another massive out-
break of what he called Wuhan pneu-
monia. Telling the truth about the Com-munist Party™s misdeeds does not pre-
clude talking about how we can im-
prove our own response. We can learn 
from free countries like South Korea, 
which has been able to contain a wide-
spread outbreak, and Taiwan and 
Japan, which appear to have been able 
to prevent widespread outbreaks. So this is not the time for political correctness or political point-scoring 
to get in the way of telling the truth or 
working together in a clear-eyed way 
to address the challenges at hand. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I came to this building, this Capitol, about 12 
hours ago today and, first thing this 
morning, recorded a video to share on 
social media with the folks back home, 
who have been eagerly asking: What is 
up? What is happening? What is next? My message has been simple. 
After days of disagreementŠof tus-sling and of fighting and of craftingŠ 
we have a deal, and I am ready to vote. 
Let™s move forward. Twelve hours 
later, I stand in a largely empty Cham-
ber and have an odd sense of fore-
boding, as I have all day and as have 
many of my colleagues, wondering: 
What is taking so long? What is the 
delay? What are the remaining issues? 
I am hopeful, prayerfully, that we will 
resolve what is left, move to this 
Chamber, take up the text, vote it out, 
send it to the House, send it to the 
President, and send $2 trillion in sup-
port to our Nation. Let me tell you, as I have waited today and yesterday and as I have taken phone calls for whatever reason from the folks from Delaware, they 
have all asked: When will the Senate 
act? We have faced a challenge over the last couple of days between our moving 
swiftly and our moving wisely in put-
ting together a package of this size. 
With no hearings, no committee pro-
ceedings, and no detailed legislative 
process, it means that there will be 
rough edges, and it means there will be 
mistakes in this bill. Is it perfect? No. 
In fact, some of its pieces, as we will 
discover as it unfolds, are far from it. But across the country, just as in this Chamber, there is that sense of 
anxiousness, of anxiety, of when will it 
happen. Just a few weeks ago, the vast major-ity of our country was reading about 
coronavirusŠabout COVIDŒ19Šas 
something happening in distant coun-
tries on far shores. They read about 
sort of concerns about its alarming and 
rapid growth in Asia and then Europe. Things started changing as the sto-ries got more dire and more grave, as 
public health officials began to predict 
a global pandemic, as the World Health 
Organization announced it is a global 
pandemic, as scientific leaders began 
to say that the United States would in-
evitably be touched by it, as our col-
leagues from the Pacific Northwest 
told us about how their communities 
were being affected, as extended con-
tacts and friends and acquaintances on 
social media and then on the press 
shared how they are or members of 
their community had become infected. As it began to move across our coun-try, it began to impact a remarkable 
range of institutions, from baseball to 
Broadway, the closures of all sorts of 
treasured American institutionsŠ 
every major sports league, every major 
public gathering. And as now State after State has issued edicts, as city and county alike 
all over our country have asked people 
to close their restaurants and their 
bars, their small businesses, as hotels 
have no occupants, as airplanes fly 
with no passengers, it has become 
haunting, eerieŠthe sense of an immi-
nent disaster. Just before coming over here I read an article in the New York Times 
about how in my region, in the mid-At-
lantic, it has hit. In the borough of 
Queens, in the city of New York, in a 
public hospital known as Elmhurst, 
yesterday, 13 patients died, and in a 
riveting account, the nurses and the 
doctors describe a catastrophic situa-
tion. Public health officials, trained health aids stretched to their limits, 
tested as they hadn™t been before, 
struggling to get personal protective 
equipment, to have enough ventilators, 
to have enough ICU unitsŠand I will 
tell you, as, over the last couple of 
days, I have talked with the heads of 
each of our major hospitals, folks who 
run skilled nursing facilities, non-
profits, community health centers, as I have heard from nurses and doctors, I know the level of alarm and concern 
has steadily risen in recent days. So, folks, tonight, as I stand here on the floor of the Senate, I am mindful 
that our Nation is suffering; that there 
are people all over the world but par-
ticularly here in the United States, in 
the States that we represent, who are 
anxious, who are unemployed, who are 
uncertain, in some cases now, too 
many who are infected, who are hos-
pitalized. It has come home to this Chamber, as one of our colleagues has tested posi-
tive and one of our dear colleague™s 
husband, her spouse, is hospitalized. We know Members of the House and the Senate, of our staff, and our imme-
diate community have been touched by 
this dread disease. And we are now at a critical moment in our modern historyŠsimultaneously 
a public health crisis and an economic 
crisis. I have heard too many people say it is unprecedented. It is not unprece-
dented. The United States and our Na-
tion have made it through tougher 
times than this. To say that the Great 
Depression and the Second World War, 
the Civil War, and the Revolution, the 
hard work of labor organizing, and the 
desperate work of throwing off the 
shackles of segregation and of Jim 
CrowŠto say that those weren™t tough 
and difficult struggles misses the sig-
nificance of our history and the things 
we have overcome. But for most of us, for most of our families, for most of our communities, 
this wave, this pandemic, this virus, 
and the combined health and economic 
disaster that is upon us may be the 
greatest test we have faced. So how have we answered thousands of businesses already closed, millions 
of people already unemployed, and a 
nation fearful of a pandemic swamping 
the resources of our hospitals and our 
health system? Let me just speak briefly in broad strokes to what is in this bill, which we 
have, finally, ultimately, hammered 
out after days of disagreement and in 
advance of our getting the final official 
text. In the broadest strokes, the help that will be delivered to the American peo-
ple by this bill starts with individual assistanceŠsomething the President 
has championed and the Democrats 
have supported. We have had different 
versions of it, but we have roughly 
agreed on $1,200 to every adult citizen 
making below $75,000, and it phases out 
to those making below $100,000. With 
$500 per child, your average family 
might well see $3,000 to $4,000. These 
checks will come out in weeks, deliv-
ered directly, for those with direct de-
posit through the IRS, or by check to 
those harder to find who haven™t filed 
recently but are eligible. This is a remarkable, direct support to help millions of Americans have 
cash in their family checkbook to get 
through the unexpected hardship of 
these next few months. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00023Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.035S25MRPT1
dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDŠSENATE
S2044 March 25, 2020 There is more than $100 billion in this bill to support our health workers 
on the frontline and the hospitals that 
make our public health possibleŠpos-
sible. You heard that story about Elmhurst Hospital. In my own home State, there 
are hospitals rural and urban, large 
and small, that without this support 
will struggle to make it through this 
period. The heroes of this period are the folks who are workingŠthe folks who 
are cleaning offices, trains, hospital 
rooms, often without enough protec-
tive equipment, often without 
healthcare themselves, often without 
adequate pay; the folks who labor at 
night here in this Capitol in our offices 
to make sure they are clean and safe 
from this virus we can™t see; the folks 
who work in public hospitals, work 
long hours. They are orderlies, they are 
nurses. They are the paramedics and 
the ambulance drivers who deliver the 
sick, and they are the surgeons and the 
doctors who direct their care. And one of the things I am proudest of that is in this now that was not in 
this several days ago is $150 billion to 
States and counties and cities. In the 10 years I spent in county gov-ernment, I came to deeply respect the 
men and women who help keep our 
county government afloat and our 
communities stronger, safer, and 
healthy. This direct support to the 
States and the counties on the 
frontlines of this pandemic will help 
them get through. There is a $500 billion fundŠthe sub-ject of much discussion and debateŠ 
that, as initially written and proposed, 
would help sustain some of our iconic 
industries like the airlines, but with 
almost no transparency, in terms of 
the terms of the loans or the grants 
that would be given, and almost no re-
strictions on how the companies to re-
ceive them might use them, for what 
purposes. Broadly speaking, after days of fight-ing, we have come to agreements that 
I support and embraceŠrestrictions on 
buybacks and dividends and executive 
compensation, guarantees against lay-
offs and against the destruction of col-
lective bargaining agreements, and, 
broadly speaking, transparency and ac-
countability. One of the things I am most proud of is that there will be now an account-
ability board, a pandemic response ac-
countability committeeŠboth an in-
spector general, a special inspector 
general, and $80 million in this bill for the operation of that accountability 
committee. Let me move, since I see I have a number of colleagues who have joined 
me on the floor, to just a few other 
points, if I could. There is $350 billion in this bill for the Small Business Administration to 
disburse to small businesses and to 
nonprofits all over our country, with 
an incentive structure to change it 
from a loan to a grant to those who 
would retain or rehire their workforce. As I have heard from restaurant own-ers, from hotel owners, from those who 
work in bars and restaurants and ho-
tels in my community, those are the 
folks who have been hit the first and 
the hardest by the closures. This provi-
sion will allow those small businesses 
to reopen quickly and robustly when 
we get on the other side of this pan-
demic. And I look forward to working with my colleagues, with the SBA Adminis-
trator, with the SBA lenders in my 
State and around the country to make 
sure it is done well and that it is done 
quickly. I wrote the bill that added $17 billion more so that 320,000 current small busi-
nesses, which are current SBA 
loanholders, get 6 months of relief, 
moves them off the agenda of the SBA 
staff and the SBA lenders to clear the 
decks for them to administer this $350 
billion. And I supported Senator CARDINin his initiative to add $10 billion for 
small, rapid grants to the most se-
verely impacted businesses and non-
profits. This section of the overall bill, where Senators RUBIOand COLLINS, CARDIN and SHAHEENnegotiated most of it, struck me as the most bipartisan and 
most productive. There is so much more in this bill I could speak toŠthe ways in which the 
resources of the Federal Reserve are 
going to be deployed to help medium 
businesses and small businesses; the 
ways in which the private sector in my 
home State has stepped up to partner 
and to deliver critically needed re-
sources, whether it is refurbishing ven-
tilators or donating surplus PPE from 
the construction sector that they don™t 
need today, or it is the university that 
has closed its research labs but makes 
its resources available to our hospital. There are some remarkable efforts in partnership going on in my community 
and around the country. But at the end 
of the day, we have a critical question: 
Is this bill perfect? No. Could we improve it by more time here arguing with each other, offering 
more minutes, debating further? Yes. Is there something I badly wanted that did not get in this final bill? Abso-
lutely. We have had nine major States delay their elections, delay their Presi-
dential primaries because of this pan-
demic, and I urged that a bill written 
by my colleagues Senator KLOBUCHAR and Senator WYDEN, that I joined, be added in text to require every State to 
have a plan to vote by mail during this 
pandemic. If our troops could vote from 
the frontlines in the Civil War and Sec-
ond World War, by gosh, we should 
have a plan to vote even if this pan-
demic continues. I was disappointed that text is ulti-mately not going to be in this bill. 
Four hundred million dollars will be in 
to help those States that want to vote 
by mail, to expand and strengthen vote 
by mail, and I will be back. I will be back to insist on this provision in the next bill. But as I have said to many colleagues in the last few days, we cannot all get 
everything we hope for and want and 
believe to be important in this bill. We 
must put down the tools of partisan-
ship and personal interest and sec-
tional concerns; we must put down 
some of the things we most hope for; 
we must put down the tools with which 
we so often fight each other; and we 
must come together and take up the 
implements of national purpose, of 
compromise, of consensus, and deliver 
these resources to a nation anxious, 
concerned, and at times even angry at 
all of us in the Senate for what they 
see as too long a delay. So with that, let me just say to my colleagues, it is time for us to take up 
this bill, rough-hewn as it is, pass it 
through this Chamber, send it to the 
House. I urge my colleagues in the 
House to pass it promptly, send to it 
the President™s desk for signature, and 
then let us all get to the hard work of 
making sure we do the best we can for 
the people we represent with this his-
toric stimulus package, this remark-
able coronavirus relief package that is 
going to deliver $2 trillion of assistance 
and support to communities all over 
our country. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Nevada. Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I rise today to let all Nevadans know 
the important steps Congress is taking 
to respond to the pandemic we are fac-
ing right now. The novel coronavirus represents a global challenge to the health and eco-
nomic security of Nevada and the 
United States. My thoughts today are with those in Nevada who are ill or suffering with 
the virus, and with the families of the 
six Nevadans who have died because of this disease. I also want to thank the brave men and women on the frontlines of this 
crisisŠthe first responders and 
healthcare workers who are battling to 
save lives, putting their own health 
and the health of their families at risk. I know there is a lot of fear and con-fusion in our communities right now. 
Please know this, though: I am work-
ing closely with Governor Sisolak and 
the Nevada delegation to ensure that 
our State gets the resources it needs to 
stem the spread of the coronavirus, to 
treat those who need medical atten-
tion, and address the needs of strug-
gling families and businesses. I also know that we are Nevada strong. I have seen over and over again 
that when things get difficult, Nevad-
ans come together. When a gunman at-
tacked the Route 91 Harvest Festival 
in Las Vegas, I saw how Nevadans from 
all over the State worked heroically to 
help victims and support families. Nevadans are uniting now too. I am proud to say that across the Silver 
State, people are doing their part to re-
duce the impact of COVIDŒ19. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00024Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.037S25MRPT1
dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDŠSENATE
S2045 March 25, 2020 Our Governor, Steve Sisolak, has shown tremendous leadership in work-
ing to slow the spread of the 
coronavirus. As Governor Sisolak has 
pointed out, if ‚‚Home Means Nevada,™™ 
we need everyone who can to ‚‚stay 
home for Nevada.™™ Our nurses, doctors, and other health officials are working tirelessly to care 
for the sick and to increase our capac-
ity to deal with the cases in the future. 
First responders, local health authori-
ties, sanitation workers, and retail 
workers are on the job around the 
clock to make sure essential services 
are available to Nevadans. Our gaming, 
entertainment, and hospitality indus-
try leaders took unprecedented steps to 
stop the spread of infection, including 
by closing their doors. So many Nevadans are contributing by working from home when they can, 
caring for school-aged children, volun-
teering to help make masks or buy gro-
ceries for elderly neighbors, and avoid-
ing social interactions that could 
spread the virus. EveryoneŠevery single Nevadan and each and every AmericanŠhas a role to 
play in this crisis. We need everyone to 
do their part by following the advice of 
the experts and taking practical, com-
monsense steps such as washing hands 
and practicing social distancing. My colleagues and I in Congress have done our part as well. The Senate has 
come together in a remarkable and bi-
partisan fashion to act on three bills to 
address key healthcare priorities and 
to protect workers and industry from 
the economic impacts of the public 
health crisis. Earlier in March, we set aside $8.3 billion to support hospitals, commu-
nity health centers, public health of-
fices, medical suppliers, and research-
ers across the country. Next, we passed the bipartisan Fami-lies First Coronavirus Response Act to 
provide free coronavirus testing, ex-
pand food assistance, and mandate paid 
sick and family leave for workers. I am proud to have fought alongside my colleagues in the Nevada congres-
sional delegation, including my friend 
and colleague Senator JACKYROSEN, to pass today™s third relief bill. We must 
pass this today. It is quite simply the 
greatest single investment in our econ-
omy and healthcare system in modern 
American history, and we need it. In 2007, our State was hit hard by the recession. Through tremendous effort, 
we came through it, but our economic 
recovery was slow. This time, we want 
to make sure that our economy springs 
back quickly after this crisis has 
passed and that workers have good jobs 
to return to when it does. That is why 
we need to pass these far-reaching 
measures to provide immediate relief 
to individuals, families, and businesses 
suffering from the economic impact of 
this pandemic. Nevada has an economy that is unique in the Nation. Our hospitality 
industry generates nearly $68 billion 
annually and supports more than 450,000 jobs across the State. So I have been focused on standing up for our 
gaming, tourism, and hospitality work-
ers. I also wanted to make sure that 
when we offered relief to big compa-
nies, there was oversight, trans-
parency, accountability, and worker 
protections in place. This bill does 
that. I am grateful to the many small busi-nesses in my State that have taken the 
hard but necessary action and closed 
their doors or reduced their services at 
this critical time. This bill supports 
them as well by providing forgivable 
loans and grants so they can open their 
doors again as soon as it is safe for 
them to do so. Most of all, I wanted to make sure we supported Nevada™s workers and their 
families, the hard-working people our 
industries employ. That is why I 
worked with my colleagues to ensure 
key protections for Nevadans and all 
Americans were included in this relief 
package. We fought to expand unem-
ployment assistance so it includes 
part-time, self-employed, and seasonal 
and gig economy workers, who make 
up a key part of our workforce in the 
Silver State. Whether you are a dishwasher at a hotel on the Strip or a hair stylist in 
Carson City, you will be eligible for up 
to 4 months of unemployment benefits. 
Yes, we locked down direct payments 
of $1,200 for each adult and $500 for 
each child, up to a certain income 
level, so our hard-working families 
would have money in their pockets to 
recover from this pandemic. We suc-
cessfully pushed to shore up our hos-
pitals and our healthcare infrastruc-
ture, to get them more money for pro-
tective gear, supplies, and tests so they 
can provide patients the best possible 
care, while at the same time protecting 
themselves. We made sure that we also included our local, State, and Tribal commu-
nities. We set aside $150 billion for our 
governments that are bearing the 
brunt of the costs for their local 
healthcare systems. That is why I support this legisla-tion, and that is why we have to pass 
this tonight. I would be remiss if I did not say thank you to the incredible staff who 
worked so hard these past few days, 24/ 
7, to put this relief package together in 
a bipartisan wayŠLeader SCHUMER™s staff and Leader SCHUMER, the negoti-ating team, the Senators whom I get to 
work with every single day, their hard- 
working staffs, and my staff as well, 
who worked late nights to make sure 
that we were fighting on behalf of Ne-
vadans. I know this is a difficult time for ev-eryone, but we are going to get through 
this just as we persevered before. We 
will do it by rallying around one an-
other, as Nevadans always do. There will be moments of challenge ahead, 
and each of us has a responsibility to 
answer these questions. Let™s listen to the experts, let™s take care of one another, and let™s be kind and understanding of what we are all going through. But let™s not lose sight 
of the beauty of our everyday lives, 
that familiar rhythm we are all eager 
to restore. In Nevada and across the 
country, we will be back at our work-
places again, solving our everyday 
problems. Our children will be back at 
school learning for themselves how to 
make the world a better place. Yes, we 
will begin the long task of grieving 
those we have lost, but we will also be 
celebrating marriages again and mark-
ing births with a newfound joy. We will get through this together, and I promise everyone in the Silver 
State that I will be fighting in the Sen-
ate to make sure we rebound from this 
stronger than before so that Nevadans 
can get back to work. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Carolina. Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleagues Senators 
RICKSCOTT, TIMSCOTT, and Senator SASSE. Today, when we were getting briefed about the bill, something hit me like a 
ton of bricks. And there are a lot of 
good things in here. There is money for 
healthcare providers, nurses, doctors, 
and hospitals. There are so many good 
things. The country is under siege. I was one of the first Republicans to join my 
Democratic colleagues. I think I talked 
to Senator DURBIN. We need to do something more on un-employment insurance because the 
Collins-Rubio construct, I think, will 
help, but some people are going to fall 
through the cracks. Never in my wildest dreams, Senator DURBIN, did I believe that what we have done is to pay people more not to work 
than to work. Under this bill, the $600 
payment on top of State benefits actu-
ally allows people to have their income 
almost doubled in certain cir-
cumstances. I want to help people. I want to make sure that if you lose 
your job, we cover your wages. But 
under this bill, you get $23.15 an hour 
based on a 40-hour workweek not to 
work. If you are trying to hire somebody in South Carolina the next 4 months, you 
have got to compete with that wage. If 
you are working in a restaurantŠprob-
ably not nowŠbut if you are working 
anywhere for $15 an hour, somebody is 
making $23 an hour, and you are work-
ing. It is just not fair. It is going to 
hurt the Rubio-Collins construct. For restaurants that are out of busi-ness, we want them to be able to bor-
row money to pay the payroll to keep 
people connected to their employer. 
Now, what do you do when you make 
$23 an hour being on unemployment? 
How do you keep that waitress or bar-
tender at $15 or $17? You made it a 
nightmare for small businesses. They 
are being pitted against their own em-
ployees. So to Senator DURBINand everybody else, the reason we are doing this is be-
cause they tell me it takes 6 to 8 VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00025Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.039S25MRPT1
dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDŠSENATE
S2046 March 25, 2020 months for unemployment commis-sions at the State level to figure this 
out. What are we asking you to do? To get unemployment, you have to tell us 
where you work and how much you 
make. And what we want to do is fill in 
the difference between the State unem-
ployment benefit and your actual 
wages and stop there. We don™t do that 
under this bill. There are people get-
ting paid more not to work than they 
were in the workforce. It is going to be 
hard to not incentivize people to leave 
their jobs. You can be unemployed at 
$23 an hour in South Carolina. That is 
a lot more than people make. So I am urging my colleagues, we need to fix this now. No matter how 
well-intentioned, you are going to 
make the next 4 months impossible for 
small businesses to hire. I can promise 
you this: If you pay somebody $23 an 
hour not to work, they are probably 
going to find a way to get there rather 
than staying in the workforce, where I 
am sure they would rather be. We have 
created a perverse incentive not to help 
the unemployed person but to destroy 
the ability to stay employed. With that, I would just say to my colleagues, thank you for trying to 
bring common sense back to this body. 
I am very much for this bill that does 
help a lot of people. But we have cre-
ated a Pandora™s box for our economy, 
and I wish we could fix it tonight, and 
if we don™t, we need to keep trying and 
trying and trying. With that, I will yield to my col-leagues. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GARDNER). The Senator from Florida. Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, under this bill as it is written now, the 
government will pay many Americans 
more to be on government assistance 
than they would make if they were 
working at their regular jobs. I support expanding the unemploy-ment insurance program. It is the best 
and quickest way to get money to peo-
ple who need it most. But we should 
not create a system where unemploy-
ment insurance benefits are higher 
than their salary. We cannot pay peo-
ple more to not work than to work. 
This is common sense. Most people will 
choose the bigger check, and I don™t 
blame them at all. No person who understands anything about business, economics, or human 
nature would create such a perverse 
and ridiculous system. This bill creates 
an incentive for people to be unem-
ployed for the next 4 monthsŠfact. 
Without workers, our economy cannot 
reopenŠfact. If our economy remains 
essentially closed for 4 more months, 
we will be in a very deep recessionŠ 
fact. You may ask, how do I know all this? I grew up poor, in public housing. My 
mom worked three jobs. My parents 
were constantly struggling to find 
work. I know what it is like to skip 
Christmas and see the family car repos-
sessed. On the other end of the spec-trum, I have run businesses, small and large, and had great success. That is 
exactly how I know these things. This 
is not conjecture; these are facts. There are many good things in this bill, and there are many provisions 
that I wholeheartedly disagree with, 
but the worst thing we can do right 
now is to create a disincentive to work. 
We can get our economy up and run-
ning again, we can recover from this, 
but it will take a lot longer if we don™t 
amend this bill to eliminate these per-
verse incentives. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Carolina. Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. President, let me be abundantly clear. 
I plan to support this legislation to-
night, but I do want to fix it first. Our amendment is a very simple amendment. First, it is our responsi-
bility to every extent possible to take 
care of the American people. I want to 
provide 100 percent of the salary while 
an American is laid off because of 
COVIDŒ19Š100 percent of the salary of 
someone laid off because of COVIDŒ19. My goal is to do it the right way. The right way is that you get your income 
as if you are still working because you 
have been laid off because of COVIDŒ19. 
It is not a raise for not working. It is 
not 200 percent of your income while on 
unemployment. The goal is simply to 
keep you whole while you are unem-
ployed because of COVIDŒ19. I cannot stress enough, as a former employer, and, frankly, as a former 
employee, the relationship between the 
employer and the employee is critical. 
Our Nation is built on the dignity of 
work. What this bill does, without fixing it, is simply say: You can earn more 
money by being on unemployment than 
you can while working. That isn™t an 
incentive. That is perverse. We cannot 
have intended to encourage people not 
to work and make more money than to 
go back to work and receive their nor-
mal pay. With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Nebraska. Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, as Sen-ator TIMSCOTTjust said and as RICK SCOTTand LINDSEYGRAHAMjust said, this amendment is really, really sim-
ple. All we are trying to say is that we 
should help everyone who needs to be 
helped without accidentally creating a 
disincentive to work. That is not good 
for anybody in the country or the 
country as a whole. We are in the middle of two unprece-dented crises right now. We have a pub-
lic health crisis, and we have an eco-
nomic crisis into which we are just en-
tering. We don™t know how long the 
valley of this recession is going to be, 
but I want to be sure that every Amer-
ican who is watching tonight under-
stands exactly what this debate has 
been about this afternoon. This debate is how you can be both pro-worker and pro-recovery, to be 
kind and charitable, and actually also, simultaneously, affirming the ongoing dignity of work and the necessity of 
work as our country battles through 
this virus and ultimately rebuilds our 
economy. Nobody here is arguing about wheth-er we should help workers. Everybody 
on both sides of the aisle tonight wants 
to help workers. This is a debate about 
whether we are going to let a poorly 
drafted bill knock this Nation still 
harder in the coming months by unin-
tentionally increasing unemployment. 
That is what this debate is about. Right now, as the coronavirus is threatening our economy, we know 
who the real heroes are. The real he-
roes are not politicians. There are a lot 
of people who have been working all 
night, five or six nights in a row, but 
the heroes who are going to beat this 
virus and rebuild America are not poli-
ticians. The heroes are the men and women who are stocking shelves, the men and 
women who are picking up trash, the 
men and women who are driving trucks 
and delivering takeout, many of them 
converting restaurants, which used to 
be sit-down, into takeout restaurants 
and putting food on the table for a lot 
of their neighbors. The Americans who 
are keeping the pharmacies openŠthey 
are the heroes. The daycare workers 
who are doing stuff to watch other ER 
doctors™ kidsŠthose are the heroes. 
The heroes are the Americans across 
all 50 States, across every town and vil-
lage and suburb and city, who are 
doing the work, the ordinary jobs but, 
now, under extraordinarily painful and 
difficult circumstances. They are the 
heroes, the scrappers, and the doers. 
We should be celebrating them, affirm-
ing them, and helping them, once we 
get through this crisis, to get back to 
work. This bill has lots and lots of good stuff in it. I intend to support it, as 
well, but there are pieces of this bill 
that are broken and that we can fix to-
night. If we don™t fix them tonight, it 
is going to exacerbate our problems, 
and we will be coming back here in a 
month or 2 months, trying to fix these 
problems. These are the Americans who are going to get us through. They are the 
people who are going to keep our sup-
ply chains alive, and those supply 
chains are the lifeline for lots of Amer-
icans right now. Here is what is wrong with the bill. As it is currently drafted, it threatens 
to cripple the supply chain for many 
different categories of workersŠsome 
in health sectors and some in food prep 
and food delivery. This bill, as cur-
rently drafted, creates a perverse in-
centive for men and women who are 
sidelined to then not leave the side-
lines to come back to work. This bill 
creates a perverse incentive for many 
employers who should be wanting to 
try to maintain the employer-em-

S2047 March 25, 2020 Many other pieces of this bill tried to tackle this problem in a really con-
structive way. The $350 billion for the 
Small Business AdministrationŠit is 
trying to build bridge loan programs 
that help employers and employees be 
connected and remain connected 
through this downturn. The unemploy-
ment insurance piece of this should not 
work at cross purposes to what the bill 
is about in the overall argument. Nobody has a problem with the gen-erous unemployment benefits that are 
in this bill. Nobody has a problem with 
the generous unemployment insurance 
benefits that are in this bill. They 
should be generous amid the national 
crisis we are in. But we don™t want this 
piece of the bill to create an incentive 
for folks to stop working and to have 
their employers push them away when 
the employer and employee should be 
trying to rally around and together to 
help us build through this crisis. So we want to do something really simple. We want to fix what is broken 
here by saying that unemployment in-
surance benefits should be capped at 
100 percent of the pay you had before 
you were unemployed. This isn™t just 
about people who have already been 
made unemployed. This is about people 
who are going to be made unemployed 
in the coming weeks. All this amendment saysŠwhich we are voting on in a few minutesŠis that 
we should cap the unemployment bene-
fits at 100 percent of the wages you 
were just receiving while working. It 
should not be something the U.S. Con-
gress does to create an incentive where 
you will get paid more by not working 
than you get by working. That is pro- 
recovery legislation that tries to keep 
our supply chains humming and tries 
to help usŠ325 million AmericansŠ 
come together to beat this thing. We should vote for workers. We should vote for recovery, and we should 
vote to beat this thing and come out 
stronger on the other side. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to address this issue because I 
think it is important that we explain 
where we are today and why we 
reached this point. I can recall when Senator GRAHAM crossed the aisle a week or so ago, per-
haps, and started talking about unem-
ployment insurance and his goals for 
unemployment insurance. It sounded 
consistent with the language and con-
versation I heard on our own side of 
the aisle, our own caucus, to use the 
unemployment insurance system as a 
way to make sure that people were able 
to really weather the storm when it 
came to the public health crisis we 
face. The number of people who are filing for unemployment has gone up dra-
matically. There were 2 million new 
unemployment claims filed last week, 
compared to 218,000 nationwide in pre-
vious weeks. So we know that the num-ber of people who have lost their jobsŠ laid off, furloughed, firedŠis growing 
in a fashion we have never seen before. 
I have seen it reported in my State. I 
am sure each of you have seen the 
same. But let™s get down to the bottom line. I ask my colleagues just to bear 
with me for a minute. What you were 
describing is what we initially set out 
to do. And then we met with the rep-
resentatives of the U.S. Department of 
Labor. I was on one of the task forces 
for the Senate Finance Committee, and 
I sat there as a representative from the 
U.S. Department of Labor came in and 
said: Senators, you don™t understand 50 
different States™ computer systems 
when it comes to unemployment bene-
fits. We can tell you point-blank that 
only 6 or 8 States out of the 50 could 
possibly do what you want to achieve. They tell us it will take them months to reprogram their computers 
to make the simple calculationŠwhat 
appears to be a simple calculationŠ 
that says that you never get paid more 
in unemployment than you were mak-
ing on the job. That was the reality. 
We didn™t make that up. This wasn™t a 
Democratic, dreamed-up idea. This was 
the Trump administration™s Depart-
ment of Labor telling us that when 
they looked at the State departments 
of labor, they couldn™t achieve what 
you want to achieve with your amend-
ment. In other words, if you go forward and you are successfulŠI don™t believe you 
will beŠbut if you were successful, 
what we would end up with is, frankly, 
a deadlock: no increases in unemploy-
ment insurance benefits. Now, let me tell you, beyond this ad-ministrative problem, which was not 
our creationŠit was identified by the 
Trump administrationŠthere are two 
or three things I want to say as a bot-
tom line. First, we are determined to make sure that the workers come out at 
least whole, if not better, through this 
terrible experience they are going 
through. Now, this notion that the 
workers would come out better is not 
unique to the Democratic side of the 
aisle. The cash payment proposed by 
the Trump administrationŠ$1,200 per 
adult, $500 per childŠfor some, will be 
a benefit, may even be a small but im-
portant windfall that comes their way. 
So be it. That working families across 
America would end up with this cash 
payment from the Trump administra-
tionŠI don™t object to it at all. But the Democrats have said that is one and done. That is an airdrop of 
cash to people. What about the next 
week and the next month? That is why 
we brought up the unemployment in-
surance. Now, the $600 figure we came 
up with was an attempt to make sure 
that everyone is whole at the end of 
the day. I will concede your point that 
some workersŠsomeŠmay end up com-
ing out ahead because of this calcula-
tion of $600 a week. They may come out 
ahead. I am not going to stand here and say that I feel bad about that. I don™t feel bad about that at all. When 
less than half of the people in America 
have $400 in their savings, the notion 
that we might end up giving people an-
other $1,000 or $2,000 at the end of 4 
months, to me, is not something we 
ought to be ashamed of or run away 
from. That is a real possibility, and it 
may happen. I will support that just as I supported the Trump administration™s cash pay-
ment to that same family. They are 
going through some tough times, and 
they have for a long, long time. How 
many of us have given speeches on this 
floor about income inequality in Amer-
ica, and some of the hardest working 
people are still unable to make it, pay-
check to paycheck, week to week? So let™s give them a helping hand and not apologize for it for a minute. We 
are standing with these workers and 
their families, and I think you want to 
as well. But the way you want to cal-
culate it, we are told, cannot be done. 
It cannot be done in a fashion that 
brings relief to these families when 
they need it right now. Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Will the Senator yield? Mr. DURBIN. I will in just a minute. I am happy to yield as soon as I finish. I want to make this point as clearly as I can. I believe that this is not a 
windfall. Let™s assume that instead of 
$600 a week, your calculation makes it 
$450 a week. So $150 times 16 weeksŠ 
that is 4 months. How much is that 
going to come out to? $2,400? Is that 
going to mean that someone now be-
comes lazy and won™t go back to work? 
I don™t think so. I think a lot of people 
will use that money and need that 
money and are given a helping hand 
and will put it right back in the econ-
omy. That is what this is aboutŠthat 
these families can keep their homes, 
pay their utility bills, put food on the 
table, and put the money back into the 
economy. That is part of what we are 
trying to achieve here. If we err on the side of giving a hard- working family an extra $1,000 or $2,000 
because of our approach, so be it. No 
apologies. We didn™t design this sys-
tem. We were told we had to work 
within the design of the system. We 
tried to do it. We think the $600 a week 
is a reasonable way to do it, and I will 
yield for a question. Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. I thank the Senator. The $600 a week, I 
think, if I do the math quickly, times 
16, is about $9,600. Add on top of that 
the additional $1,200 per person, or 
$2,400 per family, and $500 per kid is an 
important number that we shouldŠI 
think you have hit on the point that 
we should all be willing to agree upon 
that the systems of unemployment 
throughout our country, perhaps, are 
working on antiquated equipment that 
may need to be updated so that we can, 
in fact, keep people whole during their 
unemployment. I would love for us to 
work in a bipartisan fashion to try to 
figure out, through the Department of VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00027Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.042S25MRPT1

S2048 March 25, 2020 Labor, how to fix the problem so that those folks who deserve the benefits 
get all that they deserve but that we 
actually have a system that is nimble 
enough to actually meet the needs, 
State by State, without exceeding the 
need so that when we are in a position 
again, if we are looking at phase 4 or 
phase 5, we are not again having a con-
versation about systems that are so an-
tiquated or perhaps even obsolete that 
we are doing something that was not 
intended. I am not suggesting we can get that done tonight. I am not even suggesting 
we can get that done over the next few 
months. I am, however, concluding 
that we should work to get it done. Mr. DURBIN. I don™t disagree with my friend from South Carolina at all. I 
agree with you completely. We are in 
the midst of a national emergency. Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Abso-lutely. Mr. DURBIN. That is not my an-nouncement. That is the announce-
ment of President Trump. I believe it. 
When you look at all the people now 
filing for unemployment, when you 
look at the hardships they are facing, 
the lifestyles they have had to live to 
try to comply with shelter-in-place and 
all the rules that are going on out 
there, the number of people filing these 
unemployment insurance claims, they 
tell us the reality of the situation. The notion, as you said, $9,600 times threeŠthree times 4 months basically 
comes out to about $30,000 a year, 
roughly. That is what the $600 is cal-
culated to mean on an annual basis. So, on a 4-month basis, if we end up giving people an extra $1,000 or $2,000, 
it is not inconsistent with what the 
Trump administration says they want 
to do with their cash payment. In the 
meantime, if we are going to move for-
wardŠand I hope this crisis comes to 
an end quicklyŠif we are going to 
move forward into a new phaseŠphase 
4, phase 5, whatever it isŠlet™s work 
together to try to upgrade these sys-
tems, to make them work the way we 
want them to work. But in the meantime, wouldn™t we want to err on the side of standing with 
working families and their employees? 
Wouldn™t we want to do that in this 
first effort? I think it is the reasonable 
and thoughtful way to do it. Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. I am happy to answer that question, if the 
gentleman will yield. Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield for a question from my friend 
from South Carolina. Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Thank you, sir. I would say that, on both sides of the aisle, would you not agree that we are 
both trying to get to the place where 
we are, in fact, keeping the average 
person, especially the working-class 
people, whole as we ponder and discuss 
this amendment? Would you agree? Mr. DURBIN. Of course. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. My final thought is that my goal isn™t to come down here and have a disagree-ment, as much as it is to illuminate a 
very important part of the process 
that, if we can get it fixed throughout 
our country as we tackle these issues 
in the future, more folks on both sides 
of the aisle will have greater con-
fidence in giving these resources to the 
States so that our people can be whole. 
That is all I wanted to say. Mr. DURBIN. There is no disagree-ment. I say to my friend from South 
Carolina, there is no disagreement, but 
the U.S. Department of Labor says we 
cannot do that at this moment. And at 
this moment, when people are hurting 
so badly, when they have lost their 
jobs, been furloughed, laid off, and they 
are worried about paying their bills, 
the Trump administration says we are 
going to send them a cash payment. We sayŠand I hope it is a bipartisan statement: We are with you too. It 
isn™t going to end with that one cash 
payment. We are going to stick with 
you and make sure your unemploy-
ment insurance benefits are going to 
keep you and your family together. 
And if, by chance, you come out a little 
bit ahead in this process with the cash 
payment or with the calculation of this 
formula, so be it. So be it. At this moment in history, facing this national emergency, we would 
rather err on the side of your being 
able to pay your bills and keep your 
family together. Future needs, we can 
discuss and we can debate. We can see 
what we can do with the State systems. 
But for the time being, there are no 
apologies. From where I am standing, $600 a week is exactly what Democrats are 
committed toŠI hope Republicans are 
as wellŠbecause our belief is that this 
is the moment when we need to stand 
with these workers. I might say that I support RUBIOand CARDINin their efforts to help small businesses. I think that is the right 
thing to do. It was bipartisan from the 
start and really without much con-
troversy. Have we asked any of those 
businesses to produce net worth state-
ments before they receive those bene-
fits? No, we are not doing that. We un-
derstand this is an extraordinary mo-
ment. And we may do something dif-
ferent if we are thinking about a long- 
term policy, but for the immediate 
term, let us do the right thing. Let us 
err on the side of helping working fam-
ilies who are out of work. That is why I would oppose this amendment if it is going to be offered 
by the Senator from Nebraska. I came 
to the floor to explain how we reached 
this point, and I hope that others will 
consider my point of view. Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Thank you. Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Nebraska. Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I would say very briefly that I appreciate the 
comments from the Senator from Illi-nois explaining his position. It seems to me that from where he started, he 
should actually be supporting the 
amendment, and then we should figure 
out what we need to do to push on the 
Department of Labor to actually mod-
ernize their systems. But I just want to say in public something that has been negotiated for 
the last 8 or 9 hoursŠand we haven™t 
been able to get conversation partners, 
really, on that side of the aisleŠwhich 
is that you are absolutely right that 
the Department of Labor says that 
there are massive system problems in 
the States. So given that we are enter-
ing a recession at this moment, we are 
going to have lots and lots of needy 
Americans, and the calls on the State 
departments for unemployment insur-
ance benefits are substantial right 
now. So I would just say, taking you in 
good faith that you would like to up-
grade these systems so that we could 
do this thing, which doesn™t acciden-
tally stimulate unemployment by 
disincentivizing work, I have been try-
ing all afternoon to get people on that 
side of the aisle to say: Hey, maybe we 
can™t get this solved by day one of the 
new unemployment insurance benefits, 
but by week 8 or 9, maybe we should 
have been able to get to a place where 
the Department of Labor had the re-
sources to help these departments of 
unemployment insurance deal with 
this. So I will follow up with you offline because I would like to work with you 
on trying to upgrade these systems. I have one more thing to say, but if you want to get in a word, please, go 
ahead. Mr. DURBIN. I would, in the nature of a question through the Chair, which 
I believe is the appropriate procedure. Mr. SASSE. The Presiding Officer is very liberal on these things. He is very 
easy. Mr. DURBIN. Well, this is actually turning out to be a debate on the floor 
of the Senate. It is almost historic. But I would just say this. We dis-agree on one basic premise. I don™t be-
lieve giving people $1,200 for each 
adult, as the President suggested, or 
out of our approach, if they ended up 
with a net gain of $2,000, that we have 
now turned them into lazy people who 
will not go back to work, and that they 
will just wait for the next government 
check. These aren™t the people I know, and they aren™t the people you know. By 
and large, these are hard-working peo-
ple who, with an additional $1,000, may 
finally be able to buy that refrigerator, 
may finally be able to get that car 
fixed, and may finally be able to get 
some dental work done. Mr. SASSE. I would reclaim my time pretty soon. Mr. DURBIN. So I don™t think paying them a little extra here is going to 
change their lifestyle and attitude to-ward hard work. Mr. SASSE. We were agreeing for a while, but I think it is pretty impor-
tant here to underscore that your math 
isn™t real. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00028Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.044S25MRPT1

S2049 March 25, 2020 The reality is that in lots and lots and lots of States in the country, 
where people are earning $12 or $13 or 
$14 or $15 an hour right now, the unem-
ployment option they are going to be 
offered is going to be more like $24 or 
$25 an hour. We are not talking about $1,000 over the course of these months. We are 
talking about cases where people might 
have an annualized wage right now of 
$30,000 and be looking at an unemploy-
ment benefit of $1,000 a week, which is 
$50,000 annualized. So your math isn™t 
real. The reality is, it isn™t $600 total. It is $600 on top of what the unemployment 
benefits already were in that State. So 
there are lots of people who are strug-
gling to work hard and to love their 
neighbor. We have a lot of health aides 
in Nebraska who make 16 bucks an 
hour. That is a $32,000-a-year job. Their 
work is important. That is a vocation. 
People need them. There are sick people from COVIDŒ19 and other diseases right now in Ne-
braska who need the benefit of those 
health aides, and you just told them in 
this billŠwe just told them in this 
billŠyeah, your work is a little bit im-
portant, but look at this. You could 
make substantially more money if you 
didn™t do the hard thing of trying to 
figure out what do we do with our kids 
today when school is closing, and I 
don™t know how to do daycare, and my 
sister agreed to help take care of my 
kids, but do I really put the burden on 
her when I don™t actually have to go to 
work to get this same money? In fact, 
I can get substantially more money by 
going on the unemployment insurance 
program. That is a disincentive to work that I don™t think you believe in, I know I 
don™t believe in, and I know nobody in 
my State believes in. It is not a Republican versus a Demo-cratic issue. This is an American issue. 
We believe in workers, and we believe 
in work, and we don™t believe govern-
ment should come in and say: It is 
much better off to be a nonworker than 
a worker. You can make a lot more 
money being a nonworker than a work-
er. We are not talking about people who suffered layoffs last week. We are talk-
ing about creating a system here which 
will incentivize more unemployment 
next week. That is a mistake by this 
Congress, and we could and we should 
be doing better than that tonight. I know the Senator from Texas has been trying to get in. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, this bill is going to pass overwhelmingly. It may 
pass unanimously tonight, but I think 
this amendment would make it sub-
stantially better. I expect we will see a 
party-line vote on this amendment, 
and I think that is unfortunate because 
the consequence of the systemŠthe un-
employment insurance systemŠin this bill right now is that we are going to substantially disincentivize work, and 
it is going to hurt workers. It is going 
to hurt small businesses. Let me give you a concrete example. In Texas right now, the maximum un-
employment insurance is $521 a week. 
After this bill passes, that will rise 
from $521 a week to $1,121 a week. That 
is nearly just over $58,000 a year. That 
means that, in the State of Texas, we 
are going to be paying people, offering 
them, basically, 28 bucks an hour not 
to work. Now, listen, every one of us recog-nizes that people are hurting. The 
problem is the incentive. We are cre-
ating an incentive that will hurt small 
businesses. If you have a waiter or a waitress who has lost their job for a few weeks, 
they are on unemployment, and they 
are making $25, $26, $28 an hour, sud-
denly, the prospect of going back to 
that job and seeing the money they are 
making going down substantially 
doesn™t seem too attractive. And, sud-
denly, the restaurant owner who is try-
ing to make the small business work 
can™t attract those workers back. That 
is bad for everyone. Incentives matter. 
We want people to work. So I would ask the Senator from Illi-nois: You said the problem with imple-
menting this principleŠthat we 
shouldn™t pay people more not to work 
than they make workingŠwas adminis-
trative, that the Department of Labor 
and the States couldn™t do it. Would 
the Senator agree with this amend-
ment, and would the Democratic Party 
agree with this amendment if it simply 
had language inserted ‚‚to the best ex-
tent practicable™™? So acknowledging that it may not be practicable, would you agree with the 
principle that in implementing this, 
the States and the Department of 
Labor should try to make sure we are 
not paying people more not to work 
than they would make if they were 
working? Mr. DURBIN. Is that a question di-rected to me through the Chair? Mr. CRUZ. I will yield to the Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. All right. Let me just say at the outset that we are talking 
about people who did not voluntarily 
leave their jobs. These people did not 
voluntarily leave their jobs. They were 
terminated. They were laid off. They 
were furloughed. These are not people 
who were gaming a system. These are 
people who are victims of the system 
that is hurt by this national emer-
gency. Secondly, if we are erring on the side of giving struggling, hard-working fam-
ilies an additional $1,000 a monthŠ 
$1,000 a monthŠfor goodness™ sake, I 
am not going to apologize for a mo-
ment. These people are living paycheck to paycheck, in many respects, if they are 
making $15 an hour. That is $30,000 a 
year. And for us to say: Well, they are 
going to end up with 1,000 bucks; now they will never go back to work, those people. I don™t believe that. In this world of social media and such, we have been contacted by nurses 
who say: So you think we are going to 
quit our jobs so that we can take ad-
vantage of the unemployment benefits? 
No, we go to our jobs, and we do what 
we have to do, and the amount of 
money is secondary. Mr. CRUZ. If I could reclaim my time? Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to, and I thank the Senator from Texas. But I 
would just say this: Yes, in this re-
spect, I agree with you. Take a look at the State systems of paying unemployment benefits. We are 
told by the U.S. Department of Labor 
that many of them are way behind the 
modern technology and cannot meet 
what you have stated as your goal 
here. If we want to work toward that goal of improving those State systems, as 
Senator SCOTTsaid earlier, I will join you in that effort. But let™s not apolo-
gize for, perhaps, sending them an 
extra $1,000. One last point, we are asking these people to stay home. We were asking 
them to help us defeat this virus by not 
working and to stay with their fami-
lies. So one of the incentives here, if 
there is a good unemployment benefit 
coming in, is that they can keep their 
families together while they obey this 
directive, at least, from government, 
State and Federal. Mr. CRUZ. These quarantines are going to end. The period of staying at 
home is going to end. But under the policy favored by the Democratic Sen-
ators, there is going to be an incentive 
that is going to end up with more peo-
ple being unemployed. Let™s say you are a restaurant. And if you keep your employees on, maybe 
through a small business loan, you can 
pay them, say, 10 bucks or 11 bucks or 
15 bucks an hour, whatever you are 
paying. But if you let them go, they 
can go on unemployment and make a 
whole lot more money. You don™t think 
there are going to be a lot of small 
business owners who have their em-
ployees saying: Wait a second, I can 
make more money? That is a bad incentive. We want to create incentives. I agree that people 
want to work, but government can 
mess that up if we make it more profit-
able. Look, the checks we are sending, the $1,200 a person, don™t create an incen-
tive. It is not $1,200 if you do x conduct. 
We want incentives that bring people 
back to work so that these small busi-
nesses that are closing their doors 
every day don™t stay closedŠso that 
they open up again, and that they have 
opportunity again. It is a perverse incentive to pay peo-ple more not to work than to work. 
Yes, we should help them, but we 
shouldn™t trap them. That is what this 
policy does. Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question? VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00029Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.046S25MRPT1

S2050 March 25, 2020 Mr. CRUZ. Of course. Mr. DURBIN. Senator, I am sure you are acutely aware that this is a 4- 
month program. We are not offering 
people this benefit indefinitely. I hope 
we don™t have to renew it, but to say 
that I am going to change my lifestyle 
and give up returning to the place 
where I have worked forever, where I 
was just laid off because they closed 
the restaurant because of a 4-month 
program, I don™t think so. I think people are more loyal to the workplace if they are treated fairly. 
And if we end up giving them an addi-
tional $1,000 a month, at the end of the 
day, I think it is the right thing to do. Mr. CRUZ. The incentives matter. We don™t want to delay a recovery from 
this crisis by 4 months. Hopefully, we 
stop this global pandemic, and we stop 
it soon. You don™t know how soon that 
will be. I don™t know. One of the benefits of this bill is that we are flooding more resourcesŠand we 
should beŠinto testing, into preventive 
gear, and into ventilators. There is a 
lot we need to do to stop this pan-
demic, but when it endsŠand it will 
end, and we will get through thisŠwe 
want people to go back to workŠnot 4 
months from now. We want them to go 
back to work as soon as they are able 
to go back to work, and that is what 
our economy needs to be strong. I would note, again, that I posed a question to the Senator from Illinois: 
Would he take a modification that ac-
knowledges the administrative prob-
lems but said that this is the principle 
we should followŠthat you shouldn™t 
be paid more not to work than you are 
paid to work. And the Senator from Il-
linois didn™t answer that. Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. CRUZ. Absolutely. Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator sup-port the Trump administration™s cash 
payment to these families, which 
comes to them whether they work or 
not? Mr. CRUZ. I do. I am going to vote for it, but it doesn™t create an incen-
tive. This is where too many in the 
Democratic Party don™t understand the 
incentives of trapping people out of 
work. Incentives are future looking. In sending these checks right now, if you 
make $75,000 or less, you are going to 
get a check in the mail in the next cou-
ple of weeks. That is helping relief, but 
it doesn™t create an incentive for con-
duct tomorrow. What I don™t want is 
for people to be sitting there making a 
choiceŠmaking a very rational choice. Look, if you are sitting there and saying, Well, gosh, I can make a lot 
more money staying at home with my 
kids and not working than if I go back 
to the job, that is not an irrational de-
cision if you are making 28 bucks an 
hour to stay home. We are causing that 
problem if we are incentivizing people 
not to work, and that is not, ulti-
mately, in their interest or in the 
economy™s interest. This is hurting workersŠto pay them more not to work than they would make if they 
were working. Mr. DURBIN. If I may just comment and say this. I don™t think President 
Trump™s cash payment or an additional 
$1,000 a month, or whatever it is, under 
the unemployment benefit is going to 
make a worker lazy and government 
dependent. These are not the people I 
know. These are people who get up and 
work hard every darn day, and if they 
get an extra helping hand out of this, 
so be it. We are trying to deal with a health crisis and help these families get 
through it. That is where we started on 
this side of the aisle. We may talk about something in the future and approach it a little dif-
ferently, but I don™t think it makes 
them lazy to receive the President™s 
cash payment or to receive an extra 
payment from this unemployment ben-
efit. Mr. CRUZ. So, with respect, the Sen-ator from Illinois is suggesting this is 
somehow some negative moral judg-
ment that it makes them lazy. It is ex-
actly the contrary. I am saying people 
behave according to rational incen-
tives. Look, our girls are 11 and 8 at home. We have incentives all the time: posi-
tive incentives and negative incen-
tives. Incentives work. We don™t want to create a system where someone, being perfectly ration-
al and reasonable, says: Well, gosh, I 
can make a lot more money for my 
family staying home than I can going 
to work. If I go to work, my family 
makes less money. That is not a ques-
tion of being lazy. That is a question of 
the government is putting me in a posi-
tion where, if I want to care for my 
kids, I can do a better job of that by 
staying home. That is really foolish, 
and that, unfortunately, is the position right now of what I expect to be the 
Democratic Senators who will vote no 
on this. That is a bad policy for workers. It is a bad policy for small businesses. It is 
a bad policy for the economy. We 
should support jobs, not paying people 
not to work. Give them a safety net, 
yes. Give them relief, yes. But don™t 
create incentives that make the prob-
lem worse, and that is what this Demo-
cratic policy will do. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Delaware spoke first and is 
recognized. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, replying to my colleagues, I think the Senators 
from Nebraska and South Carolina 
know that I have great affection and 
respect for themŠand I have from the 
day they got here. I used to be a State treasurer. I was elected at the tender age of 29. Dela-
ware had the worst credit rating in the 
country. We were dead last and 
couldn™t balance our budgets to save 
our souls, and we had pretty much no 
money in the unemployment insurance 
fund. Over time, we straightened out our finances, elected a guy named Pete du 
Pont as our Governor. I was treasurer 
for a while, and we had a Democratic 
and a Republican legislatureŠsplit. We 
learned how to work together. It is 
something we call ‚‚the Delaware way.™™ Later on, I got to be Governor, suc-ceeded not Pete du Pont but Mike Cas-
tle, who was his successor. I was very 
active in the National Governors Asso-
ciation. They even let me be chairman 
for a while. I was the lead Democratic 
Governor on welfare reform when I was 
a member of the National Governors 
Association. I was raised in a coal mining town in West Virginia. ParentsŠnot much 
money, deep faith, hard work. My dad 
used to say to my sister and me: I don™t 
care if you have to work three jobs to 
pay your bills, work three jobs. That is really the way I was raised, and I suspect that most of us here were 
raised that wayŠa strong work ethic. When I was involved as the lead Democratic Governor on welfare re-
form, I used to say people ought to be 
better off working than they are on 
welfare. Bill Clinton said that often. I 
really believe that. The thing that was wrong with wel-fareŠour welfare systemŠwas that 
people were actually better off staying 
home than they were working. So kind 
of the same principle we are talking 
about here. Every State has its own unemploy-ment insurance fund. We have one in 
Delaware. They have one in Nebraska, 
one in Texas, one in Illinois. They are 
different, and different benefits are cal-
culated in different States. I just got off the phone, colleagues, with a fellow named Cerron Cade, who 
used to be a member of my team when 
I was early in my time in the Senate. 
He is now secretary of labor. I said, CerronŠMr. SecretaryŠwhat do we pay people in Delaware on unem-
ployment insurance? What is the re-
placement rate? He said it is some-
where between 25 and 50 percent of 
what people were earning. But he said 
there is a $400 cap per monthŠexcuse 
meŠper week. There is a $400 cap per 
week on the benefits that we will pay 
anybody, regardless of what they were 
makingŠ$400 a week. If you think about it, $400 a week for 4 weeks is like $1,600 a month. Add to 
that the $600 benefit, and we are talk-
ing about $2,200 per month. If somebody is working full timeŠ Mr. SASSE. Six hundred per week. 
Mr. CARPER. Excuse me. There you go. But if you add the numbers, I am 
not sure we end up with $24 per hour in 
Delaware. Mr. SASSE. Twenty-six. 
Mr. CARPER. It might be the case, but I would have to see those numbers. My secretary of labor said he thought that the number that we were looking 
at here was something like $13 an hour 
in Delaware, when you add it all in, as 
opposed to 24. So we will go back to do 
our math. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00030Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.047S25MRPT1

S2051 March 25, 2020 Mr. SASSE. Will the Senator yield? Mr. CARPER. Happy to yield. 
Mr. SASSE. I don™t think that any of us think that a math debate is the 
most productive way to spend our time 
in the Senate, but just so we are all 
talking on the same song sheet: $400 a 
week, add $600, is $1,000 a week. Divided 
by a 40-hour week, that is $25 an hour. I don™t know how you explain that to people who are making 15, 16 bucks an 
hour in Delaware, that you are now 
going to pay them $25 if they become 
unemployed. The Senator from Illinois said this is the program only for people who are in-
voluntarily separated. If that is the 
way the program worked, it would be 
great, but anybody who has ever spent 
any time with unemployment insur-
ance programs in your States knows 
that is not how it works. How it actually works is, once you create a disincentive to work, employ-
ers regularly work with employees to 
say: I kind of would like to drive you 
off the system, and I think you should 
recognize this would be better for you, 
too, if you can casualize it. That is ac-
tually what happens. I will yield the floor back to the Sen-ator. Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator very much. I will go back and will re-
engage with our secretary and make 
sure we have the math right. The other point that he madeŠI asked him: How hard would it be to ad-
minister? Is it something we could 
stand up in a couple of weeks or are we 
talking about months or what? He said 
this would not be an easy thing, admin-
istratively, to do. And at a time where 
we are anxious to get the benefit out 
the door in a hurry, this would not be 
easy. I would just ask us to keep that 
in mind. One of the people I talked to last week when I was trying to figure out, 
really, what kind of big package legis-
lative package No. 3 should beŠLeon 
Panetta is one of the people I talked 
to. He told me about the three t™s: 
timely, targeted, and temporary. Those 
are the three that he talked about. Timely means making sure we figure or calculate the right benefit but that 
we are able to turn around and pay it 
in a timely way. What I gathered from my secretary of labor is we are not going to be able 
to incorporate what they are doing at 
the State level, feed into that the 
State and the Federal benefit, and do it 
in a timely way. I think, if we could do 
that, you would have, probably, a fair 
amount of bipartisan support. But it is 
that delay, and we just don™t know how 
long that delay would be. Ted Kennedy used to sit behind me when I first came to the Senate. And I 
noticed that I knew some Senators. 
DICKDURBINand I served in the House together, and other people, we had been 
Governors together. I didn™t know Ted 
Kennedy. One day I said to him: I am 
new here in the Senate, and I don™t 
really know you very well. What I was doing was going to have a cup of coffee with the Senators I didn™t 
know well, and I asked if I could maybe 
have a cup of coffee with him. He said: 
We will do better than that. Come to 
my hideaway, and we will have lunch 
together. I said: That is great. I didn™t think we ever would, but it was a nice offer, a nice idea. Two weeks 
later, we had lunch together in his 
hideaway. It was like a Kennedy mu-
seum. Some of you have been there be-
fore. It is an amazing place. I remember I asked him: How is it that so many Republicans here want 
you, Ted KennedyŠthe most liberal 
Democrat, maybe, we had at the timeŠ 
to be their lead cosponsor on their 
bills? Why is that? And he said: I am always willing to compromise on policy, never willing to 
compromise on principle. I think that the policy here is that, when people are unemployed and they 
need help, we want to help them, and 
we help them in a timely way. Mr. CRUZ. Will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. CARPER. I will just finish my thought, and then I would be happy to. But in a timely way. And I am just concernedŠmy second concern, along 
with my first concern: I am just con-
cerned that the idea to deal with this 
in a timely way is going to be dimin-
ished, maybe significantly. We just, 
honestly, don™t know. I am happy to yield. 
Mr. CRUZ. A question to the Senator. The Senator said that you were con-
cerned about implementation and that 
it may not be timely at the State level 
to implement this. I think, just prior to when you came to the floor, I suggested a possible 
amendment to the Senator from Ne-
braska™s amendment that would add a 
qualifier, something like, ‚‚to the best 
extent practical.™™ So it doesn™t slow 
the program down, but it acknowledges 
that both the Department of Labor and 
the States should endeavor to imple-
ment this in a way that ensures people 
don™t get paid more not to work than 
to work. So it adds a qualifier. You just sug-gested there might be bipartisan agree-
ment. Would the Senator from Dela-
ware be amenable to such a change? Mr. CARPER. I would be happy to discuss that with you and better under-
stand what you offer. I wasn™t here 
when you spoke. Thank you. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, for over 200 years, the American people have 
shown resilience in the face of great 
challenges. From civil wars, inter-
national conflicts, andŠyesŠ 
pandemics, we have faced these chal-
lenges united and with resolve. Like the challenges of the past, the novel coronavirus pandemic is a crisis 
that, together, we can and we will 
overcome. As the cases of COVIDŒ19 increase each day, my top priority is protecting the health and the safety of Michiganders and people all across this 
Nation. There is no doubt we are facing 
an unprecedented public health emer-gency and an economic crisis at the 
same time. Families in my State of MichiganŠ and Americans all across this coun-
tryŠare worried about their health and 
their safety and whether they are 
going to be able to make ends meet 
during this emergency. We must act 
quickly to provide relief for struggling 
families and small businesses and 
healthcare providers. And even as we 
move with the urgency that this dif-
ficult time demands, we must ensure 
that this bill is done right and that we 
are getting the right help to the people 
who need it the most. We must act ag-
gressively, and now we must do every-
thing to provide relief to workers and 
families in Michigan and across the 
country. Americans are facing an unprece-dented personal, health, and financial 
challenge. Workers in my home State 
of Michigan who are forced to stay 
home from work due to the coronavirus 
shouldn™t need to worry about whether 
they can pay their bills or put food on 
their table. That is why I authored legislation that is included in this package before 
the Senate to expand unemployment 
assistance. We have never had unem-
ployment benefits in response to a pub-
lic health crisis, but we have never 
seen an emergency on the scale of what 
we are seeing right now. We must sup-
port workers who are not receiving a 
paycheck or have been laid off due to 
coronavirus. That is why I fought to create an un-employment compensation program to 
provide federally funded benefits to 
people who are unable to work during 
this pandemic. It would expand unem-
ployment benefits to workers who have 
exhausted their State unemployment 
benefits, and it would make unemploy-
ment benefits available to people who 
don™t usually qualifyŠincluding small 
business owners, freelance writers and 
workers, independent contractors, sea-
sonal workers, and people who have re-
cently started or were about to start a 
new job. And it provides workers with ex-tended unemployment insurance so 
that hard-working families can have 
some certainty that they can stay 
afloat financially during this crisis 
that is likely to last awhile. Our small businesses have been hit especially hard, and some are at risk of 
having to close their doors or lay off 
their employees. Our small businesses 
are the backbone of our economy, and 
they need support now more than ever. 
That is why I worked with my col-
leagues on the Small Business Com-
mittee to craft legislation to expand 
funding available for small business 
loans. As a result of those efforts, this package now increases the funding for 
the popular and successful 7(a) small 
business loans to $350 billion. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00031Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.055S25MRPT1

S2052 March 25, 2020 I also pressed for additional fund-ingŠ$240 millionŠfor small business 
development centers and women™s busi-
ness centers and an increase in funding 
for minority business centers as well. 
These funds will go a long way toward 
helping small businesses pay their rent 
and keep their lights on. This legislation also includes signifi-cantly more funding that will go to our 
hospitals and healthcare system. This 
funding will ensure that our over-
stretched hospitals can make up for 
lost revenue, keep their doors open, 
and make payroll for the dedicated 
nurses, doctors, and healthcare profes-
sionals who are on the frontlines fight-
ing day in and day out to stop this pan-
demic. I have been working closely with the hospitals and healthcare providers in 
Michigan, and they cannot stress how 
critical this funding is to their ability 
to continue providing care and comfort 
during this pandemic. I will keep fight-
ing to ensure that they have the re-
sourcesŠthe supplies, the gloves, the 
masksŠand the medical equipment 
they need to protect themselves and 
their patients from coronavirus. Finally, as the ranking member of the Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs committee, I worked 
closely with Chairman RONJOHNSONto ensure that this legislation has strong 
oversight provisions in place. We must 
ensure that the funds we are author-
izing are going to the people, the small 
businesses, and the healthcare pro-
viders who need them the most. Our oversight provision creates a Pandemic Response Accountability 
CommitteeŠa Board that is made up of 
agency watchdogs who will be charged 
with auditing and investigating the ad-
ministration™s coronavirus response ef-
forts and how your hard-earned tax 
dollars are being used to address this 
serious crisis. We are also requiring the Govern-ment Accountability Office to audit 
where these funds are going and keep 
Congress and the American people up 
to date through real-time, publicly 
available reports. This model was used 
to successfully track spending from the 
2009 Recovery Act during the great re-
cession, and I was proud to work with 
my Republican chairman to get this 
important accountability measure in-
cluded in this bill. This bill is an important step forward to address this crisis head-on and en-
sure our Nation can get back on track 
once we have addressed the serious 
public health threat and the resulting 
economic crisis as well. It is an impor-
tant step, but it is not the last action 
we will need to take before this pan-
demic is over. I am going to do everything possible to continue working with my col-
leagues in a bipartisan manner to en-
sure Michigan communities and fami-
lies have the resources and the support 
they desperately need. I will also con-
tinue working closely with Michigan 
Governor Gretchen Whitmer, local leaders, public health experts, and na-tional security officials. It will continue to take each and every one of us doing our part and 
working together to prevent the spread 
of this pandemic, protect public health, 
and continue to address this economic 
crisis. But together, I know that we 
will get through this, and we will come 
out stronger on the other side. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SCOTTof South Carolina). The Senator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me be very honest and tell you that there 
is much in this billŠand we have not 
yet seen the printout yetŠthat I am 
concerned about. I am especially con-
cerned that the administration will be 
able to spend $500 billion in virtually 
any way they wantŠany corporation 
they wantŠwith virtually no strings 
attached. The American people, at a time of massive income and wealth and in-
equality, do not want more corporate 
welfare, and they do not want policies 
that will allow corporations in some 
cases to receive loans or grants and 
then do stock buybacks to enrich their 
stockholders, provide dividends, or 
maybe raise the compensation benefits 
of their already wealthy CEOs. What the American people want right now is for us to use our taxpayer dol-
lars in every way we can to protect the 
working families of this country, to 
protect the middle class, to protect the 
50 percent of our people who are living 
paycheck to paycheck. As we speak tonight, half of our peo-ple in this countryŠin the richest 
country in the history of the worldŠ 
are living paycheck to paycheck. They 
wake up in the morning, and they are 
saying: Do you know what? I can bare-
ly make it on the paycheck I got be-
cause I am making 12, 13, 14 bucks an 
hour, and now that paycheck has 
stopped. How am I going to pay my 
rent? How am I going to put food on 
the table for my kids? How am I going 
to make sure the lights remain on? 
How am I going to pay my student 
debt? How am I going to pay my credit 
card debt? If somebody in the family 
gets sick, how am I going to pay for 
that? This bill has been worked on exten-sively in the last few days. There are 
elements in it that, in my view, are 
positiveŠdon™t go far enough by any 
meansŠbut one of the things this bill 
does do is provide the largest expansion 
of unemployment benefits in history, 
expending about $250 billion of Federal 
funds. What it does, importantly, is the 
bill understands that for all kinds of 
absurd reasons having to do with the 
Republican attacks on workers for 
many years, fewer than 50 percent of 
American workers today are eligible 
for unemployment benefits. What this bill does, rightly so, is say that in the midst of this terrible eco-
nomic crisis where some peopleŠno-
body knowsŠwhere some economists are estimating that by June, the end of next quarter, unemployment could be 
20 percent or 30 percentŠand what this 
bill does say is that whether or not you 
are eligible for unemployment today, 
you are going to get unemployment 
compensation. And that means many 
of the gig workersŠpeople who drive 
Uber carsŠmany of the waitresses and 
waiters who make starvation minimum 
wages, many so-called independent 
contractors will be eligible for the ex-
tended unemployment benefits. And 
that is exactly the right thing. The other thing this bill does, which is right, is say: OK, we are in the midst 
of a horrific crisis, unprecedented in 
modern American history. Not only are 
you going to get your regular unem-
ployment benefits, we are going to add 
another $600 a week to it. And now I find that some of my Re-publican colleagues are very distressed. 
They are very upset that somebody 
who is making 10, 12 bucks an hour 
might end up with a paycheck for 4 
months that is more than they re-
ceived last week. Oh, my God, the uni-
verse is collapsing. Imagine that. 
Somebody who is making 12 bucks an 
hour now faces, like the rest of us, an 
unprecedented economic crisis and, 
with the 600 bucks on top of their reg-
ular unemployment check, might be 
making a few bucks more for 4 months. 
Oh, my word, will the universe survive? 
How absurd and wrong is that? What 
kind of value system is that? Meanwhile, these very same folks had no problem a couple of years ago 
voting for $1 trillion in tax breaks for 
billionaires and large, profitable cor-
porationsŠnot a problem. But when it 
comes to low-income workers in the 
midst of a terrible crisis, maybe some 
of them earning or having more money 
than they previously madeŠoh, my 
word, we have to strip that out. By the way, when the MCCONNELL bill first came up, unbelievablyŠand I 
know many Republicans objected to 
thisŠthey were saying that we want to 
giveŠwhatever it wasŠ1,000 or 1,200 
bucks, but poor people should get less. 
You said: Because poor people are down 
here, they don™t deserveŠthey don™t 
eat; they don™t pay rent; they don™t go 
to the doctor; they are somehow infe-
rior. Because they are poor, we are 
going to give them less. That was ad-
dressed. Now everybody is going to get 
the $1,200. Some of my Republican friends have not given up the need to punish the 
poor and working people. You haven™t 
raised the minimum wage in 10 years. 
Minimum wage should be at least 15 
bucks an hour. You haven™t done that. 
You have cut program after program 
after program, and nowŠhorror of hor-
rorsŠfor 4 months, workers might be 
earning a few bucks more than they 
otherwise would. Needless to say, this is an amend-ment that is coming up, but I don™t 
think it is going to go very far. If it VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00032Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.049S25MRPT1
dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDŠSENATE
S2053 March 25, 2020 does go far, I will introduce an amend-ment to deal with the corporate wel-
fareŠthe $500 billion in corporate wel-
fareŠwhich is, to me, a very serious 
problem. But I do not think they are 
going to get the 60 votes, and that will 
be the end of it. This bill also includes some $250 bil-lion in one-time checks of $1,200 for 
adults and $500 for kids. I have a couple 
of concerns there. No. 1, I believe that 
in the midst of this unprecedented cri-
sis we should make this a monthly ben-
efit, not a one-time benefit. Depending 
on what happensŠand I expect very 
much that this Congress will be recon-
vening because I think this coronavirus 
3Šthe bill we are on right nowŠis 
going to be superseded by coronavirus 
4. My strong guess is this does not go 
far enough. But the bill does include a 
$1,200 check for adults, $500 for kids. 
That will in the short term. We have to 
do a lot better than that. As many of you know, in countries around the worldŠUK, Denmark, other 
countriesŠthe approach they are tak-
ing, which makes sense to me, is to ba-
sically say to employers: If you keep 
your workers on the job, even if they 
are not working right now, we will pay. 
The UK pays 80 percent of their salary; 
other countries are a bit higher. I 
think that is the direction we should 
have gone. This is a little bit more con-
voluted. What we do here is give $367 
billion in loans to small businesses, 
and those loans could be forgiven if 
those small businesses don™t lay off 
workers. I think, for a variety of rea-
sons, that is exactly the right thing to 
do. The goal right now is to stabilize the economy by telling workers that they 
will have their jobs when they come 
back, when this thing is over, and in 
the meantime, they will have all or 
most of their income. That is my pre-
ferred approach. This bill provides $150 billion to States and cities. I can tell you that in 
VermontŠand I am sure in every other 
State in this country, States and cities 
are hurting because we all know there 
has been a major decline in tax rev-
enue. That is an important thing do. By the way, in the midst of this cri-sis, a lot of the responsibility is going 
to fall on local and State government. 
One of the concerns, of many, that I 
have about this bill is that in the best 
of times, this bill requires an enormous 
amount of work by the Federal, State, 
and local governments. How do you get 
all these unemployment checks out? 
How do you deal with all of these small 
businesses that may apply for these 
loans? This is hard stuff. It becomes 
even more difficult when so many 
workers who work for local and State 
governments are not coming into work 
because of the coronavirus. One of the issues we are going to have to focus on big time is the imple-
mentation. If anyone thinks, just pass-
ing this bill, that tomorrow everything 
is going to flow smoothly, you are 
sadly mistaken. This is a complicated, multifaceted bill, and it is going to take an enormous amount of work to 
make sure that the money goes where 
it should go in a cost-effective way. This bill does a lot of other things, as well, that I think will help the Amer-
ican economy. To conclude, this is not the bill I would have written. Frankly, I don™t 
think it is the bill most Americans 
would have written. I think most 
Americans are very apprehensive that 
one-quarter of this bill is going to go to 
large corporations with very little ac-
countability. In a political season, let me make the radical suggestion that we have a 
President of the United States who 
may end up targeting some of this 
money to States that he needs to win. This bill has some good things. It has some issues of real concern. One thing 
we must not do is to punish low-income 
workers who might get a few bucks 
more than they had previously earned. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Nebraska. Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I just lis-tened to the speech by the Senator 
from Vermont. There is obviously a lot 
we don™t agree on in life and policy, 
politics, and economics. He caricatured 
the entire purpose of this amendment 
tonight. The purpose of this amend-
ment is to affirm work. Under his vision, I don™t know ex-actly where he thinks the workers who 
stock shelves and drive trucks right 
now would come from because he made 
an argument about government sub-
sidies that would be, on a permanent 
basis, higher than the wages of all 
those jobs. I don™t understand how his 
economic system would ever actually 
work. But I would like to praise him here. Two things: One, he said something 
that politicians usually don™t say. Usu-
ally when people say they will vote for 
something, they say the bill is salvific 
and utopian and going to do everything 
right, and if they are going to vote 
against something, they say it is the 
worst thing that has ever been written. 
Senator SANDERSjust said that this bill has a lot in it. It is big. It is 
clunky. We are in the middle of a na-
tional emergency. There is some good 
in it; there is some bad in it; and he is going to vote for it. I also believe this bill is big and clunky and stinky. There is a lot that 
is broken in it. There is some that is 
good and necessary and important. 
There is a lot that is bad and poorly 
thought out and not going to be imple-
mented very effectively. On that, I am 
also inclined to vote for it. So I appre-
ciate his candor in his admitting that 
this is kind of a big ‚‚crap sandwich.™™ In addition, I praise the Senator from Vermont for his candor in saying some-
thing that I totally oppose, but I appre-
ciate his integrity and honesty in ad-
mitting it. He said, I believeŠcorrect 
me if I am wrong, sirŠhe wishes the 
$1,200 emergency payment would be 
made monthly and permanently; is 
that right? Mr. SANDERS. No, not permanently but during the crisis, yes. Mr. SASSE. OK. That is a helpful clarification. The Senator was saying a lot of dif-ferent things, and I thought he was ar-
guing for a UPI of 14 grand. I just want-
ed to clarify that point. The Senator believes a lot of things very differently than I do, but I appre-
ciate the fact that he argues forcefully 
for his positions. I think this body 
would benefit from having more people 
who spoke as bluntly and directly as 
the Senator from Vermont. I hope his 
positions will be voted down again and 
again and again and again, but I appre-
ciate the way in which he argues for 
his positions. I thank the Presiding Officer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, several Senators on the other side have been 
arguing against the provision in this 
bill to supercharge unemployment in-
surance right now, which is something 
on which Senate Democrats have nego-
tiated with the Trump administration, 
Secretary Mnuchin, and Chairman 
GRASSLEY. Based on what I am hearing from the Senators on the other side, 
you would think that this provision 
was pretty much going to end Western 
civilization. Now, supercharging unemployment benefits has long been a priority for 
Senate Democrats, and we have been 
fighting for those improvements in un-
employment since the process began. 
In our view, it is the key to getting 
help to where it is needed the most. Believe me, colleagues, when you see the unemployment claim numbers to-
morrow, if the numbers are accurate, 
this Chamber is going to see that the 
unemployment crisis will be exploding 
in America. I don™t believe anybody in our great country should fall into destitution as 
a result of this pandemic, so I, obvi-
ously, disagree with my colleagues who 
oppose so strongly our amendment to 
improve unemployment benefits. I just 
want to make a few key points in re-
sponse to their argument. First, I start with an argument that just about knocked the wind out of me 
when I heard it earlier. It is the idea 
that nurses are going to quit their jobs 
as a result of this legislation. Nurses are not going to be quitting their jobs to get unemployment bene-
fits because that is not how nurses 
think when they get up in the morning. 
By now, everyone has seen the Hercu-
lean efforts of our nurses who have 
been fighting the pandemic. Nurses in 
America are brave, and they care. They 
are true professionals. From Portland, 
OR, to Portland, ME, they are on the 
frontlines of this fight and are putting 
themselves in harm™s way to save the 
lives of our neighbors whether they be 
in South Carolina, Oregon, or any-
where else. They don™t cut and run. 
Also, contrary to the suggestion of my 
colleague from Nebraska, retired VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00033Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.050S25MRPT1

S2054 March 25, 2020 nurses have been coming out of retire-ment in droves to help treat patients 
who are suffering because of the 
coronavirus. Second, it is a head-scratcher to me that my colleague from Nebraska is 
raising this objection now. I am the 
ranking Democrat on the Committee 
on Finance. I learned about his objec-
tion when I watched his press con-
ference, and then I called him about it. 
The proposal has been out there for 
days, and Senators have known about 
it the whole time. It is not a drafting 
error, and it is not a last-minute sur-
prise. What the Senator from Nebraska 
wants to drop now, in effect, was part 
of the bill. The Presiding Officer is a member of our committee, and I enjoy working 
with him. What the Senator from Ne-
braska wants to drop now was, in fact, 
part of the bill that Republican Leader 
MCCONNELLintroduced on Saturday. He introduced it on Saturday because 
the Senate Democrats insisted on its 
being part of the package, and as Sec-
retary Mnuchin said this afternoon on 
national televisionŠwe all heard itŠ 
the Republicans agreed. I will have a 
little more to say about Secretary 
Mnuchin™s remarks in a minute. Third, I want to talk about why this is so neededŠwhy my Democratic col-
leagues and I have worked so hard to 
help the millions get through these 
horrendous times who have been hit by 
this economic wrecking ball. For most Americans, the old unem-ployment rules would cover only a 
third to a half of their lost wages. That 
was it. It is pretty hard to pay the rent 
and put food on the table with that. 
Even before this crisis, the Federal Re-
serve found that nearly half of Ameri-
cans wouldn™t have been able to have 
come up with $400 cash to cover costs 
in an emergency. Let™s face it. Millions 
of Americans were walking on an eco-
nomic tightrope of balancing their rent 
against the food and the food against 
the fuel, and that was before the pan-
demic. That is why we on our side feel so strongly and are so appreciative of the 
work of Senator PETERSand Senator MENENDEZ, who helped in the negotia-tions, and, of course, of the leader™s 
work. We all said we need an improved, 
supercharged unemployment benefit to 
replace people™s lost wages. These are 
people who shouldn™t face a choice be-
tween homelessness and hunger or 
bankruptcy because a virus has shut 
down our economy and cost them their 
jobs. This isn™t the fault of any work-
ers in South Carolina or in Oregon or 
anywhere else. While the consumer economy is shut-tered, Congress has a responsibility to 
make sure that Americans can bounce 
back in a matter of weeks or months. 
Otherwise, millions will struggle and 
be slow to recover from the economic 
crisis, and many might not make it if 
the Senate doesn™t move to help them 
now, now, now. The panic people feel 
over the virus is already too much, and the least we can do as lawmakers is to have their backs when it comes to 
their surviving this economic crisis. All of my colleagues know we are on the third bill in the fight against the 
virus. MITCHMCCONNELL™s first version of this bill did virtually nothing for 
those who lost their jobs. I read it care-
fully. Out of 247 pages in the Repub-
lican leader™s first bill, only 8 lines of 
textŠnot 8 pages but 8 linesŠdealt 
with filing for unemployment online. 
That bill had an awful lot of corporate 
goodies and lots of slush funds for big 
corporations but just a few measly 
lines for people who were hurtingŠfor 
workers who were hurting, for workers 
who were losing their jobs. The Senate Democrats fought for and won the changes that make up this ro-
bust, expanding, supercharged program 
of unemployment insurance. It is based 
on a bill that I and our colleague Sen-
ator PETERSintroduced not long ago. First, in these punishing economic times, Americans are going to need 
more weeks of coverage than they 
would otherwise get from unemploy-
ment insurance. The existing length of 
unemployment benefits will not cover 
the time this crisis will last. Second, the Senate needs to mod-ernize the unemployment insurance 
program because it really hasn™t 
changed much since it was developed in 
Wisconsin in 1932, and, in 1932, nobody 
was talking about gig workers. The un-
employment program that was in-
vented then has not changed all that 
much. It certainly wasn™t built to take 
on the kind of challenge our country 
faces right now. The Democratic Senators and I looked at that system and said this old 
system wouldn™t be good enough for 
independent contractors, the self-em-
ployed, gig workers, part-time workers, 
and freelancers who are a big part of 
the face of the modern economy. They 
are not the kind of workers anybody 
was thinking about in 1932, when the 
program was invented. The Senate 
Democrats led the effort to get those 
people coverage. I am glad that, at one 
point in the negotiations, we could get 
bipartisan support for it. For the people who still have their jobs but who have had their hours 
slashed, we are going to bat for them. 
For the people in the service economy, 
who are those in the restaurants, sa-
lons, gymsŠyou name itŠall of those 
people who are suffering because their 
jobs and their businesses have been put 
on pauseŠwe are going to bat for them. 
We are talking about millions and mil-
lions of AmericansŠpeople who are 
looking at hard times ahead and who 
need our help now. The old unemployment insurance system wasn™t working, so the Senate 
Democrats said: We are going to come 
together, and we are going to go to bat 
for all of those independent contrac-
tors, those who are self-employed, the 
freelancers, and the gig workers. Now I think that not only are we going to help them over the next 4 months, but I think we have developed some ideas that can be part of reform-
ing the unemployment compensation 
system after those 4 months. Now I want to turn to why this agreement raises benefits specifically 
by $600 per week. I have heard my col-
leagues and their strenuous objections to that amount. The reason it is $600 is 
because Labor Secretary Scalia, after 
meeting with the Senate negotiatorsŠ 
myself, Senator GRASSLEY, Secretary Mnuchin, Senator MENENDEZ, Senator PORTMAN; a big group of usŠSecretary Scalia, after meeting with Senate ne-
gotiators, left us with no other way to 
get benefits to workers quickly. Sec-
retary Scalia said that the States had 
no other way to get the benefits to 
workers in time. We needed a simple solution. And I know my colleague, the distinguished 
President of the Senate, and others 
who are sponsoring this proposal to un-
ravel what Senate Democrats did with 
Secretary Mnuchin, the Trump admin-
istration, and Chairman GRASSLEYmay not believe me, but I want to share the 
words of Secretary Mnuchin himself, 
and specifically on this question of why 
we were focused on making sure that 
workers could get that extra $600 a 
week. Just today, Secretary Mnuchin said: Most of these state systems have tech-nology that is 30 years old or older. If we had 
the ability to customize this with much 
more specifics, we would have. This was the 
only way we could ensure states could get 
the money out quickly and in a fair way so 
we used 600 dollars across the board. I don™t 
think it will create incentives, most Ameri-
cans want what they want: they want to 
keep their jobs. That is what Secretary Mnuchin said today in defending the language that is 
in the bill as, in effect, the fastest, sim-
plest way for workers to get their bene-
fits and why we disagree so strongly 
with the amendment from the Senator 
from Nebraska to unravel that ap-
proach. The math shows that standard pay-ment of $600 is the simplest way to get 
to full wage replacement without caus-
ing, as of now, an administrative train 
wreck. So I am going to close on this. I am sure that everybody here read that un-
employment claims are expected to go 
up by 2.5 million in 1 week when the 
statistics are released tomorrow. Let 
me say that againŠ2.5 million. That is 
almost as many jobs that were lost in 
the entire year of 2008 when the great 
recession hit our country so hard. It is 
the single largest rise in unemploy-
ment since that figure began to be 
tracked. Twelve entire months™ worth 
of great recession job lossesŠthat is 
how many unemployment claims 
economists expect to see in a single 
week. This country has never faced any-thing like it. It is not a normal reces-
sion. This isn™t a normal bill to try to 
stimulate the economy in which the 
government tries to give the economy 
a shot of fiscal adrenaline. This is a VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00034Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.053S25MRPT1

S2055 March 25, 2020 time when we face a shutdown of entire sectors of our economy. What the Con-
gress needs to do is keep our economy 
alive and act now. We are not going to 
do that by shortchanging workers who 
are losing jobs, losing hours, or losing 
gigs. I feel so strongly that Americans want to work. Businesses want to keep 
their employees on the job. Americans 
want the economy to spring back to 
life once the pandemic is under con-
trol, and that is what supercharging 
unemployment benefits is all about. So here is the bottom line on the pro-vision that Senate Democrats agreed 
with the Trump administration, Sec-
retary Mnuchin, and Chairman GRASS-LEYonŠour proposal was not a draft-ing error. It didn™t pop out at the last 
minute. It is not going to bring about 
the end of Western civilization. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will review what Sec-
retary Mnuchin had to say this after-
noon on national television, supporting 
what Senate Democrats negotiated 
with him and the administration, and 
join us in making sure millions and 
millions of Americans don™t fall into 
destitution. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, America is at an inflection point. We are facing 
a public health crisis unlike any we 
have seen in generations. Governments 
at every level are racing to respond, 
react, and mitigate the crisis. Communities and counties are fearful their hospital systems will be overrun, 
and needed supplies are unavailable. 
States are struggling to support local 
and state-wide economies that are in-
creasingly hit with store closures and 
business suspensions. Unfortunately, 
the Federal GovernmentŠstarting with 
the PresidentŠhas failed to offer clear 
leadership to navigate this crisis. But today marks a turning point, thanks to the leadership the Senate 
will show by acting on this bipartisan 
emergency relief packageŠtoday, with-
out delay, and without hesitation. The package before us includes three important pillars. First, it directs eco-
nomic assistance for businesses and 
workers. Second, it provides emergency 
funding to support our over taxed med-
ical system, which is bracing for a 
surge in patients as the coronavirus 
continues to spread. And finally, it pro-
vides critical oversight to ensure that 
the funding Congress provides goes to 
the people who need itŠnot to line the 
pockets of corporations and executives 
who continue to benefit from the most 
generous tax cut in history. We will provide a massive investment in the unemployment insurance pro-
gram, ensuring that unemployed work-
ers can receive a maximum benefit in 
this time of economic crisis. These re-
forms will also extend unemployment 
insurance eligibility for an additional 
13 weeks and will allow part-time, self- 
employed, and gig economy workersŠ who are being hit hard in this crisisŠ to access benefits. Importantly, for 
Americans living paycheck to pay-
check, this bill will deliver these bene-
fits to workers sooner. To help the 
small businesses struggling to keep 
their doors open, to find a path to re-
open on the other end of this pandemic, 
this bill supports loan forgiveness to 
small businesses and some nonprofits, 
and provides critical funding to sup-
port payments of existing loans to 
small businesses through the Small 
Business Administration. The bill provides $340 billion in emer-gency appropriations to give new re-
sources to help strained State, local, 
and tribal governments as they combat 
this pandemic. These resources support 
hospitals and health care workers on 
the front lines of this public health cri-
sis. They fund the purchase of personal 
protective equipment and much needed 
medical equipment. The bill supports 
our law enforcement and first respond-
ers; funding for scientists researching 
treatments and vaccines; support for 
small businesses; support for local 
schools and universities; and funding 
for affordable housing and homeless-
ness assistance programs. The bill will 
provide immediate relief to farmers in 
Vermont and across the country who 
continue to feed our communities dur-
ing this emergency, with an emphasis 
on those farmers serving our local food 
systems. Importantly, the bill will not 
permit the transfer of emergency fund-
ing to battle COVIDŒ19 to the Presi-
dent™s misguided projects including the 
border wall. On top of all this, the bill includes a $150 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund 
that will provide State local, and Trib-
al government with additional re-
sources to address this pandemic, all 
with an important small State min-
imum to help states like Vermont. I think of our own Governor, Repub-lican Governor, who has worked so 
hard to help our State. This will give 
him some tools, as it will to our Speak-
er of the House and our President pro 
tempore of our legislature. In Vermont, Governor Scott has made the difficult but prudent decision 
to restrict statewide activities only to 
essential services, we, too, are feeling 
the impact of the coronavirus. With 
over 120 confirmed cases, our small 
State is already reeling from the eco-
nomic effects. I am pleased that the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund will support 
States and that it includes an impor-
tant small State minimum that will 
have significant impact in Vermont. Through formula grant funding, States will benefit from this package. 
In Vermont, that will mean $5.4 million 
through the CDC™s Public Health Emer-
gency Preparedness program; $4.2 mil-
lion for assistance through the Com-
munity Development Block Grant pro-
gram; nearly $20 million for public 
transportation emergency relief; $4.3 
million to provide child care assistance 
to those on the frontline of the 
coronavirus response, including health care workers and first responders; $4.6 million for housing assistance grants; 
$9.6 million to support the State™s air-
ports; $4 million in LIHEAP assistance; 
$5 million in Community Services 
Block Grant funding; $2 million in 
Byrne-JAG assistance to law enforce-
ment; and $3 million in election secu-
rity assistance grants. Finally, this bill includes important oversight and accountability measures 
that will require this administration to 
report publicly to the American people. 
This is a taxpayer-funded relief bill. 
The Executive Branch must be ac-
countable to those taxpayers. Finan-
cial relief to address the coronavirus 
pandemic should not be turned into a 
slush fund for a president seeking re-
election, with little accountability to 
the people whose money he is spending. I urge the Senate to pass this bill today, and I hope the House will swift-
ly follow. This is an emergency relief 
bill. Congress will need to take further 
action to provide needed stimulus to 
our State and local economies, to sup-
port our schools, including institutions 
of higher education, and to support dis-
placed workers who are the fabric of 
our national workforce. But with this bill, we provide support to the victims of this terrible virus: the 
healthcare providers and first respond-
ers on the frontlines, the essential 
workers who are keeping our store 
shelves stocked and the necessities 
available, and the families hit by the 
fallout from this pandemic. I have been fortunate. I have been married now for almost 58 years to one 
of the best medical surgical nurses I 
have ever known. I hear her tell it like 
what it is. Marcelle tells me what the 
doctors and nurses face in a situation 
like this. I pray that neither you nor I, 
nor any other Member of this body will 
have to face what they face on the 
frontlines of a crisis like this one. We 
should go forward and pass this bill and 
do that today. We must all heed the call of the med-ical professionals and experts calling 
for dramatic but essential action to 
stop the spread of this virus. That re-
quires leadershipŠfrom this Chamber 
and from the President of the United 
States. The eyes of the Nation will 
watch how we further manage this cri-
sis. Now is not the time to waiver in 
our resolve to do what is in the best in-
terest of the citizens whose interests 
we are sworn to protect. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

S2056 March 25, 2020 like to go first, I would want to give him that opportunity. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I am grateful. I thank the Senator from 
Maine, but I am happy to have her go 
first. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, all across the country, Americans are 
stepping up in response to the 
coronavirus pandemic sweeping our Na-
tion. Doctors and nurses are working 
endless hours and putting themselves 
at risk to care for the surge in pa-
tients. Manufacturers, including many 
companies in my State, are working 
overtime and retooling their product 
lines to produce medical testing swabs, 
ventilators, and personal protective 
equipment, all of which are vitally 
needed. Truckers are going above and 
beyond, missing time with their fami-
lies so that they can deliver goods 
needed to restock depleted grocery 
shelves. People are looking out for 
their neighbors in a safe way. They are 
checking on them. They are making 
personal sacrifices to help prevent the 
virus from spreading to the most vul-
nerable members of our society. Help is on the horizon for small busi-nesses and their employees who are 
facing economic devastation through 
no fault of their own. I have talked to small business own-ers all across our State, including 
small mom-and-pop operations like a 
third-generation diner operated and 
owned by the Simones family in Lewis-
ton, ME. For the first time ever in 
three generations, they have had to 
close their doors. They had no choice. 
As Linda Simones told me in tears ear-
lier this week: We have never been un-
employed. Our son is unemployed. Our 
friends who have worked with us at 
this diner for years are unemployed. The agreement finally reached today includes a $377 billion small business 
economic relief plan that Senators 
RUBIO, CARDIN, SHAHEEN, and I au-thored as members of the Small Busi-
ness Task Force. It is intended to help 
workers and small businesses just like 
the one owned by the Simones family 
in Lewiston. Our group worked day and 
night to get this bipartisan package in-
cluded in the broader legislation. I want to do a shout-out to our staff because I don™t think they have been to 
bed before 4 a.m. in the morning on any 
day in the last week. That is how hard 
they have worked too. Under our bipartisan approach, small businesses would be eligible for a 100- 
percent federally guaranteed emer-
gency loan to cover 8 weeks of payroll, 
as well as certain expenses like rent, 
mortgage payments, and utilities. If 
these businesses keep their employees 
on the payrollŠin other words, they 
keep issuing those paychecksŠtheir 
loans would be completely forgiven. Here is how it would work. Small em-ployers with 500 employees or fewer 
would be eligible to apply for these fed-
erally guaranteed loans. The loans 
would be available immediately 
through existing Small Business Ad-ministration-certified lenders, includ-ing certain banks, credit unions, and 
other financial institutions, and a 
streamlined process would be created 
to bring other additional lenders into 
the program. The size of the loans would be tied to a formula based on the small business™s 
average monthly payroll, and that 
would go back to February 15 since 
that is when the coronavirus really 
started to come to our country and 
have an impact. The maximum loan amount would be $10 million. As long as these small 
businesses retain their employees and 
issue those paychecksŠwhich, keep in 
mind, also means in many cases that 
those employees will get their health 
insurance as wellŠthe portion of the 
loan used to cover payroll and mort-
gage interest, rent, and utility pay-
ments would also be forgiven. FurthermoreŠand this is important to States like those of the Presiding 
Officer™s and mine that have large 
numbers of tourists coming each yearŠ 
employers with tipped employees 
would receive forgiveness for the addi-
tional wages paid to such employees. In addition, I want to point out that workers who already lost their jobs due 
to this crisis can be rehired and paid 
under our program, and that should be 
our goal. Mr. President, this vital assistance cannot come a moment too soon. There 
are so many small businesses that have 
already shut down or are on the verge 
of doing so. They are trying to hang on 
just a little longer to avoid laying off 
their employees, who are like members 
of their own family. In fact, in many 
cases, they were members of their own 
family. Without this package, we face an un-employment tsunami that could reach 
as high as 20 percent, according to the 
Secretary of the Treasury. Not only 
would this cause tremendous harm to 
millions of families, but it would also 
take a massive toll on the Federal 
budget, far exceeding the $377 billion 
that we are using for this small busi-
ness assistance program to keep work-
ers paid and employed. What we want is to make sure that those small businesses survive, that 
they are here when we transcend this 
crisis, and that their employees are 
still able to go back to work for them. 
We don™t want to break that link, that 
connection. We don™t want those small 
businesses to give up and shutter their 
doors forever, decimating our down-
towns and causing permanent job loss 
for the workers who are so much a part 
of their business. Larger businesses that are facing cash flow issues would be eligible for 
certain loans so they can avoid laying 
off their workers. However, unlike the 
small business assistance program, 
where they would have their loans for-
given as long as they keep their work-
ers employed, the larger businesses 
would be required to repay these loans 
in full. I want to make clear that these large businesses would be barred from stock 
buybacks and increasing executive pay 
for the duration of the loan, and I fully 
support those restrictions. Of course, many of those small busi-nesses don™t have shareholders, so the 
idea of a stock buyback doesn™t exist. 
Some of them that are subchapter S 
may, but many of them do not. I am also pleased to say that we would cover the sole proprietor, the 
independent contractorŠthose many 
individuals whom we rely upon to 
make our economy work. Following my advocacy, along with Members from other coastal States, I 
am also pleased that the bill includes 
$300 million to assist workers and busi-
nesses in our Nation™s fisheries, which 
support thousands of jobs in the great 
State of Maine. With this legislation, 
harvesters, fishing communities, agri-
culture operations, and other fishery- 
related businesses would be eligible for 
this $300 million in assistance, which 
may include some direct relief pay-
ments. This helps protect our food sup-
ply chain. This targeted relief will help 
ensure that the families in coastal 
communities who depend on our fish-
eries can emerge from this crisis. Simi-
lar assistance is provided to our farm-
ers as well. This bill also provides more than $30 billion for States, school districts, col-
leges, and universities to help them 
meet the unexpected expenses that 
have flowed from the coronavirus cri-
sis. Our KŒ12 schools will have access 
to $13.5 billion, which will help them 
support remote learning and meeting 
the needs of their students. I want to take a moment to recognize the dedication of those teachers, ad-
ministrators, school food-service work-
ers, and bus drivers who are not only 
making sure that students have access 
to remote learning but are making sure 
that students have access to meals off-
site. This bill provides funding to help 
them provide those meals in creative 
but, unfortunately, more costly ways, 
such as delivering prepackaged meals 
along bus routes or directly to students 
in their homes so that they won™t be 
hungry. We all know how important 
the School Breakfast and School Lunch 
Programs are to our low-income fami-
lies. When colleges and universities made the very tough decision to send stu-
dents home for the semester, I spoke 
with several presidents in Maine, and 
they told me about the steps they were 
taking to make sure that their stu-
dents could still receive a quality edu-
cation, albeit online or remotely. They 
were also taking stepsŠas well they 
shouldŠto reimburse students and 
their families for room and board and 
for shortened travel study programs. 
They are investing in the software and 
hardware infrastructures to bring 
classes online quickly. They are doing 
even more than that. The University of 
Maine, for example, has partnered with 
the State to prepare its dorms and its VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00036Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.058S25MRPT1

S2057 March 25, 2020 facilities for emergency uses, if nec-essary. So the direct aid to colleges and uni-versities is needed to help these insti-
tutions offset these sudden revenue 
losses and unexpected costs. There is 
also temporary flexibility applied to 
student aid and to student loans that 
also will be very helpful. This agreement is not only a lifeline for workers, small businesses, and 
schools, it builds on the previous two 
packages that Congress has passed to 
promote the health and safety of Amer-
icans. It makes substantial investment in our Nation™s health system, biomedical 
research, and education, including a 
$130 billion infusion for our hospitals 
and healthcare providers who are 
struggling to cope with this influx of 
patients. It provides $20 billion for additional resources for veterans™ healthcare. It authorizes an $11 billion catalyst toward the development of an effective 
vaccine and therapeutics. It provides $1 billion for community services block grants to support crit-
ical social service programs for mil-
lions of low-income individuals. It gives the Centers for Disease Con-trol additional funding to enhance its 
vital work. It assists communities responding to greater demands for services with an 
increase of $5 billion for community 
development block grants. That comes 
from the subcommittee that I chair. It helps with transit systems. 
There is widespread help for those who are homeless or who are among 
the most vulnerable in our population. It strengthens the low-income home heating assistance program. That is 
something Senator JACKREEDand I have long worked together on. We 
don™t want families and seniors making 
impossible choices between heating 
their homes and buying food or medi-
cine. This package also contains two addi-tional pieces of legislation that I have 
introduced and championed. First, it contains provisions from the Mitigating Emergency Drug Shortages, 
or MEDS, ActŠlegislation I authored 
that would help prevent a shortage of 
vital medication. I was shocked to 
learn that 72 percent of the facilities 
that make vital active pharmaceutical 
ingredients for our market here in 
America are located overseas. Thirteen 
percent of these facilities are in China. 
We just can™t have that. We need far 
greater visibility into that supply sys-
tem. It also contains a bill I have long ad-vocated forŠthe Home Health Care 
Planning Improvement Act. It will 
allow nurse practitioners, physician as-
sistants, and others to certify patients 
as needing home health services. Now 
it is just a physician who can do it 
even though the physician might not 
be the primary care provider, particu-
larly in rural areas. That will remove 
needless delays in getting Medicare pa-tients the home healthcare that they need. That is a critical improvement at 
a time when our healthcare system is 
being put to the test and when people 
are being told they need to stay in 
their own homes to avoid spreading the 
virus. The list of benefits that will be felt in communities across the country 
goes on and on. It is imperative that we pass this bill tonight. Every day, more small busi-
nesses are forced to close their doors. 
Every day, Americans are losing their 
jobs and their income. Every day, med-
ical professionals are increasingly 
overwhelmed by the exponential rise in 
cases. (Mrs. LOEFFLER assumes the chair.) 
The package we are voting to ad-vance tonight will bolster our 
healthcare system, infuse funds into 
biomedical research that will ulti-
mately produce a vaccine and effective 
treatments, shore up our economy and 
our businesses, support those who are 
unemployed, strengthen the link be-
tween employers and their employees, 
save millions of jobs of those employed 
by small businesses, and help prevent a 
devastating recession, perhaps even a 
depression, in this country. Let us not squander this momentum when we are so close to getting this 
done for the American people. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in passing 
this critical legislation. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maryland is recognized. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-dent, as other Senators have men-
tioned, we see our fellow Americans 
uniting around the country to fight the 
coronavirus and to help those in need. 
Most of all, we are grateful to the men 
and women in healthcare, the 
healthcare workers on the frontlines of 
this fightŠthe nurses, the doctors, all 
the other staff in hospitals and commu-
nity health centers and in clinics who 
are putting themselves and their own 
health at risk to help their fellow 
Americans. We in the Senate, like our fellow Americans, must come together to do 
the right thing for the country at this 
moment in timeŠto provide a surge of 
help to those on the frontlines of the 
coronavirus fight and to help those 
who are suffering from the economic 
fallout, workers and small businesses 
and midsize businesses and others who 
are absolutely getting clobbered as we 
all try to fight this virus together. Congress must unite this evening, as we have on two prior occasions during 
this emergency when we came together 
to pass phase 1 to provide emergency, 
immediate healthcare support to pub-
lic health entities and to provide more 
funds to do research on a vaccine for 
the coronavirus and more funds for re-
search on antivirals to address the 
coronavirus. Then we passed phase 2, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, where 
we made sure that testing was free be-cause we don™t want any American to say: I am not going to get tested even 
though I feel like I might have the 
symptoms. I am not going to get tested 
because I can™t afford it. It is putting both themselves and others in the community at risk. So we 
said we have to make sure these tests 
are free. We also provided sick leave because we don™t want anybody going to work 
when they feel sick and they have the 
virus if going to work is the only way 
they can put food on the table, by get-
ting a paycheck. So we said: Look, stay 
at home, and we will provide for paid 
leave. There was a gapŠa big gapŠin that that still needs to be addressed. We took some important measures in phase 1 and phase 2, and now here we 
are this evening on phase 3, where we 
are not only providing additional dol-
lars to fight the coronavirus and the 
health emergency but also dealing with 
the economic fallout, which is growing 
by the day. I am not going to go 
through all the provisions that do that. I will say that this bill is far from perfect. This is not a bill I would have 
written. I dare say it is probably not 
the bill that any one Senator would 
have written. But with all its flaws, it 
does some very important things that 
are absolutely necessary during this 
national emergency. There has been a lot of talk tonight about the unemployment compensation 
provision. Those are absolutely essen-
tial as a lifeline to workers who each 
day are losing their jobs around the 
country in many industries. It is abso-
lutely essential that in that process, 
people who are out of work through no 
fault of their own are still able to pay 
their bills, their rent or their mort-
gage, keep the lights on, get food, and 
that is why we are working to make 
sure they have real replacement in-
come during this 4-month emergency 
period. The provisions regarding small busi-nesses and middle-size businesses are 
very important too. I am sure we are 
all hearing from folks who already had 
to close their doors because when there 
are no customers coming in the door, 
there are no sales, no income, and so if 
you are a small business, you can™t 
make your debt payments and you 
can™t make payroll. So this bill does 
have a lot of very important provisions 
in it with respect to small businesses. I am really glad that we moved, with respect to small businesses, to loans 
onlyŠto loans that would be forgiven 
so long as the small businesses spent 
those monies to, one, maintain payroll 
or rehire people if they have already 
had to let them go, and, two, to pay es-
sential bills. Just adding more loans 
and debt onto small businesses would 
only be like an anchor around their 
necks at the end of a 4-month or what-
ever period it may be. They wouldn™t 
be able to dig themselves out of that 
hole. It was very important to have 
loans that will be forgiven so long as VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:32 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00037Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.060S25MRPT1

S2058 March 25, 2020 the loans are used for the intended pur-poses. We also made important provisions for nonprofits that hire millions of 
Americans and as well for midsize busi-
nesses. With respect to some of the largest industries in the country that have 
been hard hit, it is appropriate to also 
give them help, but it is also important 
that as we do that, we safeguard the 
American taxpayer and the public in-
terest. When the proposal first arrived here in the Senate from the White House, 
we were looking at about a $500 billion 
slush fund with no strings attached, no 
real accountability, and no real trans-
parency. So we tried to tie that down 
so that we will have an inspector gen-
eral with subpoena power that will en-
sure that there will be no stock 
buybacks with these emergency funds. 
Now, we are going to still look at the 
fine print, but we have come a long 
way from the proposed blank check to 
the Secretary of the Treasury, which 
was in the bill as it arrived here as pro-
posed by the administration. There is another thing that is in the bill that is before us tonight that was 
not in the bill proposed by the adminis-
tration, and that is badly needed help 
for States and cities and towns that 
are on the frontlines of this battle 
across the country. We heard about 5, 6 
days ago from the majority leader: Oh, 
well, let™s just wait. Maybe we can do 
that sometime down the road. Well, we heard from a bipartisan group of Governors through the Na-
tional Governors Association that they 
need that help now. I am sure you have 
all been fielding calls from your elect-
ed officials, your Governors and others, 
about how they desperately need addi-
tional help to fight this virus. I am 
glad this bill contains $150 billion to 
help those States. I want to raise tonight something that I discovered about this bill just a 
few hours ago that gives me real heart-
burn and actually, I believe, reflects 
badly on this Senate. Here is how we distributed the funds to the States. Each State, regardless of 
population, gets $1.2 billion, and then 
the remainder of the moneyŠup to $150 
billionŠis distributed to States based 
on population. You can question 
whether that is the best and most ef-
fective way to essentially allocate re-
sources when you are fighting a 
coronavirus like this, which is more in-
tense in some places than others, but 
that is not my overall point right now. Here is what we discovered: The peo-ple of the District of Columbia, the 
people of the Nation™s Capital, were 
left out of that formula. They are 
fighting the coronavirus just like 
Americans in every other State and 
city. They are part of other Federal 
formulas. For example, title I for edu-
cation, highway funds, and other Fed-
eral formula dollars go to the people of 
the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia has a popu-lation that is higher than 2 of the 50 States. There are more residents in the District of Columbia, the Nation™s Cap-
ital, than the State of Wyoming and 
the State of Vermont. They were left 
out of that category they are usually 
put in, and instead they were put into 
a formula with Puerto Rico, the Virgin 
Islands, American Samoa, and some of 
the territories. The net effect of thatŠthe net effect of putting the people in the Nation™s 
Capital in that formula versus the for-mula with the StatesŠwill cost the 
District of Columbia about $700 mil-
lion. That is because that other for-
mula is based entirely on population, 
and Puerto Rico has about 3 million 
people in it. So when you put the Dis-
trict of Columbia into that funding 
kettle, into that funding pot, they get 
shortchanged $700 million. That is the case even though the peo-ple of the District of Columbia send the 
Federal Treasury more tax dollars than 
the people of 22 other States. Let me 
say that again. The people of the Dis-
trict of Columbia send the IRS more 
tax revenues than the people of 22 
other States. Yet, when it came time 
to write the formula for distributing 
emergency funds under the 
coronavirus, they weren™t part of the 
kind of funding formulas they nor-
mally are. I asked about this because I thought maybe this would be a simple fix. I 
mean, surely in a bill of $2 trillion in 
emergency relief, we can do right by 
the people of the District of Columbia 
and not shortchange them $700 million. 
The answer I got back was no. No, no, 
this was not a mistake. This was not 
an oversight. Republican negotiators 
insisted on shortchanging the people of 
the District of Columbia. If I am wrong 
about that, it would be a very easy fix 
in an amendment that could be offered 
by the majority leader and, I am sure, 
accepted unanimouslyŠaccepted 
unanimouslyŠexcept for the fact that 
this actually was a point that was ne-
gotiated. I am not going to hold up a $2 trillion emergency rescue package that is ur-
gently needed by the country for this, 
but I think it is shameful. I think it is 
shameful that, in a $2 trillion emer-
gency rescue package, we would short-
change the people right here in the Na-
tion™s Capital, people whom we see 
coming into work every day, many of 
the Federal employees who work day in 
and day out for the Federal Govern-
ment. Many of them live here. Many of them live in surrounding States. Many 
of them live all over the country. But 
for the people who live here, to short-
change them and to do it intentionally 
is really outrageous. So here we are, coming together, and that is the right thing to do. As I said, 
this bill has many, many flaws and 
many, many problems. I certainly 
wouldn™t have written it this way, and 
I would never have done wrong by the 
people of the District of Columbia the 
way this was intentionally done, appar-
ently, in this bill. But, overall, we need this bill for the country. We need it because we have a 
national emergency, both on the 
healthcare front and the economic 
front. So I hope, going away from here, as we come together and I hope do the 
right thing with a large vote, that 
there will be some Senators, whoever 
were part of negotiating that deal and 
who said, no, we are going to short-
change the people in our Nation™s Cap-ital, will feel a little bit ashamed. And 
I think all those people who didn™t 
want to change this provision, which is 
easy to change just like that, should 
feel ashamed. This is our Nation™s Capital. The peo-ple who live and work here deserve to 
be treated with respect. There is no 
U.S. Senator who represents the people 
of the District of Columbia. Some of us 
who live in the surrounding areas work 
hard to do so. I just wish Senators from 
the rest of the country, and especially, 
in this case, apparently, our Repub-
lican colleagues, would show a little 
respect for the people who live in the 
Capitol of this great country. I yield the floor. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the final bill includes a 
stabilization fund for States that the 
pandemic has hit hard. Given the grow-
ing dire fiscal emergency States are 
facing as a result of the coronavirus, I 
think it is very likely we will need to 
come back and do more. States not 
only are fighting a growing pandemic, 
but also a bottoming out of State reve-
nues from a lack of sales taxes, as a re-
sult of responsible social distancing en-
couraged by the Federal Government, 
and income taxes, as a result of the De-
partment of Treasury delaying the tax 
filing deadline by 3 months. We all are 
monitoring the situation closely and 
will provide further aid if needed. For most States, maybe all of them, what they need to do with this money 
will be completely obvious, and we 
defer to the sound judgment of the 
States. Out of an abundance of caution, 
we included language requiring that 
expenditures be related to the 
coronavirus pandemic. This is intended 
to avoid a situation in which a State 
was to divert these funds to some new, 
unrelated project that had been re-
jected as part of the State™s regular 
budgeting process. We do not want to 
be paying for roads to nowhere or other 
trivial expenses. Again, for most States, this will not be an issue. The coronavirus has ex-
ploded their demand for services and 
strangled their revenue streams so this 
money will just be plugging those 
holes. No responsible Governor or legis-
lature is even thinking about new 
projects at this time. We understand 
that, at this point, all the impacts of 
the coronavirus pandemic are merging 
together. We do not intend to subject 
States to additional paperwork or arbi-
trary rules. If a State has needs that it 
would not have had without the 
coronavirus pandemic, that is more 
than good enough. VerDate Sep 11 2014 08:25 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00038Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.062S25MRPT1

formation of all of our Senators, we 
will first vote on the adoption of the 
Sasse amendment at a 60-vote thresh-
old, and then our second and final vote 
will be on passage of the CARES Act, 
also at a 60-vote threshold. We are 
going to pass this bipartisan relief 
package and send it over to the House 
so they can put it on the President™s 
desk. When the Senate adjourns this evening, our next scheduled vote will 
be the afternoon of Monday, April 20. 
Of course, during this unprecedented 
time for our country, the Senate is 
going to stay nimble. As always, we 
will convene regular pro forma ses-
sions, and if circumstances require the 
Senate to return for a vote sooner than 
April 20, we will provide at least 24 
hours™ notice. Our Nation obviously is going through a kind of crisis that is totally unprecedented in living memory. Let™s stay connected and continue to col-
laborate on the best ways to keep help-
ing our States and our country through 
this pandemic. Let™s continue to pray 
for one another, for all of our families, 
and for our country. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mi-nority leader is recognized. Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I will speak for a little bit, briefly. The legislation now before us is his-toric because it is meant to match a 
historic crisis. Our healthcare system 
is not prepared to care for the sick. Our 
workers are without work. Our busi-
nesses cannot do business. Our fac-
tories lie idle. The gears of the Amer-
ican economy have ground to a halt. 
Our country has faced immense chal-
lenges before but rarely so many at the 
same time. Over the past few days, the Senate has stepped into the breach. We packed 
weeks or perhaps months of legislative 
process into 5 days. Representatives 
from both sides of the aisle and both 
ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have 
forged the bipartisan agreement in 
highly partisan times with very little 
time to spare. It has been a long, hard 
road with a remarkable number of 
twists and turns, but for the sake of 
millions of Americans, it will be worth 
it. It will be worth it to save millions of small businesses and tens of millions of 
jobs. It will be worth it to see that Ameri-cans who have lost their jobs through 
no fault of their own will be able to pay 
their rent and mortgages and put food 
on the table because we passed the 
greatest expansion of insurance to the 
unemployed in decades. It will be worth it to send gloves and masks to our nurses and to our doctors. It will be worth it to send ventilators and beds to our hospitals and begin re-
building the public health infrastruc-
ture in AmericaŠa Marshall Plan in 
this new century for our medical sys-
tem. It will be worth it to save industries from the brink of collapse in order to 
save the jobs of hundreds of thousands 
of Americans in those industries. It will be worth it to put workers first. It was a long, hard road. Neither side can be completely happy with the final 
product, but it will be worth it. I am damn proud of the work we did over the past few days because we put 
in the work. Because we tested the lim-
its of exhaustion, because we didn™t im-
mediately accept the bill drafted by 
only one party, the legislation before 
us tonight is betterŠbetter for our 
healthcare system and 65,000 Ameri-
cans now afflicted with COVIDŒ19, bet-
ter for our workers, better for our 
small businesses, better for our Indian 
Tribes, better for our economy, and 
better for the American people. So I must thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisleŠespecially the 
chairs and ranking members and their staffs. The past few days have been filled with drama. The past few hours 
were no exception. I know a few of my 
Republican friends still harbor reserva-
tions about voting for this legislation, 
but when there is a crisis of this mag-
nitude, the private sector cannot solve 
it. Individuals, even with bravery and 
valor, are not powerful enough to beat 
it back. Government is the only force 
large enough to staunch the bleeding 
and begin the healing. This is a time when the American people need their government. This is 
what we were elected for. The oath we 
swear to the Constitution means we 
must protect the general welfare of the 
people. So let us marshal this govern-
ment into action. There are millions of Americans watching us right now at home on their 
televisions, separated from friends and 
family, fearful for their children and 
their livelihoods, unsure of when the 
time will come when all of our lives 
may return to normal. Let us tell them 
tonight that help is on the way; that 
they are not truly alone; that this 
country, that this Senate, that this 
government is here for them in a time 
of dire need. This is a strange and evil 
disease. There is much we still don™t 
know about it, and it is keeping us 
apart. When we pass this bill, instead 
of hugging each other, we will wave 
from a distance. None of us can know when this plague will pass. The only thing we 
know for sure is that we must summon 
the same spirit that saw previous gen-
erations through America™s darkest 
hours. Fellowship, sacrifice, fortitude, 
resilienceŠthat is what it means to be 
an American. With that spirit, this Na-
tion faced down war and depression and 
fear itself. I have no doubt that once again America will ultimately prevail. I yield the floor.

in a period of morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f CORONAVIRUS Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, we just finished here, on the Senate floor, 
some very, very important work for 
the people we represent and have the 
privilege to serve. It is what we are 
calling phase 3 of our very important 
response to this unprecedented pan-
demic that is hitting our country, the 
health of our country, and the eco-
nomic health of our Nation. So we acted. A number of us worked, over the past week, around the clock to 
put this legislation together, and I 
think it was a strong showing of bipar-
tisan support. I was on the floor a couple of days ago saying that what we needed to do 
were four key things: Put cash directly 
in the hands of hurting families in 
Alaska and throughout the country; 
deliver rapid relief to small businesses 
that are being crushed by this pan-
demic and having to lay off workers; 
stabilize key sectors of the economy to 
avoid more layoffs that are now quick-
ly coming over the horizon and have 
started happening; and send a surge of 
new resources to medical professionals 
who are on the frontlines. We did that. 
We did that relatively quickly. It could 
have been faster, but those were our 
goals, and that is what we achieved 
here. But here is a fact. This was legisla-tion that was very important. It wasn™t 
perfect, and there is probably a lot of 
mistakes here. We are going to need to 
correct them quickly. There are prob-
ably Americans who weren™t covered in 
some way, shape, or form by this legis-
lation, who need help, and we are going 
to need to cover them quickly. There 
are likely new challenges in this pan-
demic that seems to be changing every 
dayŠnew challenges with regard to 
this crisis that we are going to need to 
address. The final thing is, when we look at what we just did here, this was focused VerDate Sep 11 2014 22:06 May 11, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00040Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\RECORD20\MARCH\S25MR0.RECS25MR0
sradovich on DSKJLST7X2PROD with SENATE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDŠSENATE
S2061 March 25, 2020 on the immediate crisisŠbusiness interruptions and the health crisis, but 
what we need to be looking at is when 
we get through this crisisŠand we will, 
more resilient and stronger than ever. As I mentioned in my remarks the other day, some Washington Post re-
porters a couple of days ago questioned 
the mettle and resiliency of Ameri-
cans. Maybe we are not as tough and 
strong as we used to be to get through 
these crises. They just need to go to 
Alaska and recognize how wrong they 
are in that or see some of the marines 
that I had the privilege of serving with 
for the last 26 years. They would recog-
nize quickly that they are wrong. Of 
course, we have the mettle and tenac-
ity to do this. We need to be working on phase 4. Phase 4 is going to be the policies that 
we implement here in the Congress to 
turbocharge this economy, so when we 
are out of this crisis, we can come back 
fully, more strongly in a way that our 
economy was just 2 months ago. There is a lot of work that I think we could be doing, and that we are likely 
going to have to be doing. A number of 
us are going to begin working on that 
phase 4 approach to this pandemic to 
turbocharge this economy once we get 
out of it. I am glad to start working on 
that with my colleagues here in the 
Senate. So, as I said, there is a lot of work to do, but the Senate is getting ready for 
a recess for almost a month. That is 
what we are getting ready to do. The 
country is facing one of the biggest cri-
ses in our history, and the Senate is 
leaving town for a month. I happen to 
think this is a mistake. I think it sends 
the wrong signal to the people we 
serve. I think our duty station should 
be here, to be ready on a moment™s no-
tice to help the citizens that we have 
the privilege of serving, because if 
there is one thing about this crisis that 
we have already seen is that new chal-
lenges pop up every day, every minute, 
every hour, and, yet, we are going to go 
on recess for almost a month. I don™t understand this. I don™t agree with it, and I certainly hope if and 
when our country needs us, if we see 
some big mistakes in this legislation, 
if we recognize whole groups of Ameri-
cans don™t get the relief they need and 
the Congress needs to act, that we are 
not going to just say: Well, we are on 
recess for 30 days. Sorry. We will get to 
you when we come back at the end of 
April. I think that would be a real mistake because, as we are seeing in this crisis, 
there are a lot of answers that just 
can™t wait until the end of April. There 
are a lot of challenges that we need to 
be addressing daily, and there are 
going to be more, and, yet, we will not 
be here to address them. So, at a minimum, I hope that when our country needs us in the next 
monthŠand it is likely going to need 
usŠthat my colleagues will be ready, 
on a moment™s notice, wherever they 
are, to come back to this body and get to work to help the people we serve. I think it is very likely that that is 
going to happen in the next week or 
two or three, and I hope my colleagues 
stand ready to do that and not use the 
excuse that we will see at the end of 
April to address your problems, Amer-
ica. That is not what we need to be 
doing in the midst of this very, very se-
rious unprecedented crisis where our 
citizens need our help. We had a good start tonightŠa very good startŠbut there is going to be a 
lot more, and I hope this body is ready 
to act quickly. I yield the floor.

CAPUTO Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor Judge 
James M. Munley and Judge A. Rich-
ard Caputo, who collectively served the 
Middle District of Pennsylvania as 
Federal district judges for over 40 
years. Judge Munley was a native of Archi-bald, PA. After graduating from the 
University of Scranton in 1958, he 
joined the U.S. Army and served until 
1960. After his military service, Judge 
Munley enrolled at the Temple Univer-
sity School of Law and graduated in 
1963. He clerked for the Honorable Mi-
chael J. Eagen on the Supreme Court 
of Pennsylvania before practicing law 
in Scranton from 1964 to 1978. From 
1978 to 1998, Judge Munley served with 
distinction as a judge on the Lacka-
wanna County Court of Common Pleas. 
In 1998, Judge Munley was nominated 
to a seat on the U.S. District Court for 
the Middle District of Pennsylvania by 
President Bill Clinton. He was con-
firmed by the Senate and went on to 
serve the Middle District honorably for 
over two decades. As a Federal judge, Judge Munley continued his family™s tremendous leg-
acy of public service and dedication to 
Pennsylvania. Both of his parents, 
Robert W. Munley and Marion L. 
Munley, and his grandfather, William 
J. Munley, served in the Pennsylvania 
General Assembly. Judge Munley has 
been remembered by members of the Pennsylvania legal community as a 
skilled, good-natured, and fair jurist 
who approached life with a sense of op-
timism that ‚‚was contagious in the 
best sense of the word.™™ In his court-
room and in his life, he was known to 
treat everyone with the same dignity, 
respect, and kindness. U.S. District 
Judge Malachy E. Mannion remem-
bered Judge Munley by noting: ‚‚What 
defined him most was just his sense of 
humanity. He was a great judge, but he 
was a greater human being.™™ Judge Caputo was born in Port Ches-ter, NY, and raised in Rye, NY. He 
graduated from Brown University in 
1960. After Brown, Judge Caputo en-
rolled in the University of Pennsyl-
vania Law School and graduated in 
1963. He went on to join the U.S. Air 
Force as an officer in the Judge Advo-
cate General™s Corps and served until VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:53 Mar 26, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00041Fmt 4624Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\G25MR6.069S25MRPT1

S2062 March 25, 2020 1967. After his military service, Judge Caputo worked as a public defender in 
Luzerne County for 1 year before join-
ing the law firm of Shea & Shea. In 
1973, the firm was renamed Shea, Shea 
& Caputo, and after nearly 30 years in 
private practice, Judge Caputo was 
nominated to a seat on the U.S. Dis-
trict Court for the Middle District of 
Pennsylvania by President Bill Clinton 
in 1997. After being confirmed by the 
Senate, he honorably served on the 
Federal bench in the Middle District 
for over two decades. Judge Caputo was known as a strong and fair jurist who treated everyone 
with deep respect in his courtroom. He 
strongly believed in balancing indi-
vidual rights with the needs of a well- 
ordered society, and some in the Penn-
sylvania legal community have remem-
bered him as a judge who was not 
afraid to depart from Federal sen-
tencing guidelines when he found them 
to be too harsh. He was deeply com-
mitted to the judiciary, as evidenced 
by the fact that he continued to hear 
cases up until just a few months prior 
to his death. He believed that the judi-
ciary was the heart of our democracy. 
Chief U.S. District Judge Christopher 
Conner remembered Judge Caputo as a 
‚‚‚judge™s judge™Ša strong, direct and 

erudite jurist,™™ who made ‚‚extraor-
dinary contributions to the Wilkes- 
Barre vicinage, to our entire court, and 
to our country.™™ At a time when our Nation faces un-precedented challenges in responding 
to the COVIDŒ19 pandemic, Judge 
Munley and Judge Caputo are impor-
tant reminders of the intellect, com-
passion, and fairness that have guided 
our Nation since its founding. They 
will be missed tremendously, but their 
legacy will continue to inspire count-
less Pennsylvanians and individuals 
throughout our country.f TRIBUTE TO INEZ MITTLEIDER Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I want to honor a very special North Dakota 
woman who is turning 100 years old on 
Friday. Inez Mittleider of Bismarck 
was born on March 27, 1920, in South 
Dakota and at a young age moved with 
her family to southwestern North Da-
kota. Living thorough the Dirty Thir-
ties and the Great Depression, she had 
to leave home and live with family 
friends while she completed high 
school. She was one of very few women 
of her generation to earn a college de-
gree. Inez lived in the communities of 
Heil and Mott and taught in one-room 
schoolhouses for nearly 10 years. Inez and her husband raised four chil-dren and instilled in them the neces-
sity of hard work and self reliance. 
Today, Inez is the grandmother of 
seven, great-grandmother of nine, and 
continues to live on her own in Bis-
marck. Her many family members plan 
to gather to celebrate this centennial 
milestone with Inez later in the year. Mr. President, North Dakota is home to more than 200 centenarians, and we consider them among our most treas-ured residents. They have witnessed 
great moments in North Dakota™s his-
tory and their pioneer spirit, dignity, 
and hard work have brought them 
through many challenges and personal 
achievements. On behalf of all North Dakotans, I want to wish Inez a happy 100th birth-
day, and hope this is the start of a year 
filled with happiness and joy.f INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS The following bills and joint resolu-tions were introduced, read the first

rity of covered loans, so as to avoid balloon 
payments or any requirement for increases 
in debt payments resulting from deferments 
provided by lenders during the period of the 
national emergency declared by the Presi-
dent under the National Emergencies Act (50

adding at the end the following: ‚‚§710. Emergency relief authority 
‚‚(a) EMERGENCYACTION.ŠIf, on or before December 31, 2021, the Register of Copyrights 
determines that a national emergency de-
clared by the President under the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) gen-
erally disrupts or suspends the ordinary 
functioning of the copyright system under 
this title, or any component thereof, includ-
ing on a regional basis, the Register may, on 
a temporary basis, toll, waive, adjust, or 
modify any timing provision (including any 
deadline or effective period, except as pro-
vided in subsection (c)) or procedural provi-
sion contained in this title or chapters II or 
III of title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, 
for no longer than the Register reasonably 
determines to be appropriate to mitigate the 
impact of the disruption caused by the na-
tional emergency. In taking such action, the 
Register shall consider the scope and sever-
ity of the particular national emergency, 
and its specific effect with respect to the 
particular provision, and shall tailor any 
remedy accordingly. ‚‚(b) NOTICEAND
EFFECT.ŠAny action taken by the Register in response to a na-
tional emergency pursuant to subsection (a) 
shall not be subject to section 701(e) or sub-
chapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United 
States Code, and chapter 7 of title 5, United 
States Code. The provision of general public 
notice detailing the action being taken by 
the Register in response to the national 
emergency under subsection (a) is sufficient 
to effectuate such action. The Register may 
make such action effective both prospec-
tively and retroactively in relation to a par-
ticular provision as the Register determines 
to be appropriate based on the timing, scope, 
and nature of the public emergency, but any 
action by the Register may only be retro-
active with respect to a deadline that has 
not already passed before the declaration de-
scribed in subsection (a). ‚‚(c) STATEMENTREQUIRED.ŠExcept as pro-vided in subsection (d), not later than 20 
days after taking any action that results in 
a provision being modified for a cumulative 
total of longer than 120 days, the Register 
shall submit to Congress a statement detail-
ing the action taken, the relevant back-
ground, and rationale for the action. ‚‚(d) EXCEPTIONS.ŠThe authority of the Register to act under subsection (a) does not 
extend provisions under this title requiring 
the commencement of an action or pro-
ceeding in Federal court within a specified 
period of time, except that if the Register 
adjusts the license availability date defined in section 115(e)(15), such adjustment shall not affect the ability to commence actions 
for any claim of infringement of exclusive 
rights provided by paragraphs (1) and (3) of 
section 106 against a digital music provider 
arising from the unauthorized reproduction 
or distribution of a musical work by such 
digital music provider in the course of en-
gaging in covered activities that accrued 
after January 1, 2018, provided that such ac-
tion is commenced within the time periods 
prescribed under section 115(d)(10)(C)(i) or 
115(d)(10)(C)(ii) as calculated from the ad-
justed license availability date. If the Reg-
ister adjusts the license availability date, 
the Register must provide the statement to 
Congress under subsection (c) at the same 
time as the public notice of such adjustment 
with a detailed explanation of why such ad-
justment is needed. ‚‚(e) COPYRIGHTTERMEXCEPTION.ŠThe au-thority of the Register to act under sub-
section (a) does not extend to provisions 
under chapter 3, except section 304(c), or sec-
tion 1401(a)(2). ‚‚(f) OTHERLAWS.ŠNotwithstanding sec-tion 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1631), the authority of the Register 
under subsection (a) is not contingent on a 
specification made by the President under 
such section or any other requirement under 
that Act (other than the emergency declara-
tion under section 201(a) of such Act (50 
U.S.C. 1621(a))). The authority described in 
this section supersedes the authority of title
