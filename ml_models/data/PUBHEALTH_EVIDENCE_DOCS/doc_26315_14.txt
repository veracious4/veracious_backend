         Abstract
          Background Employment instability is a major source of strain affecting an increasing number of adults in the United States.
 Unadjusted rates of age-specific AMI were used to demonstrate observed differences by employment status, cumulative number of job losses, and cumulative time unemployed.
 Among the sample, 14.0% of subjects were unemployed at baseline, 69.7% had 1 or more cumulative job losses, and 35.1% had spent time unemployed.
 Unadjusted plots showed that age-specific rates of AMI differed significantly for each dimension of work history.
 Risks for AMI were particularly elevated within the first year of unemployment (hazard ratio, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.01-1.60]) but not thereafter.
 Results were robust after adjustments for multiple clinical, socioeconomic, and behavioral risk factors.Conclusions Unemployment status, multiple job losses, and short periods without work are all significant risk factors for acute cardiovascular events.
 More than 1 million Americans experienced a first or a recurrent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 2010, and more than half died as a result.1-4 Although major risk factors for coronary heart disease have been well documented (eg, inactivity, obesity, hypertension),3,5-8 the effect of social stressors on AMI are still poorly understood.
 We used data from a nationally representative sample of middle-aged and older adults followed up biennially from 1992 to 2010 to examine the effect of unemployment status, cumulative job losses, and duration of unemployment on risks for AMI.
 The associations were examined with adjustments for multiple socioeconomic, behavioral, psychological, and clinical factors.
 We also examined whether the associations between job instability and AMI risk differed by sex and race/ethnicity.
 Methods
            
         Study population
           We used nationally representative data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for analysis.
 The HRS is an ongoing prospective cohort study of US adults older than 50 years sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.32 The original HRS cohort included 9824 age-eligible respondents (ie, ages 51-61 years) who have been interviewed biennially since 1992.
 The initial participation rate was 81.7%, and reinterview rates were 93.7% for 1994 through 2010, with low rates of attrition due to nonresponse and lost tracking.
 Since 1998, the HRS has been supplemented with age-selective birth cohorts to replenish the nationally representative sample of older adults.
 Details of the multistage sampling design, implementation, and response rates have been documented in detail elsewhere.32,33  The analytic sample for the study included 13 451 participants from the original HRS birth cohort (1931-1941), the war baby cohort (1942-1947), and early baby-boomer cohort (1948-1953) who were first interviewed in 1992, 1998, and 2004, respectively, and reinterviewed through 2010.
 A person-year file was constructed from the respondents' age-specific cumulative exposure to AMI so that each observation was a record for every additional year beyond their age at entry in the study.
 Analyses were restricted to adults aged 51 to 75 years who reported having ever worked (95.8%).
 On average, HRS participants contributed approximately 8 person-years of exposure during the 18-year study period.
 A total of 1061 AMI events (7.9%) were reported during the 165 169 person-years of observation.
 Measurement
           We used more than 50 years of prospective and retrospective data from the HRS to reconstruct employment histories for each study participant.
 Information about past employment was collected at the respondents' baseline interview, and information about current jobs (and changes) was obtained from the prospective interviews.
 Work-history timing was ascertained from detailed responses to questions about the beginning and ending dates (in years and/or months) of all jobs reported by HRS participants.
 Although we could not confirm the retrospective dates of employment status and change, studies have shown substantial congruence between dates reported retrospectively and those reported by the same individuals in a panel design.34 Nevertheless, recall or omissions (eg, brief employment in early adulthood) may have led to undercounts of the total number of jobs—and potential job losses—reported for some participants.
 The subjects' month- and year-specific information was converted to age-specific data using the dates of birth, interview, and event.
 Established literature and extensive preliminary analyses were used to determine the measures that were most psychometrically sound and substantively appropriate for analysis.
 Persons who were not employed and not retired were considered unemployed in this study.
