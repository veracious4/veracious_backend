 I'm coining a phrase here, but the usage has been approved by David Emery, who follows the strange world of Net hoaxes and other misinformation for the Web directory About.com (urbanlegends.about.com).A while back I received an e-mail message relating the story of a poor fellow named Turklebaum who had died at his desk while working for a New York publisher.
 It took five days for his co-workers to figure out he was dead.Sensing a story too good to be true, I rushed to a new service called Purportal.com to check its veracity.
 Purportal searches four different sites, including Mr. Emery's, that track urban legends, fake virus warnings and the like.
 You merely enter a keyword or even a patch of text from a forwarded piece of e-mail (it doesn't search all four at once, but that's a minor quibble).The result was as expected: Turklebaum, according to two of the sites searched, was a fraud.Purportal addresses a real need.
 ''A credulous person with an e-mail account is a dangerous thing,'' said Ruby Watkins, general manager of the site.
 Not only is there ''a lot of uncertainty on the Web about what's true or not,'' Mr. Emery said, but there is a strange persistence to these forwarded tales.
 ''Things I saw four years ago are still going around,'' he added.
 ''These stories seem to fight to stay alive.
 Somewhere, Turklebaum is still dying and, it seems, always will be.
 ''Not AmusedSpeaking of bogus content, George Carlin probably holds the Net record for having material -- joke lists, essays, quotes -- incorrectly attributed to him.
 Now he's fighting back on his Web site (www.georgecarlin.com/georgecarlin/home/dontblame.html).
 In particular, two essays widely circulated online -- ''A Bad American'' and ''A Paradox of Our Time'' -- have riled Mr. Carlin because, as he points out, they are not funny.
 Yet the Google search engine yields tens of thousands of links to this material.
 Mr. Carlin is now offering to confirm what is his and what isn't if the content in question is posted to his site's bulletin board.
 That is, if the poster is serious.
 No funny stuff.Elite DigitsInstant messaging -- real-time electronic text conversations -- is a bona fide cultural phenomenon.
 America Online, for instance, says that membership in its two services, Instant Messenger and ICQ (''I Seek You''), exceeds 200 million.Although active users probably number in the tens of millions based on daily log-in figures, that's still a fairly big chunk of the online population.
 But whenever the masses embrace an activity, some will try to establish an elite status to distance themselves from the rabble.
 Take the case of ICQ, which is free and emerged in 1997.
 On eBay, a small but regular auction market has developed for ICQ user identification numbers with only six digits -- the shortest possible.
 And it's not just because they are easier to remember than longer ones.A six-digit ID ''means that you are a hacker or a very early Internet user,'' explained Maxym Borysenko, a recent bidder who currently has an eight-digit number.
 New ICQ users are issued numbers with as many as nine digits.Some of the six-digit ID's have sold for more than $150.
 ''A certain status has developed'' around the low numbers, said Cindy Harvey, an AOL spokeswoman.But another bidder on eBay, Brian Patterson, disdains those who seek such user ID's for status rather than convenience.
 ''If I happen to win a small number for a few bucks, then so be it,'' he said.
 ''I'm not betting my online identity on a number.
 ''Follow That DreamThis, actually, is the stuff dreams are made on.At DreamBank (www.dreambank.net) you can search by keyword a database of nearly 10,000 dreams collected by psychology researchers from the University of California at Santa Cruz.
 The site argues that dreams can be studied scientifically since dream content correlates with factors like age and mental health and generally reflects ''waking concerns.
 ''The interface is geared for students and researchers -- I didn't find it terribly friendly -- but some of the statistical findings on the companion site DreamResearch are fascinating.
 (Why do women's dreams tend to have more people in them than men's?)G.
 William Demhoff, the professor who runs the site, revealed that most people search the dream database for sexual terms.
 ''That nets them nothing,'' he said, ''because sex is relatively rare in dreams -- less than 10 percent of dreams in our collection contain even a romantic hug or kiss.
 ''DreamBank does not collect dreams over the Net -- ''too many people make things up,'' Mr. Demhoff said.
 But other sites lacking a scientific mandate do.
 The Collective Unconsciousness Project (tcup.currentform.com) lets you create your own private dream log and contribute to a public database.
