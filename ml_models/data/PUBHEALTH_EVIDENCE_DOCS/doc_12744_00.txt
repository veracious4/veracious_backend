 In February, the Texas agriculture commissioner announced that he approved the use of a poison that he says may herald a "feral hog apocalypse" in a state where an estimated 2.5 million hogs roam.

 Will Herring, owner of Wild Boar Meats, last week won a court order temporarily halting Miller’s Feb. 21 rule allowing use of “Kaput Feral Hog Lure,” arguing the measure would spook pet food companies he sells to and put him out of business.
 Herring said he’d since secured Rep. Kyle Kacal, R-Bryan, as primary sponsor for legislation that would require study of chemicals before they are approved.
 The deadline to file bills for the current state legislative session is Friday.
 “All our bill says is, ‘Let’s have a state agency and/or state educational institution study this poison and any other poison before it before it becomes legal,’” Herring said from Austin, where he was recruiting state lawmakers to back the bill.
 “There’s not one public study, and by public study I mean a study available to the public, that has looked at using the product Kaput to poison feral hogs.” Kaput’s key ingredient is warfarin, a chemical which is used as both a poison for rats and blood thinner depending on concentration.
 Hogs that consume the bait essentially die from internal bleeding.
 Miller said his rule would unleash a “major new weapon” against a feral hog population that causes an estimated $52 million in annual damages.
 But the rule drew heat from hog hunters and processors who said Miller was allowing a poison to be released into the food chain, potentially harming wild animals that feed on hog carcasses and tainting meat consumed by pets and humans.
 As of Monday, a petition by the Texas Hog Hunters Association had more than 15,000 signatures opposing the rule.
 Herring said he was processing as many as 5,000 hogs a month and was getting ready to break ground on a new facility when Miller announced a rule that could potentially put he and other wild hog processors out of business.
 “We have not developed a way to test for it, nor have we developed a way to inactivate it,” Herring said.
 “If someone said, ‘Look, I only want to buy warfarin-free wild hog meat,’ we do not know a way that we could guarantee that.
 And that’s a problem to me.
 “It’s not just me that’s concerned about this,” Herring added.
 “I only do the pet food business.
 There’s a couple of companies that deal with the human consumption business, and it’s the same issue.” Herring last Wednesday filed a lawsuit against Miller’s rule, with the Texas Hog Hunters Association and Environmental Defense Fund filing supporting briefs.
 State District Judge Jan Soifer in Austin on Thursday issued a temporary restraining order stopping Kaput use in Texas until March 30, saying the TDA did not follow the Texas Administrative Procedures Act and agreeing that allowing Kaput would cause “immediate and irreparable harm” to Wild Boar Meats.
 “We hope that Commissioner Miller will now follow the law and allow public comment and careful consideration before proposing use of any poison on feral hogs,” Eydin Hansen, vice president of the Texas Hog Hunters Association, said of Soifer’s order.
 “Spreading rat poison across Texas lands would hurt Texas hunters, Texas hunting-supply businesses, Texas feral-hog meat processing businesses, Texas ranchers, and the Texas environment.” The TDA in a news release said Soifer’s order did away with the safeguards built into Miller’s rule, to including limiting the purchase and use to licensed applicators.
 The news release said there would be no further TDA comment due to the pending litigation.
 “The Kaput Feral Hog Bait had already been registered for use in Texas following the approval of the product by the federal Environmental Protection Agency as an unrestricted pesticide, similar to household rat bait,” the TDA said.
 “However, the agency decided additional protections for hunters, landowners and consumers were needed before the product could be used in Texas.” Herring said the TDA was “spinning” the court order.
 “The product is not available for sale yet, they’re planning on rolling it out in May,” he said.
 The website for the Kaput line on Monday said “coming soon.” Miller in a February interview said the bait would be administered in special feeders designed with 16-pound lids to prevent deer and other wildlife from consuming it.
 He said Scimetrics, the Colorado-based manufacturer of Kaput, had asked him to help find manufacturers to make the feeders.
 “Nothing is available for purchase in Texas as of today,” Herring said of the product and the feeder.
