 ","In 1989, Stef moved to Athens, Greece, where he worked as a freelance reporter and producer for major television, radio and print outlets such as CNN, BBC, CBC, The European and USA Today.
 ","After a year covering the Gulf War and the Kurdish refugee crisis for CNN, he was named Amman bureau chief and correspondent.
 From there, he covered most of the top stories of the 1990s, including the wars of [former] Yugoslavia, the Somali civil war and the humanitarian response, the Middle East peace process.
 His reporting sent him to the corners of the Caucasus, Middle East, Europe, and East and South Africa.
 ","Stef made the switch to public radio in the summer of 2001, and has worked on several WBUR-produced programs, including \u003Cem\u003EHere &amp; Now\u003C\u002Fem\u003E and now \u003Cem\u003EOn Point.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E","Stef speaks many languages, most of them really badly: English, Greek, French, Turkish, Arabic.
 If phrases like “good morning,” “thank you” and “who stole my pen?” can be considered fluency, he can pretend to have some command of Serbo-Croatian, Somali, Swahili, Kurdish, Persian and Armenian.
 As for his family life, there's one great vernacular expression in Greek to describe him: \"Χαζο-μπαμπάς.\" Feel free to look it up.
