 The pathophysiology of premature ejaculation appears to be multifactorial, implicating the need for multimodal therapeutic regimens to successfully treat premature ejaculation.
 Multiple treatment regimens have been shown to be effective in extending the time between penetration and ejaculation.
 These treatment modalities include everything from behavioral modifications and medications to diet alterations and major surgery.
 The goal of the present article was to review the commonly used treatment regimens used in the treatment of premature ejaculation, as well as to introduce and discuss the newest treatment routines under study for the treatment of premature ejaculation.

 A psychological approach, which was initially used in DSM‐IV, diagnoses the pathology based on subjective feelings rather than utilizing specific cut‐off points for ejaculation time.2, 3 Using this definition, PE was defined as ejaculation with both minimal stimulation and before the patient desires.
 This use of vague language had the potential to overdiagnose men who do not suffer from PE, and to underdiagnose men who do.2, 3 Recently, this was changed in the DSM‐V to include a cut‐off time of ejaculation within 1 min of vaginal penetration that causes significant distress.3 In contrast to the psychological theory, a definition created by Waldinger et al.
 proposed that PE should be defined solely based on the time between beginning intercourse and ejaculation, known as the IELT.2 The World Health Organization's ICD‐10 definition of PE includes both an inability to control ejaculation, as well as a cut‐off of ejaculation within 15 s of beginning intercourse.3 This debate over the definition of PE makes the assessment and diagnosis difficult for providers, further obscuring the prevalence of the pathology and delaying treatment.1-3 For this reason, it is difficult to determine a true estimate of the prevalence of PE in the population.
 Many patients suffering from PE experience increased distress, anxiety and depression, as well as overall dissatisfaction with sexual intercourse.1, 3 Clarifying the diagnostic criteria for PE might allow undiagnosed patients to receive treatment that could improve their quality of life.1-3 For the purposes of the present review, we focused on an IELT of                   INSTITUTIONAL LOGIN &gt;             Change Password        Old Password       New Password     Too Short Weak Medium Strong Very Strong Too Long       Password Changed Successfully Your password has been changed           Create a new account      Email or Customer ID                    Returning user                 Forgot your password?
