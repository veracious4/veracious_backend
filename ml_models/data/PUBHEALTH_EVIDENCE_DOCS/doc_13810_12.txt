CCSs 
 are flexible to align with the national health planning cycle (generally 4-5 years).
 After the WHO country office and the government finalize the CCS, the country office develops a CCS Brief.
 The 2-page brief is updated each year, in advance of the World 
 Health Assembly.
 It summarizes:  the main features of the country context in relation to health, development and cooperation with partners; WHO’s main work priorities with the country in the medium term; and key public health indicators, utilizing data from the WHO Global Health Observatory.
 All available CCSs and CCS Briefs are searchable from the menu below – by WHO region, 
 country and language of the document.
