 Bergdahl be charged for leaving his post?
 03:41The officials would not say which of the five men is suspected.
 But an ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar turned up evidence in recent months that one of them has "reached out" to try to encourage militant activity, one official said.
 The official would offer no further details.
 "What I can say with confidence is this individual has not returned to the battlefield, this individual is not allowed to travel outside Qatar, and this individual has not engaged in any physical violence," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday.
 Under current law, this act placed the man in the category of being "suspected" of re-engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.
 However, several officials say there is now a debate inside the administration that the intelligence may be stronger than the "suspected" classification.
 Some elements of the intelligence community believe the information is strong enough to classify the man as "confirmed" for returning to illegal activities.
 All five men are having their communications even more closely monitored right now, but the belief is there is no current threat, one official told CNN.
 Publicly, administration officials are emphasizing that the activity in question was revealed through monitoring mechanisms the U.S. and Qatar put into effect for the very purpose of preventing recidivism.
 "The fact that our mitigation measures helped alert us to potential concerns about one of these individuals means that our mitigation measures are working and have allowed us to make appropriate adjustments in a timely manner to properly mitigate any potential threats."
 "We have a strong security partnership with Qatar, and are in constant dialogue with Qatari government officials about these five detainees and we are confident that we would be able to mitigate any threat of re-engagement by any of these members," Kirby said in an interview that will air Thursday night on CNN's 'Erin Burnett Out Front.
 'Under intelligence laws, the definition of "confirmed" for returning to militant activity is that there is a "preponderance of information which identifies a specific former GITMO detainee as directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities."
 The definition of 'suspected" is that there is "plausible but unverified or single-source reporting indicating a specific former Gitmo detainee is directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities."
 Bowe Bergdahl.
 The precise terms of their release to Qatar -- and the Qataris promise to monitor their activities -- has never been made public.
 All five are believed to still be in that country, U.S. officials said.The five, who mostly held mid- to high-level positions within the Taliban before their capture during the early days of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, were detained because of their association with the Taliban, not because of any ties to al Qaeda.
 One of the men was alleged to have been "directly associated" with Osama bin Laden, while another commanded the main force fighting the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in 2001.
 Another of the men was a senior official in the Taliban intelligence service, while another served as head of the Taliban's communications effort, and also helped al Qaeda members escape into Pakistan.The release of the five Taliban has been highly controversial and politically sensitive for the Obama administration.
 Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had to agree to the release, but his own staff has long noted his doubts.President Barack Obama maintained he received assurances from the Qatari government about the five detainees before their release, but noted the difficult road ahead.
 "I wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security," Obama said at a news conference in Poland a few days after the transfer.
 "And we have confidence that we will be in a position to go after them if, in fact, they are engaging in activities that threaten our defenses," he said.

 "He believes that the risk has been substantially mitigated through the assurances that we received through the Emir of Qatar," Kirby said at the time of the release.
 "I would remind you that these are assurances that the emir personally gave to the President of the United States.
 I'm not going to go into every detail on these assurances, but -- but the secretary is comfortable that the risk is mitigated through these assurances.
 "Congress receives a report every six months on the status of detainees transferred out of Gitmo.
 The latest report in September 2014, showed about 17% of detainees transferred out of Guantanamo Bay are confirmed by the U.S. to have returned to militant activity.
 About 12% are in the suspected category.

 Two senior administration officials confirmed the names of the released detainees, whose photos were obtained by WikiLeaks.
 Khair Ulla Said Wali Khairkhwa, seen here, was an early member of the Taliban in 1994 and was interior minister during the Taliban's rule.
 He was arrested in Pakistan and was transferred to Guantanamo in May 2002.
 During questioning, Khairkhwa denied all knowledge of extremist activities.Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Guantanamo detainees swapped for BergdahlMullah Mohammad Fazl commanded the main force fighting the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in 2001, and served as chief of army staff under the Taliban regime.
 Fazl was detained after surrendering to Abdul Rashid Dostam, the leader of Afghanistan's Uzbek community, in November 2001.
 He was transferred into U.S. custody in December 2001 and was one of the first arrivals at Guantanamo, where he was assessed as having high intelligence value.Hide Caption 2 of 5 Photos: Guantanamo detainees swapped for BergdahlMullah Norullah Noori served as governor of Balkh province in the Taliban regime and played some role in coordinating the fight against the Northern Alliance.
 Like Fazl, Noori was detained after surrendering to Dostam, the Uzbek leader, in 2001.Hide Caption 3 of 5 Photos: Guantanamo detainees swapped for BergdahlAbdul Haq Wasiq was the deputy chief of the Taliban regime's intelligence service.
