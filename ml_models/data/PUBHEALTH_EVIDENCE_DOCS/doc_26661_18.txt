Reductions and Eliminations 
Reductions and eliminations are summarized below, by account, in descending order. More detailed information 
is available in the narrative section of this Congressional Justification. 
Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (-$222.3 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. CDC funds 
approximately 30 separate disease and risk factor prevention grant programs to reduce the prevalence of 

chronic disease and the leading causes of death (e.g., alcohol use, nutrition, and stroke).  Many states receive a 

limited amount of resources per grant program, and in some instances, states receive less than $200,000 to 

address a specific prevention strategy.  The budget creates the new 

Block Grant to integrate 
existing disease-based activities into one block grant to increase flexibility to states, tribes, localities, and 

territories to more efficiently and effectively address the leading causes of death specific to each jurisdiction. 
At this level, CDC reduces or eliminates the following activities: 
Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (-$51.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community 
Health (REACH) program. The FY 2018 Budget integrates existing disease-based activities into a new 

block grant to increase flexibility to States and Tribes to more efficiently and effectively address the 

leading causes of death specific to each State.  State, local, or tribal recipients of the $500 million 


block grant will continue work on the leading causes of death and disability in these 

communities.  In FY 2016, CDC funded 49 governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations, 

including state and local health departments, American Indian Tribes/Tribal Organizations, universities, 

and community-based organizations. 
Prevention Research Centers (-$25.4 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the Prevention Research Center (PRC) program. This 
program works with academic institutions to conduct research and disseminate prevention 

interventions across United States. In FY 2016, CDC funded PRCs at 26 universities in 24 states to study 

how individuals and communities can avoid or counter the risks for chronic illnesses. For example, the 

PRCs funded Tulane University to research the strategy of creating bicycle lanes to increase physical 
activity in New Orleans. NIH also supports research on chronic diseases, including prevention research. 

effective existing interventions. 
Cancer Prevention and Control (-$18.1 million) 

The FY 2018 request reduces funding for the Cancer Prevention and Control program by $18.1 million. 
At this funding level, there is no dedicated funding for Colorectal, Prostate, and Skin Cancer.  Through 
the expanded Comprehensive Cancer program, CDC will support activities to more effectively address 
the overall risk factors associated with specific types of cancers. 
Epilepsy (-$8.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the Epilepsy program. Elimination of this program 


leading causes of death and disability. The Epilepsy Program works with national organizations and 

researchers to develop and share public education programs and campaigns and provide services for 
people with epilepsy.  In FY 2016, CDC funded the Epilepsy Foundation, which works with 44 state and 
 local chapters and several research cooperative agreements, including the Managing Epilepsy Well 
Network, which is currently comprised of eight Prevention Research Centers. 
Hospitals Promoting Breastfeeding (-$8.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates dedicated funding for the Hospitals Promoting Breastfeeding 
program. This program was created in FY 2012 and has been funded by the Prevention and Public Health 

Fund. This program promotes and supports evidence-based strategies in states, communities, and 

hospitals to help women who choose to breastfeed to start and continue breastfeeding. State, local, or 

tribal recipients of the 

block grant could continue to promote breastfeeding as a way 
to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes. 
National Lupus Patient Registry (-$6.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the National Lupus Patient Registry. This program 
supports lupus registries and related studies, raises awareness, educates patients and healthcare 
providers, and promotes interventions. In FY 2016, CDC funded follow-up studies focused on natural 
history, disparities, and healthcare access and treatment in three lupus registries. Elimination of this 


causes of death and disability. 
Million Hearts (-$4.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates dedicated funding for the Million HeartsÂ® program, which has 
previously been funded by the Prevention and Public Health Fund.  This program is a collaboration 

between CDC and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to enhance cardiovascular 

disease prevention activities across the public and private sector. In FY 2016, CDC funded three partner 

organizations
including the National Association of Community Health Centers and the YMCA of USA. 
CDC remains committed to maximizing its efficiency and public health impact. CDC will continue to 
enhance cardiovascular disease prevention through existing resources. 
National Early Child Care Collaboratives (-$4.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates dedicated funding for the National Early Child Care 
Collaboratives program, which has previously been funded by the Prevention and Public Health Fund. 

State, local, or tribal recipients of the 

block grant could continue to promote similar 
prevention activities in the Early Child Care and Education (ECE) setting as a way to prevent obesity. This 

program implements obesity prevention initiatives targeting ECE settings to help establish and improve 

the healthy nutrition and physical activity habits of young children. To carry out this work, CDC supports 
ECE learning collaboratives in nine states to facilitate best practices in nutrition, breastfeeding support, 
physical activity, and screen time.  
Health Promotion (-$10.5 million) 
The Budget eliminates funding for activities funded under Health Promotion.  This elimination also 

funded by the Other Chronic Disease program line. 
 HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections and Tuberculosis (-$186.1 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections and 
Tuberculosis by $186.1 million. At the FY 2018 requested amount, CDC will reduce activities around testing, 

support services for persons living with HIV, and prevention services. 

innovative demonstration projects or research examining strategies related to high impact prevention and new 

tools supporting HIV prevention will be reduced. CDC will focus its efforts on sustaining the declines that have 

been achieved and reaching those Americans who are at highest risk.  CDC will continue to work towards the 

national HIV/AIDS targets.   Although fewer HIV tests would be paid for directly with CDC Federal funds, Health 

Department capacity has increased to directly bill for testing HIV and related co-infections in health care 

settings.  
Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grants (-$160.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant 

allocated for categorical programs such as heart disease, diabetes, immunizations, and obesity, and many states 
did not receive funding from CDC to support prevention of chronic disease.  As indicated above, this budget 
request proposes a new, five-year block grant program, 

, which provides flexibility to grantees 
and focuses on the leading public health challenges faced by states, tribes, localitie
s, and territories. 
Occupational Safety and Health (-$138.5 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for occupational safety and health research by $138.5 million.  The 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) will continue to conduct research to reduce 

worker illness and injury, and to advance worker well-being.  In FY 2018, the research program will no
t continue 
to fund state and academic partners for conducting, translating, or evaluating research. 
Education and Research Centers (-$28.5 million) 
Originally created almost 50 years ago, the Education and Research Centers program directed funding to 
academic programs focusing on industrial hygiene, occupational health nursing, occupational medicine, 

and occupational safety. The majority of schools of public health include coursework and many 

academic institutions have developed specializations in these areas. The budget request would no 

longer direct Federal funding to support academic salaries, stipends, and tuition and fee 

reimbursements for occupational health professionals at universities. 
Public Health Preparedness and Response (-$136.3 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for Public Health Preparedness and Response by $136.3 million. At 
this level, CDC will eliminate the Academic Centers for Public Health Preparedness and reduce the level of 
funding for the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Cooperative Agreements. 
The Budget restructures HHS preparedness grants to direct resources to States with the greatest need and 
provide more innovative approaches.  In FY 2018, the PHEP cooperative agreement will gain efficiencies, address 
gaps, and incentivize innovation by incorporating a competitive component in addition to a risk-based 
component, and link awards with performance. 
At this level, CDC will focus on the Select Agent Program and mission critical activities.  In order to maintain the 
critical preparedness and response infrastructure, CDC will prioritize activities which address the largest needs.  
 Academic Centers for Public Health Preparedness (-$8.2 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the Academic Centers for Public Health 
Preparedness. Eliminating funding for these centers allows CDC to prioritize funding for state and local 

health departments through the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) cooperative agreement. 

CDC will continue to support evaluation of grantee activities and assessments such as the Operational 

Readiness Review and will use these analyses to inform training and guidance to the public health 
preparedness field. 
Immunization Program (-$
89.5 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for the Immunization Program by $89.5 million. In FY 2018, CDC 
will work collaboratively with its awardees and partners to sustain record-high childhood immunization 

coverage rates and ensure that all Americans have access to vaccines.  At this funding level, CDC will continue to 

provide funding to the 64 immunization awardees for state infrastructure awards and vaccine direct assistance, 

but at a reduced level. CDC will also continue providing technical assistance and laboratory support to states 
and local communities responding to vaccine-preventable disease investigations, including outbreaks, but at a 
reduced level. 
Global Health (-$76.3 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for global health activities by $76.3 million. The majority of the 



The reduction reflects the 

further focus funds on countries, populations, and programs where resources will 
have the greatest public health impact, optimize staffing and technical resources to address highest-priority 

global HIV needs, and ensure that ongoing activities are consistent with overall PEPFAR priorities and are lean, 
efficient, and effective.  CDC will focus its global immunization activities to continue progress toward polio 
eradication, as well as measles and rubella elimination in the countries with the highest disease burden. For 
Global Disease Detection and Other Programs, CDC will focus on the continued identification of highly infectious, 
rapidly spreading pathogens and maintain a ready response force to respond to global disease outbreaks that 
threaten to spillover national borders and threaten regional and international health security. 
Emerging and Zoonotic Infections (-$64.9 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for Emerging and Zoonotic Infections by $64.9 million. At this level, 
CDC will eliminate Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Prion Disease activities, and funding to support the on-going 

Antibiotic Resistance (AR) initiative is reduced.  With a reduction in funding of $22.7 million for AR in FY 2018, 

CDC will continue to work with state and local health departments to protect Americans from the growing threat 

of antibiotic resistance, but will focus resources on States with demonstrated performance and highest need, 
reducing investments in research. 
Prion Disease (-$6.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for Prion Disease activities.  Prion diseases are a group of 
rare brain diseases affecting humans and animals that are uniformly fatal. Prion activities have been 

proposed for elimination to focus surveillance and monitoring activities on a broader range of high 

consequence pathogens and emerging diseases. Public health preventive measures recently instituted 

by the USDA will further reduce the risk of exposure to the U.S. population from Prion diseases.  NIH 
also supports research on Prion diseases. 
 Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (-$5.4 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) activities. CFS 

works with states 
and experienced clinicians to develop tools to gather and analyze surveillance data and to educate 

clinicians and the public on the results of evidence-based studies. NIH has been funded to conduct 

biomedical research on CFS. In FY 2018, CFS activities are proposed for elimination, prioritizing funding 

to programs that support a broad range of diseases to maximize effectiveness in this limited-resource 
environment. 
Birth Defects, Developmental Disabilities, Disability and Health (-$35.4 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental 
Disabilities by $35.4 million.  At the proposed FY 2018 funding level, CDC will focus its birth defects and 

developmental disabilities portfolio 


Injury Prevention and Control (-$
19.5 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reflects the elimination of funding for the Elderly Falls and the Injury Control 
Research Centers. Within this total, CDC will continue its emphasis on Opioid Abuse and Overdose Prevention at 

$75.4 million. CDC will focus its injury prevention portfolio on core public health activities that protect Ame

health. 
Injury Control Research Centers (-$9.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the Injury Control Research Centers (ICRCs). CDC 
supported 10 ICRCs to conduct research and evaluation activities related to the health and economic 

impact of injury and violence as well as the improvement of injury prevention practices. Elimination of 

Elderly Falls (-$2.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for the Elderly Falls program. Other agencies across the 
U.S.
 government and other key stakeholders invest in research and prevention programs to address 
Elderly Falls, and the materials that CDC has developed to support clinicians who treat older patients at 
risk for falls will remain available. 
Public Health Scientific Services (-$30.7 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), as well as 
funds that support the public health workforce and surveillance/informatics.  At a reduced capacity, the 
platform supported by NCHS will continue to provide information on emerging issues of public health 
importance for CDC and HHS, such as the rise in drug overdose deaths. CDC will also reduce the number of 
trained disease detectives and rapid outbreak responders. 
Environmental Health (-$
60.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for Environmental Health $
60.0 million below the FY 2017 
Annualized CR level, which includes $35 million for lead prevention and safe water activities, available through 
FY 2018. The FY 2018 budget request eliminates funding for Climate and Health and the Amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis Registry
. CDC will focus its environmental health portfolio on core activities required to protect 

 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Registry (-$10.0 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request eliminates the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) registry and related 
research program.  NIH-funded research on ALS will continue.  External researchers may still use 

biospecimens previously obtained from the ALS biorepository.  The budget request would eliminate 

funding for 13 extramural researcher-initiated studies to explore the causes of ALS and potential risk 
factors and the registry. 
Climate Change (-$10.0 million) 
Elimination of the program would end direct funding to states regarding health effects of climate 
change. States will continue to have access to other funds that would allow them to prepare and 

respond to public health emergencies, including natural disasters and adverse weather events.  The FY 

2018 budget request would eliminate funding for 18 state and local health departments and six tribal 
and territorial organizations. 
Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (-$12.5 million) 
The FY 2018 budget request reduces funding for the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) 
by $12.5 million (17% reduction). This reduction will reduce the number of public health assessments and 
consultations that ATSDR will be able to conduct in response to community requests.
