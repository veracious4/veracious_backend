 Call in sick with flu, I get a call half an hour later that there is an important issue that needs my immediate attention, since I was the 1 man IT team and I could not fix the issue remotely I reluctantly agreed to come in.

 Have you been told that you snore?
 Due to your colouring, you look slightly hypoxic in this photo and your mouth is wide open suggesting that you may be struggling to breathe while sleeping.
 Being sleepy enough to fall asleep during the day may also be a sign of impaired sleep due to apnoea.
 I have a coworker (intern) who sleeps at his desk from 9-11 every morning.
 He apologized profusely and said it was super embarrassing.
 I told him it was ok, shit happens.
 That is what they are for, for when you are puking or shitting yourself.
 Hit a little too close to home.
 All we can tell is that they're employed.
 If you define success as employed at ~30 then shit, it might already be too late for you.
 Dress for the job you want!
 how can he sleep?
 How can he sleep!
 Bastards.
 I'm 28 and the average age in my office is probably mid 40's.
 :) Your coworkers will never let you live it down!
 I used to do stuff like this and I thought it was fairly normal.
 I nearly got fired because of it, and I went to the doctor.
 I had narcolepsy.
 If you are sure you don't have it, read this article.
 Most people's conception of narcolepsy is completely wrong.
 This is the most accurate description I've ever come across.
 (I know its Cracked, but I dare you to find a better first person account).
 That's always fun.
 How do you even sleep at night?
 Thought you would appreciate it.
 As a one time thing its hilarious, only a real issue if it keeps happening.
 We go home and laugh about it, you should too.
 It's the little silly shit like this that makes or breaks how I feel about a job.
 Down to earth coworkers make the work hours go by less painfully and sometimes almost pleasantly.
 Also recording internship?
 They got you good!
 Just don't make any other mistakes.
 I wish more companies gave a shit about getting good chairs.
 And asleep??
 I have the same one.
 How are you posting this postmortem?
 Thankfully nobody noticed.
 I have since started (ab)using caffeine.
 I know that I've never met any of them, and yet for some reason I also feel like I recognize all of them.
 This one guy fell asleep twice during in his.
 It's only 1.5 hours long!
 He ended up being an OK worker but he never made it out of his introductory period.
 We let him go after two months.
 He could not recover from that.
 The office building only has these tiny conference rooms where they cram 8 people or more in at a time for meetings.
 No windows, and they're always either freezing or hotter than hell.
 It's borderline impossible for me to sit in on these meetings where I have limited engagement and not start getting the nods.
 Note how everyone/thing on the left appears super white and off-color while everything on the right appears normal.
 Now look at OP's right arm.
 It's a little pale, sure, but no more so than one might expect of someone that works indoors.
 I'm old, I miss those days.
 Are you dead or do you never leave the house to get some sunshine?
 (Coke or Pepsi, it doesn't matter, same stuff) It's basically like a giant game of Jenga and some sick puzzle game that involves math.
 I did this for 7 years.
 This is a local disk, this is a network drive.
 Your volume is muted, your wifi is off, reboot etc.
 I never fell asleep but I thought I was doomed.
 I then realized why everyone in offices drinks coffee.
 Couple cups keeps me going.
 And you just get a cheeky picture?
 FML.
 \r\r(While I'm certain I didn't fall asleep, I can admit I probably looked tired and less than enthused because they weren't quite ready for me yet so they literally just had me sit and read the employee manual for five hours.
 Then they let me leave early and I got a call 15 mins later saying don't come back tomorrow.
 I smell a conspiracy!
 Sleepy dude is still sleeping, and the first thing he'll see when he wakes up is this thread.
 You're lucky your ass didn't get fired.
 And quit bragging.
 We don't care about how many people you beat for the job.
 I hope they give you a second chance.
 I call shenanigans on your name.
 Great pic though, good luck with the rest of your internship!
 All of it.
 It doesn't look unique; it looks desperate for attention.
 I fell asleep at my unpaid internship several times.
 They thought it was funny the first or second time, and did a similar thing.
 But after 5 or 6 more times I had a stern talking too.
 Driving home or to my day job or to school I was constantly struggling to keep myself awake at the wheel.
 I am lucky to be alive.
 Fuck those fucking slavers at PBS.
 They made us work in a closet so no one would see us doing non-union labor, and (of course) I never got the job after a year.
 I'm never interning again.
 Period.
 Do you have to go back in time to do your job?
 Time to fight.
 Maybe call it a night.
