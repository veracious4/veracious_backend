 Methods:           From November 1992 through October 1993, we recruited 476 children with asthma (age, four to nine years) from eight inner-city areas in the United States.
 Immediate hypersensitivity to cockroach, house-dust-mite, and cat allergens was measured by skin testing.
 We then measured major allergens of cockroach (Bla g 1), dust mites (Der p 1 and Der f 1), and cat dander (Fel d 1) in household dust using monoclonal-antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
 High levels of exposure were defined according to proposed thresholds for causing disease.
 Data on morbidity due to asthma were collected at base line and over a one-year period.
 Results:           Of the children, 36.8 percent were allergic to cockroach allergen, 34.9 percent to dust-mite allergen, and 22.7 percent to cat allergen.
 Among the children's bedrooms, 50.2 percent had high levels of cockroach allergen in dust, 9.7 percent had high levels of dust-mite allergen, and 12.6 percent had high levels of cat allergen.
