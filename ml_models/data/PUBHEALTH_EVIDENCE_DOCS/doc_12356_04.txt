38   4 OVERVIEW
  Effects on the Federal Budget
  CBO and JCT estimate that, over the 2017
-2026 period,
 enacting this legislation
 would 
reduce direct spending by $
1,0
22 billion and reduce revenues by $
701
 billion, for a net 
reduction 
of $
321
 billion in the deficit over that period (see Table 
1, at the end of this 
document)
:    The largest savings would come from reductions in outlays for Medicaid
Šspending on the program 
would decline 
in 2026 by 
26 
percent in comparison 
with
 what CBO pro
jects under current law
Šand from 
changes to
 the Affordable Care 
Act™s (ACA™s) subsidies for nongroup health insurance (see Figure 1). Those 
savings would be partially offset by 
the effects of 
other changes 
to the ACA™s 
provisions
 dealing with insurance 
coverage
: 
additional 
spending designed to 
reduce premiums and a
 reduction in revenues from repealing penalties on 
employers who do not offer insurance and on people who do not purchase 
insurance. 
   The largest 
increase
s in deficits 
would come from repealin
g or modifying tax 
provisions in the ACA that are not directly related to health insurance coverage
, including
 repealing a 
surtax on net investment income and
 repealing annual fees 
imposed on health insurers.
  Pay
-as
-you
-go procedures apply because enactin
g this legislation
 would affect direct 
spending and revenues. CBO and JCT estimate that enact
ment
 would not increase net 
direct spending or on
-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10
-year periods 
beginning in 2027. 
The agencies expect that saving
s, particularly 
from
 Medicaid, would 
continue to grow
, while the costs would be smaller because 
a rescinded
 tax on 
employee
s™ health insurance premiums and health plan benefits would be reinstated in 
2026. 
CBO has not completed an estimat
e of the potential
 impact of this
 legislation on 
discretionary spending, which would be subject to future appropriation action.
  Effects on Health Insurance Coverage
  CBO and JCT estimate that
, in 2018, 
15 million more people would
 be uninsured under 
this legislation
 than under current law
Šprimarily
 because the penalty
 for not having 
insurance would be eliminated
. The increase in the number of uninsured people relative 
to the number projected under current law would reach 
19 million
 in 2020 and 
22 million 
in 2026. 
In 
later years
, other changes in the legislation
Šlower
 spending on Medicaid and 
substantially smaller 
average
 subsid
ies
 for coverage in the nongroup
 market
Šwould 
also 
lead to increases in the number of people without health
 insurance
. By 2026, among 
people under age 65, enrollment in Medicaid would fall by 
about 
16 percent
 and 
an 
estimated 
49 million people would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would 
lack insurance that year under current law.
  5   6 Stability of the H
ealth Insurance Market
  Decisions about offering and purchasing health insurance depend on the stability of the 
health insurance market
Šthat is, on the proportion of people living in areas with 
participating insurers and on the likelihood of premiums™ not 
rising in an unsustainable 

spiral. The market for insurance purchased individually with premiums not based on 
one™s health status would be unstable if, for example, the people who wanted to buy 
coverage at any offered price would have average health care e
xpenditures so high that 
offering the insurance would be unprofitable.
 
 Under Current Law.
 Although premiums have been rising under current law, most 
subsidized enrollees purchasing health insurance coverage in the nongroup market are 

largely insulated fro
m increases in premiums because their out
-of-pocket payments for 
premiums are based on a percentage of their income; the government pays the difference 

between that percentage and the premiums for a reference plan
 (which is the second
-lowest
-cost plan in t
heir area providing specified benefits)
. The subsidies to purchase 
coverage, combined with the effects of the individual mandate, which requires most 

individuals to obtain insurance or pay a penalty, are anticipated to cause sufficient 
demand for insurance
 by enough people, including people with low health care 
expenditures, for the market to be stable in most areas.
  Nevertheless, 
a small number of people
 live in 
areas of the country 
that
 have limited 
participation by insurers in the nongroup
 market under current law. Several factors 
may
 lead insurers to withdraw from the market
Šincluding lack of profitability and substantial 
uncertainty about enforcement of the individual mandate and about future payments of 
the cost
-sharing subsidies to redu
ce out
-of-pocket payments for people who enroll in 
nongroup coverage through the marketplaces established by the ACA.
  Under This Legislation.
 CBO and JCT anticipate that, under 
this legislation
, nongroup 
insurance markets would continue to be stable in 
most parts of the country. Although 
substantial uncertainty about 
the effects of the new law
 could lead 
some 
insurers to 
withdraw from or not enter the nongroup market
 in some states
, several factors would 
bring about market stability in most states before 2
020. In the agencies™ view, those key 
factors include 
the following: 
subsidies to purchase insurance, which would maintain 

sufficient demand for insurance by people wi
th low health care expenditures; the 
appropriation of funds for cost
-sharing subsidies, w
hich would provide certainty about 
the availability of those funds;
 and 
additional federal funding provided 
to states 
and 
insurers
, which would lower premiums by reducing the costs to insurers of people with 
high health care expenditures.
  The agencies exp
ect that the nongroup market in 
most
 areas of the country would 
continue to be stable in 2020 and later years as well, including in some states that obtain 

waivers 
that would not have otherwise done so
. (Under current law and this legislation, 
states can a
pply for Section 1332 waivers to change the structure of subsidies for 
 7 nongroup coverage
; the specifications for essential health benefits 
[EHBs], which 
set the
 minimum standards for the benefits that insurance in the nongroup and small
-group 
markets must 
cover
; and o
ther related provisions of law.) Substantial federal funding to 
directly reduce premiums would be available through 202
1. Premium tax credits would 
continue to provide insulation from changes in premiums through 202
1 and in later years. 
Those f
actors would help 
attract 
enough 
relatively healthy people 
for the 
market
 in most 
areas of the country to be stable
, CBO and JCT anticipate
. That stability in most areas 
would occur
 even though the 
premium tax credits would be smaller
 in most cases than 
under current law and subsidies to reduce cost sharing
Šthe amount that consumers are 
required to pay out of pocket when they use health care services
Šwould be eliminated 
starting in 2020
.   In t
he agencies
™ assessment
, a small fraction 
of the population resides in areas in which
Šbecause of this legislation, at least for 
some of the 
years
 after 2019
Šno insurers would 
participate in the nongroup market or insurance would be offered only with very high 
premiums. Some sparsely populated area
s might have no nongroup insurance offered 
because the reductions in subsidies would lead fewer people to decide to purchase 
insurance
Šand markets with few purchasers are less profitable for insurers. I
nsurance 
covering 
certain 
services 
would 
become more e
xpensive
Šin some cases, extremely 
expensive
Šin some areas because the scope of the EHBs would be narrowed through 
waivers affecting close to half
 the population, CBO and JCT expect.
 In addition, the 
agencies anticipate that all insurance in the nongroup ma
rket would become very 
expensive for at least a short period of time for a small fraction 
of the population resid
ing in areas in which
 states™ implementation of waivers with major changes caused market 
disruption. 
  Effects on Premiums and Out
-of-Pocket Pa
yments
  The legislation would increase average premiums in the nongroup market prior to
 2020 
and lower average premiums thereafter, relative to projections under current law
, CBO 
and JCT estimate
. 
To arrive at those estimates
, the agencies
 examined how the
 legislation 
would affect the premium
s charged if people purchased a benchmark plan
 in the 
nongroup market
.   
In 2018 and 2019, under current law and under the leg
islation, the benchmark plan has
 an actuarial value of 70 percent
Šthat is, the insurance pays
 about 70 percent of the total 
cost of covered benefits, on average. In the marketplaces, such 
coverage
 is known as a 
silver plan. 
  Under th
e Senate
 bill, average premiums for benchmark plans 
for single individuals 
would be 
about 
20 percent higher in 2018
 than under current law, mainly because the 
penalty for not having insurance
 would be eliminated, inducing fewer comparatively 
healthy people to sign up
. Those premiums would be about 
10 percent higher
 than under 
current law
 in 2019
Šless than in 2018 in 
part because funding provided by the bill
 to 
 8 reduce premiums 
would affect
 pricing
 and because changes in the limits on how 
premiums can vary by age would result in a larger number of younger people paying 
lower premiums to purchase policies
.  In 2020, 
aver
age 
premiums for benchmark plans for single individuals would be about 
30 percent lower
 than under current law. A
 combination of factors would 
lead to that 
decrease
Šmost important, 
the smaller share of
 benefits
 paid for by the benchmark plan
s and 
federal f
unds provided to directly reduce premiums.
  That share of services covered by insurance would be 
smaller because the 
benchmark 
plan 
under this legislation 
would have an actuarial value 
of 
58 percent
 beginning in 2020
. That value is slightly below the actua
rial value 
of 
60 percent 
for
 ﬁbronzeﬂ
 plans 
currently 
offered in 
the 
marketplaces. 
Because of the ACA™s limits on out
-of-pocket spending and 
prohibitions on annual and lifetime limits on payments for services within the EHBs, all 
plans must pay for most of
 the cost of high
-cost services. To design a plan with an 
actuarial value of 60 percent or less and pay for those high
-cost services, insurers must 
set high
 deductibles
Šthat is, the amount
s that pe
ople
 pay out
 of pocket for most types of 
health care servic
es before insurance makes any contribution. Under current law
 for a 
single policyholder in 2017
, the average deductible (for medical and drug expenses
 combined
) is about $6,000
 for a bronze plan and $3
,600 for a silver plan
. CBO and JCT 
expect that the 
benchmark plans under this legislation would have high deductibles
 similar to 
those for 
the bronze plans offered under current law
. Premiums for a
 plan with 
an actuarial value of 58 percent 
are
 lower than 
they are for 
a plan with an actuarial value 
of 70
 percent (the value 
for the reference plan 
under current law) largely because
 the 
insurance
 pays for a smaller average share of 
health care costs
.  Although the average benchmark premium directly affects the amount of premium tax 

credits and is a key element in CBO™s analysis of the budgetary effects of the bill, it does 
not represent the effect of this legislation on the average premiums for all 
plan
s purchased
. The differences in the actuarial value of plans purchased under this legislation 
and under current law would be greater starting in 2020
Šwhen, for example, under this 
bill, some people w
ould 
pay more than the benchmark premium to 
purchase a si
lver plan
, whereas, under current law, others would pay less than the benchmark premium to 
purchase 
a bronze plan. 
  
Under this legislation, starting in 2020, the premium for a silver plan would typically be a 
relatively high percentage of income for low
-income people
. The deductible for a plan 
with an actuarial value of 58 percent would be a significantly higher percentage of 
income
Šalso 
making 
such a plan
 unattractive, but for a different reason
. As a result, 
despite being eligible for premium tax credits
, few low
-income people would purchase 
any plan
, CBO and JCT estimate
.  9  By 2026, average 
premiums for benchmark plans for single individuals in most of the 
country 
under this
 legislation would be about 20
 percent lower than under current law, 
CBO and JCT e
stimate
Ša smaller decrease than in 2020
 largely because federal funding 
to reduce premiums would have lessened. The estimates for both of those years 

encompass effects
 in 
different areas of the country
 that would be substantially higher and 
substantially lower than the average effect nationally, in part because of the effects of 

state waivers. Some small fraction of the population is not included in those estimates. 
CBO and JCT expect that those people 
would be in states using waivers in such a way 
that
 no benchmark plan would be defined. Hence, a comparison of benchmark premiums 
is not possible in such areas.
  Some people enrolled in nongroup insurance would experience substantial increases in 
what they
 would spend on health care
 even though 
benchmark premiums would decline, 
on average, in 2020 and later years
. Because nongroup insurance 
would 
pay for a smaller 
average share of benefits under th
is legislation, most people purchasing it 
would have 
higher 
out
-of-pocket spending on health care than under current law.
 Out
-of-pocket 
spending would also be affected for the people
Šclose to half the population, CBO and 
JCT expect
Šliving in states modifying the EHBs
 using waivers. People
 who used 
services or benef
its no longer included in the EHBs would experience substantial 

increases in 
supplemental premiums or 
out-of-pocket spending on health care
, or would 
choose to forgo the services. Moreover, the ACA™s ban on annual and lifetime limits on 

covered benefits wo
uld no longer apply to health benefits not defined as essential in a 
state. As a result, for some benefits that might be removed from a state™s definition of 

EHBs but that might not be excluded from insurance coverage altogether, some enrollees 
could see l
arge increases in out
-of-pocket spending because annual or lifetime limits 
would be allowed. 
   Uncertainty Surrounding the Estimates
  CBO and JCT have endeavored to develop budgetary estimates that are in the middle of 
the distribution of potential outcom
es. Such estimates are inherently 
inexact
 because the 
ways in which federal agencies, states, insurers, employers, individuals, doctors, 
hospitals, and other affected parties would re
spond to the changes made by this
 legislation are all difficult to predict. 
In particular
, predicting the overall effects of the 

myriad ways that states could implement
 waivers is especially difficult.
  
CBO and JCT™s projections under current law itself are 
also 
uncertain
. For example, 
en
rollment in the marketplaces under current law 
will probably 
be lo
wer than wa
s projected
 under the March 2016 baseline used in this analysis
, which would tend to 
decre
ase the budgetary savings 
from
 this
 legislation. 
However
, the average subsidy per 
enrolle
e under current law 
will probably be higher than wa
s projected
 in March 2016
, which would tend to increase the budgetary savings 
from
 th
is
 legislation.
 (For 
a 
related 
discussion, see the section on ﬁUse of the March 2016 Baselineﬂ on page 
15.)  10  Despite the
 uncertainty, the dir
ection of certain effects of this
 legislation is clear. For 
example, the amount of federal revenues collected and the amount of spending on 

Medicaid would almost surely both be lower than under current law. And the numb
er of 
uninsured 
people under this
 legislation would almost surely be greater than under current 
law.
  Intergovernmental and Private
-Sector Mandates
  CBO has reviewed the nontax provisions of the legislation and determined that they 
would impose intergovernmental mandates 
as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform 
Act (UMRA) by preempting state laws. Although the preemptions would limit the 
application of state laws, they would impose no duty on states that would result in 
additional spending or a loss of revenue
s. JCT has 
determined that the tax provisions of 
the legislation contain no intergovernmental mandates.
 
 JCT and CBO have determined that the legislation would impose private
-sector mandates 
as defined in UMRA. On the basis of information from JCT, CBO estimates
 that
 the 
aggregate cost of the mandates would exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA 
for private
-sector mandates ($156 million in 2017, adjusted annually for inflation).
  
 MAJOR PROVISIONS OF 
THIS LEGIS
LATION
  Under this legislation, b
udgetary effects
 related to health insurance coverage would stem 
from provisions that became effective in different years. 
  
Upon enactment, 
th
e legislation
 would eliminate penalties associated with the 
requirements that most people obtain health insurance coverage and th
at large employers 
offer their employees coverage that meets specified standards. States would be allowed to 
meet fewer criteria to 
waive the ACA™s requirement establishing essential health benefits 
and many other requirements related to subsidies and the 
marketplaces as long as the 
changes would not increase federal deficits
; states would be
 provided funding to develop 
applications for waivers. 
  In 2018, the 
legislation
 would pro
vide funding to health insurers
 to stabilize premiums 
and promote participati
on in 
the 
marketplaces.
  In 2019, f
our major coverage provisions would 
take effect
:   Appropriating funding for grants to states through the 
Long
-Term 
State 
Stability 
and Innovation 
Program.
   11  Requiring insurers to impose a six
-month waiting period before co
verage starts for 
people who enroll in insurance in the nongroup market if they have been 
uninsured for more than 63 days within the past year.
   Setting a 
limit
 whereby 
insurers w
ould charge 
older people 
premiums
 that are
 up to 
five times 
higher 
than 
those charged 
younger 
people
 in the nongroup and small
-group markets
, unless a state sets a different limit.
   Removing the federal cap on the share of premiums that may go to insurers™ 
administrative costs and profits 
(also known as 
the 
minimum 
medical 
loss ratio 
requirement
) and 
effectively 
allowing
 each 
state to 
set its own 
cap.
  In 2020, the following a
dditional major coverage provisions would 
take effect
:   Changing the tax credit for health insurance coverage purchased through the 

nongroup market and r
epealing current
-law subsidies to reduce cost
-sharing 
payments
. People with income below 100
 percent of the 
federal poverty 
level
 (FPL) 
who are not eligible for Medicaid
 would be
come
 eligible
 for the tax credit, 
and p
eople with income between 350
 percent 
and 400
 percent of the FPL would 
no longer
 be eligible. T
he 
maximum 
percentage of income 
specified by the bill 
that people would pay at different ages
 toward the purchase of a benchmark plan 
would be lower for some younger people and higher for some older 
people
. The 
benchmark plan 
used to determine the amount of the tax credit 
would have
 a lower 
actuarial value
.   Capping the growth in per
-enrollee payments for 
nondisabled
 children and 
nondisabled adults enrolled in Medicaid at no more than the medical care
 component of the consumer price index (CPI
-M) and for most enrollees who are 
disabled 
adults 
or age 65 or older 
at no more than 
the 
CPI-M plus 1 percentage 
point, starting in 2020
 and going through 2024. 
Starting in 2025, t
he rate of 
growth in per
-enrollee payments for all groups would 
be pegged to
 the consumer 
price index for all urban consumers (CPI
-U).  Starting i
n 2021, the bill would r
educ
e the federal matching rate for
 funding for
 adults 
made eligible for Medicaid by the ACA; that rate would 
decline 5 percent
age points per 
year through
 2023 and then fall to equal the rate for other enrollees in 
a state in later 
years.
  Other parts of 
this legis
lation would repeal or delay many of t
he changes the ACA made 
to the Internal Revenue Code that were not directly related to the law™s insurance 
coverage provisions. Those with the largest budgetary effects include
 these:
   Repealing the surtax on certain high
-income taxpayers™ net investment i
ncome
, effective 
for 
tax year
s beginning after December 2016
.  12   Repealing the annual fee on health insurance providers
, beginning 
in calendar year
 2017.
   Delaying when the excise tax imposed on some health insurance plans with high 
premiums would go into ef
fect
. It is currently scheduled to take effect 
for
 tax year
s beginning after December 2019
; the legislation would delay the effective date for 
six years
.   Repealing the increase in the Hospital Insurance payroll tax rate for certain high
-income taxpayers
, effective for 
earned income 
received 
beginning in
 2023
.   In addition, 
this legis
lation would make several changes to other health
-related programs 
that would have smaller budgetary effects.
   ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
  CBO and JCT estimat
e that, on net, enacting 
this legis
lation would decrease federal 
deficits by $
321 billion over the 2017
-2026 period. The largest budgetary effects would 
stem from provisions affecting insurance coverage. Those provisions, taken together, 
would reduce proje
cted deficits by $
862
 billion over the 2017
-2026 period. Other 
provisions would increase deficits by $
541
 billion, mostly by reducing tax revenues. (See 
Table 
2, at the end of this document, for the estimated budgetary effects of each major 
provision.)
 The largest effects on spending under this bill would be for Medicaid. 
Overall, including 
all provisions
 affecting Medicaid
, CBO es
timates that spending 
for
 the 
program 
would be reduced by $160 billion in 2026 
compared 
with
 projections u
nder 
current law (see 
Figure 2
).    13  Budgetary Effects of Health Insurance Coverage Provisions
  The total deficit reduction 
that would result from the insurance coverage provisions 
includes the fol
lowing amounts (shown in Table
 3, at the end of this document):
   A reduction of $
772 billion in federal outlays for Medicaid;
   Savings of $
424 billion stemming mainly from 
modifying
, in 2020,
 the ACA™s
 tax 
credits for premium assistance 
to purchase nongroup health insurance 
and
, in the 
same year,
 eliminating 
subsidies to reduce cost
-sharing payments;
   Savings of $
21 billion, mostly associated with shifts in the mix of taxable and 
nontaxable compensation
Šresulting in more taxable income
Šfrom net decreases 
in most years in the number of people estimated to enroll in employment
-based 
health insurance coverage; and
   Savings of $
6 billion from repealing a tax credit for certain small employers who 
provide health insurance to their employees.
     14 Those decreases in the deficit would be partially offset by:
   A reduction in revenues of $
210
 billion from eliminating the penalties paid by 
uninsured people ($
38 billion) and employers ($
171 billion);
   An increase in spending of $
107
 billion 
for s
hort
-term assistance 
to insurers 
to 
address 
disrupted 
coverage and access and 
to 
provide support for 
states
 through
 the 
Long
-Term 
State 
Stability and Innovation 
Program; and
   A net increase in spending of $
42 billion for the Medicare program stemming 
from changes in payments to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low
-income patients.
  Revenue
 Effects of Other Provisions
  JCT estimates that 
this legis
lation would reduce revenues by $
563 bill
ion over the 
2017
-2026 period by repealing many of the revenue
-related provisions of the ACA (apart 
from those 
directly 
related to health insurance coverage
, which are
 discussed above). 
  Direct Spending Effects of Other Provisions
  This legis
lation would also make changes to spending 
apart from those 
directly 
related to

verage 
(which are 
discussed above
), such as 
eliminating 
funds for 
grant
s provided 
through
 the Prevention and Public Health Fund
. CBO and JCT estimate 
that those provisions would 
reduce
 direct spending
, on net, by about $
22 billion over the 
2017
-2026 period

  CBO has not completed an estimate of the potential impact of 
this legis
lation on 
discretionary spending, which would be subject to future appropriation action.
   
BASIS OF ESTIMATE
  For this cost estimate, CBO and JCT assume that 
the
 legis
lation will be ena
cted by 
July
 31, 2017
, and use
 CBO™s
 March 2016 baseline
. The agencies
 have 
provided an 
overall estimate of the budgetary effects of the coverage provisions 
in
 this legislation
, and 
not 
separate estimates
 for each
 provision
, for three related reasons
. First, t
he agencies™
 modeling is done in an integrated way
. Second,
 there are important interactions 
among
 the 
provisions
, so
 the sum of the parts (when 
considered
 separate
ly) does not equal the 
whole
. Third,
 the order in which the 
provisions
 are considere
d would 
matter.
 For t
he 
noncoverage spending provisions
, the agencies
 have 
done separate
 estimate
s. Various 
publications by JCT have provided considerable information about the basis of 
earlier
  15 estimates 
for noncoverage revenue provisions 
that remains appl
icable
, and those 
provisions are not discussed further in this document
.1  Use of the March 2016 Baseline
  On the basis of consultation with the budget committees, CBO and JCT measured the 
costs and savings in this estimate relative to CBO™s March 2016 
baseline projections, 
with adjustments for legislation that was enacted after that baseline was produced. That 
approach is not unusual
: The budgetary effects of reconciliation legislation are typically 
estimated relative to the baseline that underlies t
he 
budget resolution that specifi
ed the 
reconciliation instructions and that was the basis for the deficit reduction goals stated in 
the resolution. 
The March 2016 baseline has been used by CBO and JCT for cost 
estimates 
for
 all 
pieces of 
legislation related 
to the budget reconciliation process for 2017
, including this one.
   CBO
™s most recent baseline projection
s were
 completed
 in 
late 
January 2017
, after the 
budget resolution was adopted
. The agencies 
have 
not 
had time to undertake a
 follow
-on analysis of th
e effects of this legislation under 
that baseline.
  
In the projections published in January 2017
, the direct spending and revenue effects of 
the 
ACA™s 
insurance coverage provisions
 and the total number of people projected to be 
uninsured 
were similar to th
ose in the March 2016 baseline, but the number of people 
projected to purchase subsidized coverage in 
the 
marketplaces was smaller
, and the 
average subsidy per person was larger. If this legislation was evaluated relative to the 
January 2017 baseline rathe
r than the March 2016 baseline, it is unclear 
how different 
categories of insurance would be affected and 
whether the budgetary effects would differ
 
noticeably
.   Health Insurance

about 
overall effects
 to

overview
, this section describes
 the methodology used to estimate the effects of th
e 
coverage provisions
. Then, it
 provides additional details about each of the major coverage 
provisions identified above, in the order in w
hich they would become effective, and

specific 
effects.

  16 Additional Information About 
Overall Effects
. CBO and JCT expect that this
 legislation would increase the number of uninsured 
people substantially. T
he increase 
would be
 disproportion
ately larger among older people with lower income
Šparticular
ly
 people
 between 50 and 64 years old with income of less than 200
 percent of the 
federal 
poverty level 
(see Figure 
3). This section provides additional information about two 
major sources of coverage as well as about stability of the health insurance market.
  Medicaid. 
Enrollment 
in Medicaid 
would be lower throughout the coming decade
, with
 15 million fewer Medicaid enro
llees by 2026
 than projected under current law
 in CBO™s 
March 2016 baseline
 (see Figure 
4). Some of that decline would be among people who 
are
 currently eligible for Medicaid benefits, and some would be among people who CBO
 projects would
, under current la
w, 
become e
ligible in the future 
as additional states 
adopt
ed the ACA™s option
 to expand
 eligibility.
    17  Nongroup coverage. 
On net, 
CBO and JCT estimate that
 roughly 
7 million fewer people 
would obtain coverage 
in 2018 
through the nongroup market 
under this legislation 
than 
under 
current law; that figure would be about 
9 million in 2020
 and about 
7 million in 
2026
 (see Table
 4, at the end of this document
). Fewer people would enroll in the 
nongroup market 
mainly 
because 
the penalty for not having i
nsurance would be 
eliminated and, starting in 2020, because 
the average subsidy for coverage in that market 
would be substantially lower for 
most 
people currently eligible for subsidies
Šand for 
some people that subsidy would be eliminated
.   Market Stabili
ty. 
In C
BO and JCT
™s 
assessment
, a small fraction 
of the population resides 
in areas in which
Šbecause of this legislation, for at least for some of the years after 
2019
Šno insurers would participate in the nongroup market or insurance w
ould be
 offered 
only 
with very high premiums. In the first case, the elimination of cost
-sharing 
subsidies for low
-income people and the greater share of income that older people pay 
toward premiums would shrink 
the 
demand for insurance compar
ed with that under
 current la
w, and it would 
probably 
not be profitable for insurers to bear the fixed costs of
 operating in some markets. In the second case, because the total subsidy per person under 
the legislation 
would be
 substantially smaller than under current law, the fraction
 of 
purchasers who are subsidized would fall. Among the unsubsidized population, less 

healthy people are more likely to purchase insurance
Šand
 the higher costs 
for them 
 18 would 
put upward pressure on premiums. As unsubsidized people bec
ame a greater 
fraction
 of the purchasers, that pressure would 
be greater 
and could result in very high 
premiums in some markets
Šmainly during the second half of the coming decade, when 
much less federal funding 
would be 
provided to reduce premiums
. In 
both
 cases, 
instability in
 a given market would probably be resolved within a few years
 by state
s™ actions
: States could 
obtain a waiver that would allow changes to 
certain 
market 
regulations
 for the purpose of reducing premiums
; 
they
 could reduce premiums directly 
using funding ob
tained 
through the waiver process;
 they
 could obtain a greater share of 
the funding from the State Stability and Innovation Program
 to directly reduce premiums
; 
and 
they
 could spend their own funds to directly 
lower 
premiums
.  Methodology
. This legislation would change the pricing of nongroup insurance and the 
eligibility for and the amount of subsidies to purchase that insurance. It would also lead 
to changes in 
eligibility for 
Medicaid and per capita spending
 in that program
. The legis
lati
on™s effects on health insurance coverage would depend in part on how 
individuals 
responded
 to changes in the prices, after subsidies, they ha
d to pay for 
nongroup insurance; on changes in their eligibility for public coverage; and on their 
underlying desi
re for such insurance. Effects on coverage would also stem from how 
businesses
 responded
 to changes in those prices 
for nongroup insurance 
and in the 
attractiveness of other aspects of nongroup alternatives to employment
-based insurance.
  To capture those 
complex interactions, CBO uses a microsimulation model to estimate 
how rates of coverage and sources of insurance would change as a result of alterations in 

eligibility and subsidies for
Šand thus the net cost of
Švarious insurance options. Based 
on survey d
ata, that model incorporates a wide range of information about a 
representative sample of individuals and families, including their income, employment, 
health status, and health insurance coverage. The model also incorporates information 

from the research 
literature about the responsiveness of individuals and employers to 
price changes and the responsiveness of individuals to changes in eligibility for public 
coverage. CBO regularly updates the model so that it incorporates information from the 
most recent 
administrative data on insurance coverage and premiums. CBO and JCT use 
that model
Šin combination with models 
to project
 tax revenues, models of spending and 
actions by states, projections of trends in early retirees™ health insurance coverage, and 
other a
vailable information
Što inform their estimates of the numbers of people with 
certain types of coverage and the associated federal budgetary costs.
2  Mandate Penalties
. This legislation would
, upon enactment,
 eliminate
 penalties 
associated with 
requirements that most people obtain health insurance coverage (also 
called the individual mandate) and that large employers offer their employees health 
insurance coverage that meets specified standards (also called the employer mandate). 
As 
                                              2. For additional information, see Congressional Budget Office, ﬁMethods for Analyzing Health Insura
nce 
Coverageﬂ (accessed June 
25, 2017), 
www.cbo.gov/topics/health
-care/methods
-analyzing
-health
-insurance
-coverage
.   19 a result, 
few
er people 
would 
enroll in health insurance obtained through the nongroup 
market, in employment
-based health insurance 
coverage, and
 in Medicaid
. The estimated 
savings 
from the reduced subsidies 
stemming from 
such lower enrollment 
would exceed 
the estimated
 loss of revenues from eliminating 
the 
mandate penalties.
  Nongroup 
Coverage. 
In the nongroup market, some people would choose not to have 
insurance because they choose to be covered by insurance under current law to avoid 

paying the penalties. And
, under 
this legislation,
 without the mandate penalties, 
some 
people would forgo insurance in response to the higher premiums that CBO
 and JCT 
project
 would 
be charged
. Insurers would still be required to provide coverage to any 
applicant, 
and they 
would not be 
able to vary premiums to reflect enrollees™ health status 
or to limit coverage of preexisting medical conditions. Those features are most attractive 
to applicants with relatively high expected costs for health care, so CBO and JCT expect 
that repealing the
 individual mandate penalt
y would tend to reduce insurance coverage 
less among older and less healthy people than among younger and healthier people. Thus, 

the agencies estimate that repealing th
at
 penalt
y, taken by itself, would increase 
premiums
 in the n
ongroup market
.  Employment
-Based 
Coverage.
 Under current law, the prospect of paying 
the 
employer 
mandate penalt
y tips the scale for some 
businesses
 and causes them to decide to offer 
health insurance to their employees. Thus, eliminatin
g th
at
 penalt
y wou
ld cause some 
employers to not offer health insurance. 
Similarly, the demand for insurance among 
employees is 
great
er under current law because 
some employees want employment
-based 
coverage so that they can avoid paying 
the 
individual man
date penalt
y. Elim
inating th
at
 penalt
y would 
reduce such demand and would cause some employers to not offer 
coverage
 or some employees 
to 
not enroll in coverage they were offered
, CBO and JCT 
estimate
.  Medicaid. 
Under current law, the penalt
y associated with the individual mandate appl
ies 
to some Medicaid
-eligible adults and children. (For example,
 it appl
ies
 to single 
individuals with income above about 90 percent of the FPL.) In addition, some people 
apply for coverage in the marketplaces be
cause of the penalt
y and turn out to be eligible 
for Medicaid. And some who are not subject to the penalt
y think they would be if they 
did not enroll in Medicaid. 
  The agencies do not expect 
that, with the penalty eliminated under this legislation, 
people
 enrolled in Medicaid would disenroll. However, a
mong people who w
ould
 become 
eligible for Medicaid 
under th
e legislation
 or who w
ould
 need to recertify their eligibility, 
the proportion of people who enroll in the program 
would, by CBO and JCT™s 
expectati
ons, be lower
Šcloser to the proportions observed for those groups prior to the 
institution of the 
penalty
.   Waivers
. This legislation would alter the way that states may waive certain provisions of 
the ACA by making the approval process quicker, more 
flexible, and less stringent
Š 20 which would result in a broader set of changes, CBO and JCT expect
. Under current law 
and this legislation, states can apply for Section 1332 waivers to change the premium tax 
credits, the definition of essential health benefit
s, and certain other provisions of law 
affecting health insurance. 
  According to this legislation, a waiver shall be granted if the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) and
, if the waiver affects premium tax credits,
 the Secretary of 
the Treasury
, determine that it would not increase the federal deficit. Three requirements 
for waivers to be approved under current law would be eliminated: that waiver programs 
provide health insurance coverage to a comparable number of state residents, that they 
meet
 requirements for
 out-of-pocket spending, and that 
coverage 
is at least as 
comprehensive as the 
federal
 EHBs
. As under current law, however, states could not use 
waivers to change federal 
regulations 
relating to preexisting conditions, requiring
 insurers 
to offer
 coverage to a
ny applicant,
 or requiring that 
premiums 
in the nongroup market not 
be 
based on an individual™s health 
(allowing them
 to 
vary only on the basis of age, 
smoking status,
 and geographic location
). In addition, under the legislation, state
s could 
not use waivers to change regulations related to continuous coverage. 
 
 Under th
is legislation (as under current law), states could apply to receive funds that 
would have been provided to their residents in the absence of a waiver that has been 
gra
nted. For example, Hawaii is projected to receive about $3 million of such ﬁpass
-throughﬂ funds over the next five years under the only waiver approved so far. Those 

funds will be used to reduce premiums for employees of small businesses in lieu of 
having 
the state™s small businesses be eligible for federal tax credits. 
  CBO and JCT expect that, over the 2017
-2026 period, under current law, some states will 
receive waivers, and under this legislation, more would. The agencies expect that states 
would pursu
e additional waivers for various reasons
Što obtain more funding than their 
residents would otherwise receive, to lower premiums, and to reduce cost sharing, for 

example. Some 
of 
those waivers would also be used to counteract ins
tability arising 
under the b
ill.
 However, CBO and JCT 
anticipate 
that, to avoid administering the 
premium tax credits themselves, few states would make significant changes to the credits
. (The agencies expect that the Internal Revenue Service would administer federal tax 

credits
, but
 would not administer different state credits.) 
For the same reason, the 
agencies expect that few states would
 change market regulations 
in 
such 
a way 
that no 
benchmark plan was available to use in calculating the credit amounts
Šwhich would 
occur if the EHBs were not well defined. 
 
 As a result of the additional waivers stemming from this bill, the agencies expect that 
about half the population would be 
in states receiving substantial additional pass
-through 
funding. Compared with what would occur under this bi
ll without additional waivers, 
federal deficits would increase and the number of people with health insurance coverage 

would be about the same, acc
ording to CBO and JCT™s estimates. Additional waivers 
would probably cause market instability
 in some areas
, in addition to being used to 
 21 counteract instability
 in others
. Average premiums for benchmark plans would be lower
 in most states that obtain waive
rs.  Effects on the Budget.
 Any savings projected by the Administration 
to
 result from 
waiver
s would be provided to 
state
s as pass
-through funding 
to be used for approved 
purposes
. Hence, waivers would have no effect on the federal deficit if the 
Administr
ation™s projections of savings were accurate
.   To estimate the effects of additional waivers on the federal budget, CBO and JCT first 
projected this bill™s effects without additional waivers. Then, the agencies adjusted those 
projections 
to reflect the 
likelihood that the additional waivers would not be deficit 
neutral in practice
. 
  According to CBO and JCT
™s estimates, in total, by 2026, about one
-fifth of the subsidies 
for nongroup coverage that would have been provided without the additional waivers 

would instead be provided as pass
-through funds to states. A small portion of the 
population would be in states that decided to fully administer their own system and 
receive the entire amount of their projected subsidies as pass
-through funding. In other 
cases, states would rely on the federal government to administer premium tax credits and 
would receive pass
-through funding related to incremental reductions in federal costs 
projected under
 the waivers. 
As an illustration, if the Administration projected t
hat a state 
using a waiver to narrow the scope of its EHBs would reduce the premium tax credits of 

its residents by 10 percent, then the state would receive that amount in pass
-through 
funding.
  This legislation, with its less stringent approval process, w
ould facilitate the approval of 
some waiver applications that have already been submitted and would boost the number 
of new requests and approvals. CBO and JCT analyzed the budgetary effects of those two 
cases separately. In both cases, the agencies expect
 that the process used to determine the 
amount of pass
-through funds would cause deficits to increase compared with what 
would have occurred without the additional waivers.
  States with an already
-submitted waiver request would, if it was approved under th
is legislation, receive pass
-through funds based on the difference between projected federal 
costs under the waiver (which would be calculated using current
-law subsidies available 
at the time the waiver application was submitted) and projected federal cos
ts under 
current law. Because current
-law subsidies are larger in most cases than the subsidies 
under this legislation, pass
-through funding for an already
-submitted waiver would 
generally be larger than the subsidies the residents of those states would re
ceive under 
this bill.
  
A waiver application not already submitted would engender pass
-through funding based 
on projections of federal costs under this bill with and without the waiver. States would 

have an incentive to be optimistic in their estimates of 
savings
Šwith projections of 
 22 federal costs without the waiver that were high and state costs with the waiver that were 
low. Particularly during the next few years, the Administration would not have enough 
data about experience under this legislation to full
y adjust for that incentive, CBO and 
JCT anticipate. After a few years, however, additional waivers would probably result in 
pass
-through funding amounts only slightly above what would have been spent without 
them. 
  Effects on Health Insurance Coverage. 
CBO and JCT estimate that the additional waivers 
would have little effect on the number of people insured, on net, by 2026. In the 

agencies
™ assessment, the effect would be minimal in many cases, larger and positive in 
some cases, and substantially negative
 in a few cases. The range of potential changes 
under those waivers is broad, and the following discussion describes only a few 
possibilities.
  The agencies expect that 
most
 of the population affected by additional waivers would be 
in states that narrow th
e scope of the EHBs. That change would directly lower premiums 
in the nongroup market, on average, and result in savings from 
reduced 
federal subsidies 
that states would receive as pass
-through funds. 
  In some of those cases in which states changed the EH
Bs, the pass
-through funds would 
be used to lower premiums further. 
As a result of the lower premiums, t
he number of 
unsubsidized people who would become insured in the nongroup market would increase. 
However, that increase would be roughly offset by decre
ases in employment
-based 
coverage and 
subsidized coverage
 in the nongroup market
. Some employers would 
respond over time to the presence of lower
-premium plans in the nongroup market by not 
offering coverage. People eligible for subsidies in the nongroup m
arket 
would receive 
little benefit from the lower premiums
, and 
many 
would therefore decline to 
purchase a 
plan providing fewer benefits
.   
In other cases in which the EHBs were changed, those pass
-through funds would be used 
to attract relatively healthy 
low-income people to purchase subsidized plans by covering 
certain services with low or no copayments. That approach would increase the number of 
people with insurance coverage
 and prevent or mitigate market instability
, although the 
effect would be limite
d by the amount of funds 
available 
to reduce cost sharing. 
  A small 
fraction 
of the population
 affected by additional waivers, CBO and JCT 
anticipate, would be in states 
where waivers 
substantially 
reduce the number of people 
insured. That reduction would
 occur if a state changed the structure of the subsidies for 
health insurance so that they provided 
a greater share of 
assistance to people who would 
have bought health insurance without 
subsidies
. Alternatively, such a reduction would 
occur if a state red
uced subsidies, received pass
-through funds, and used those funds for 
purposes other than health insurance coverage.
    23 Effects on Market Stability. 
Because a
 large portion of the population affected by 
additional waivers would be in states that narrow the 
scope of the EHBs
, CBO and JCT 
expect 
insurance 
covering certain services to 
become 
more expensive
Šin some cases, 
extremely expensive. For example, if the EHBs were modified to drop coverage of 
services 
that have high costs and 
are used by 
few people, 
cove
rage for maternity care, 
mental health care, 
rehabilitative and 
habilitative treatment, and certain very expensive 
drugs
 could be at risk
. Such modifications would lower premiums for many people and 
increase the number of people with coverage for a narrowe
r set of benefits. But, on the 
basis of historical experience, CBO and JCT anticipate that the funding available to help 
provide coverage for those high
-cost 
services
 would be insufficient in some cases even if 
a special program was designed for that purpo
se. Therefore, the agencies expect that 
insurance coverage for high
-cost 
services 
would become extremely expensive in those 
areas, as it was in some places before the enactment of the ACA in 2010. A state is 

required to have mechanisms to reduce the chance
 of such outcomes as part of its waiver 
program under current law, but would not be under this legislation.
 
 Some states could use waivers to administer their own system and make 
broad 
changes to 
the rules governing the nongroup market, affecting 
some 
small 
fraction 
of the population. 
The effects of such changes would be hard to predict, and premiums in the nongroup 
market could be very expensive for at least a short period of time.
  Effects on Premiums and Out
-of-Pocket Costs.
 The narrowing of the scop
e of the EHBs 
that CBO and JCT expect would 
result from
 additional waivers would directly lower the 
premiums for benchmark plans, as discussed above. Those declines would occur because 
the plans would cover fewer services
Šreducing both expenditures by insu
rers and the 
cost of bearing the risk that expenditures could be higher than insurers anticipate. States 

would probably also reduce premiums by 
using 
some pass
-through funding 
to
 mak
e payments to insurers.
     However, o
ut-of-pocket costs would increase if
 the scope of the EHBs w
as
 narrowed, as 
discussed above. If pass
-through funding for the additional waivers was used to reduce 
cost sharing, out
-of-pocket costs would decrease for people receiving that assistance
.  
Short
-Term Assistance to Address 
Disrupte
d Coverage and Access
. This legislation 
would 
provide a total of $50 billion 
to fund arrangements 
between the federal 
government and 
health insur
ers to address 
instances where 
coverage and access
 have 
been 
disrupt
ed
 and 
to 
respond to urgent health care 
needs.
 CBO and JCT expect 
virtually
 all of these funds
Š$15 billion per year in 2018 and 2019 and $10 billion per year in 
2020 and 2021
Što be used to reduce
 premiums for plans offered in the 
nongroup 
market, 
increasing enrollment in them
, primarily by peopl
e not eligible for premium tax credits
.  
Long
-Term 
State 
Stability and Innovation 
Program
. This legislation 
would 
provide a 
total of $62
 billion to fund grants to states
 for four purposes. The first, for which a 
minimum of $5 billion per year is allocated 
in 2019 through 2021, is to e
nter into 
 24 arrangements with health insurers to 
reduce
 premiums in the 
nongroup 
market
. CBO and 
JCT anticipate that about three
-quarters of the total funding would be used for that 
purpose
, which would in
crease health insurance 
coverage
Šprimarily for people not 
eligible for premium tax credits
. The other three purposes are the following: t
o help 
people
 purchase nongroup coverage 
if they
 have or are projected to have high 
health care
 cost
s and do not have access to health insurance
 offered through an employer
; t
o provide 
payments 
to 
health care providers
; and t
o provide assistance to reduce out
-of-pocket 
costs, such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles
, in the nongroup market.
  Conti
nuous Coverage
. This legislation would generally r
equire insurers, starting in 
calendar year 
2019, to impose a six
-month waiting period before coverage 
can 
start for 
people who enroll in insurance in the nongroup market if they have been uninsured for 
more
 than 63 days within the past year. 
Imposing th
at
 waiting period would
, CBO and 
JCT expect,
 slightly increase the number of people with insurance, on net, throughout the 
2018
-2026
 period
Šbut not in
 2019, when the incentives to obtain coverage 
would be 
weak
 because premium
s would be
 relatively high. 
  
Most insurance coverage
 in the nongroup market
, both under this legislation and under 
current law, would stem from decisions occurring during an open enrollment period at the 
end of the calendar year, and the f
ollowing discussion focuses on those decisions. 
(Enrollment outside those periods would be 
available
 only
 to people who experience 
qualifying events 
such as
 getting married
.) Several factors would tend to increase 
insurance coverage
 in the nongroup market
: 
   Some people, regardless of whether or not they had insurance coverage in a given 
year, would decide to purchase coverage at the beginning of the next year so that 
they would not be subject to a waiting period at the beginning of the year after 
that
Šwhe
reas 
without this provision, 
they would skip a year of coverage
, knowing that 
they
 could purchase coverage at the beginning of the 
upcoming 
year 
if they expected their 
use of 
health care to increase
.   Some people 
who were insured 
at the beginning of 
a give
n year 
would 
retain that
 cove
rage 
throughout the
 year if
, with an interruption in coverage, 
they had to wait 
until July of the following year to 
regain it
Šwhereas without the waiting period
, they
 would drop th
e coverage
 at some point during the year
.    Some people who were uninsured in 
a given 
year could concentrate their 
use of 
health care in the second half of the 
next 
year and pay premiums for 
6 months 
rather than 
12, increasing the value per month of the coverage
 and 
inducing
 them 
to be become insured
 during that period
Šwhereas without 
this provision,
 they 
would not be insured at all during that year. 
  Those factors, CBO and JCT estimate, would outweigh other factors that would tend to 
decrease coverage: 
  25   Some people who were 
uninsured 
for more than 
63 days 
and 
then 
decided to 
become insured 
at the end of a given 
year 
would have to wait six 
additional 
months 
to do so
, whereas without this provision
, they would become insured at the 
beginning of the next year
.   Some people who were uninsured 
for more than 63 days in a given year 
and 
expected to incur major health care costs during 
the 
first six months of the next 
year 
would
, with the waiting period,
 remain uninsured
 during that time
Šwhereas
 without 
th
e waiting period
, they would have purchased
 insurance 
at the beginning 
of the next year 
to help cover those costs
.   Age
-Rating
 Rules
. Beginning in 
calendar year 
2019, this legislation would expand the 
limits on how much insurers in the nongroup
 and small
-group markets can vary 
premiums on the basis of age. Under current law, a 64
-year
-old can generally be charged 
premiums that cost up to three times as much as those offered to a 21
-year
-old. Under 
this legislation, that allowable difference woul
d shift to five times as much unless a state 
chose otherwise. 
CBO and JCT anticipate that 
most 
states would 
accept 
that change.
  The 
change 
in age
-rating rules would tend to reduce premiums for younger people and 
increase premiums for older people, 
resulting in a slight increase in insurance coverage, 

on net
Šmainly among people not eligible for subsidies. T
he structure of the premium tax 
credits would limit 
the effect of such a change.
 People eligible for subsidies in the 
nongroup market 
would be
 lar
gely insulated from changes in premiums: A person 
receiving a premium tax credit 
would 
pay a certain 
maximum 
percentage of his or her 
income toward the reference premium, and the tax credit 
would 
cover the difference 
between the premium and that percentage
 of income. Consequently, despite the changes 
in premiums for younger and older people, the 
net premiums (after tax credits)
 for
 most 
people receiving subsidies
 would not be affected much
 by this provision
. The 
net 
premiums 
for older people ineligible for 
subsidies, however, would be much hi
gher under 
this legislation than otherwise.
  Minimum Medical 
Loss Ratio
. This legislation would
, starting in 
calendar year 
2019,
 repeal the federal requirement that health insurers maintain 
a minimum medical loss 

ratio, 
which is 
equivalent to capping the 
share of premiums that may go toward insurers™ 
administrative costs and profits.
 CBO and JCT anticipate that 
about 
half the population 
reside
s in states that would choose to maintain the current requirement. Other states 
would allow a greater share of 
premiums to go toward 
administrative costs and profits
. In 
those states, in 
areas with 
little competition 
among
 insurers, th
e provision would caus
e 
insurers to raise premiums
 and 
would 
increase federal costs
 for subsidies through the 
marketplaces
, CBO and JCT expect
. States would have little incentive to constrain 
premium increases for policies sold through the marketplaces if unsubsidized enrollees
 were able to buy a 
different and 
cheaper plan in the nongroup market sold outside the 
marketplaces. That is because premiums paid by subsidized
 enrollees 
in the marketplaces 
 26 would largely be determined by their income, and the increases would primarily be
 borne 
by the federal government
 in the form of larger premium tax credits
. The agencies expect
 that
 this provision would have little effect on the number of people covered by health 
insurance.
  Premium Tax Credits and Cost
-Sharing Reductions
. According to
 CBO and JCT™s 
estimates, the average subsidy per subsidized enrollee under this legislation would be 
significantly lower than the average subsidy under current law, starting in calendar year 
2020.
 Nevertheless, some people would be eligible for larger sub
sidies than those under 
current law, whereas others would be eligible for smaller ones. 
  Subsidies for people who enroll in an eligible plan under current law fall into two 
categories: subsidies to cover a portion of participants™ health insurance premium
s (which 
take the form of premium tax credits) and subsidies to reduce their cost
-sharing amounts 
(out
-of-pocket payments required under insurance policies). The first category of 
subsidies is generally available to people with income between 100 percent a
nd 400
 percent of the FPL, with certain exceptions. The second category is available to those 
who are also eligible for premium tax credits and who generally have a household income 
between 100 percent and 250 percent of the FPL.
  Under current law, the si
ze of the premium tax credits depends on household income and 
a reference premium in an enrollee™s rating area. The
 enrollee pays a certain 
maximum 
percentage of 
his or her
 income toward the reference premium
, and the size of the 
subsidy varies by geograph
y and age for a given income level. T
he premium tax credits 
cover the amount by which the reference premium
Šthat is, the premium for the second
-lowest
-cost silver plan that covers the eligible people in the household in the area in 
which they reside
Šexceed
s that percentage of income. 
The enrollee is insulated from 
variations in premiums in different geographic locations and is also largely insulated 
from increases in the reference premium. If a person chooses a plan with premiums 
higher than those for the r
eference plan, then he or she pays the difference as an 
additional amount toward the premium, providing some incentive to choose lower
-priced 
insurance. Similarly, if the person chooses a plan with premiums lower than the reference 

plan™s, then he or she p
ays a lower cost.
  
Under this legislation, starting in 2020, the reference premium would be changed to 
become the premium for the median plan with an actuarial value of 58 percent. Cost
-sharing subsidies would be eliminated. Eligibility for premium tax cre
dits would be 
extended to people with income below 100 percent of the FPL who were not eligible for 
Medicaid and eliminated for people with income above 350 percent of the FPL. For those 
with income exceeding 150 percent of the FPL, this legislation would 
generally reduce 
the percentage of income that younger people had to pay toward their premiums and 

increase that percentage for older people. (
For families, the age of the oldest taxpayer 
would be used to determine the age
-adjusted percentage of income tha
t must be paid 
toward the premiums.
)   27  Effects by Income. 
For many lower
-income people, t
he 
net premiums paid under this 
legislation would be similar to those under current law, but the plans they would purchase 

would have higher deductibles and other cost
-sharing requirements. In a set of illustrative 
examples, CBO and JCT estimate that a 40
-year
-old with income at 175
 percent of the 
FPL in 2026 could pay a net premium of $1
,700 for a silver plan under current law and 
$1,600 for a plan with actuarial value
 of 58 percent under this legislation (see Table
 5). 
However, because the reference premium would be changed and cost
-sharing subsidies 
would be eliminated under this legislation, the average share of the cost of medical 

services paid by the insurance purc
hased by that person would fall
Šfrom 87 percent to 
58 percent
Šand his or her payments in the form of deductibles and other cost sharing 
would rise.
3 Those changes, CBO and JCT estimate, would contribute significantly to a 
reduction in the number of lower
-income people who would obtain coverage through the 
nongroup market under this legislation, compared with 
the number under 
current law.
  
People with income
 below
 100 percent of the FPL who were not eligible for Medicaid 
could generally receive premium tax c
redits under this legislation and not under current 
law. However, even with the net premium of $300 shown in the illustrative examples for 
a person with income at 75 percent of the FPL ($11,400 in 2026), the deductible would 
be more than half their annual 
income. The net premium of a silver plan for a 40
-year
-old 
would be about 15 percent of their annual income, and the deductible would be more than 
one-third of their annual income. Many people in that situation would not purchase any 
plan, CBO and JCT esti
mate, although some people with assets to protect or who expect 
to have high use of health care would. 
  Many of the people who are projected be 
eligible
 for
 Medicaid under current law but not 
eligible
 under this bill
 would face a similar choice
. Those people would instead be 
eligible for a premium tax credit under this legislation. 
But b
ecause of
 the expense for 
premiums
 and the high deductible
s, most of them would not purchase insurance, CBO 
and JCT estimate. (
The vast majority of people enroll
ed in Medicaid pay no premium
s and have 
either 
no out
-of-pocket costs or nominal amounts of such costs
.)  Although offering a different benefit package would make plans more attractive to people 
with low income, it is difficult for insurers to design plans that have an actuarial value of 

58 percent and that pay for much care before the deductible is met
Šsuch a
s providing 
prescription drugs with low copayments. Those designs are constrained by the 
                                              3. In 2017, the average deductible for a single policyholder
 (for medical
 and drug expenses combined)
 is about 
$6,000 for a bronze plan (with an actuarial value of 60 percent) and about $3,600 for a silver plan (with an 
actuarial value of 70 percent). People with income
 of less the 250 percent of the FPL are eligible for plans 
with 
lower deductibles: about $2,900 for people with income between 200 percent and 250 percent of the FPL and a 
plan having actuarial value of 73 percent, about $800 for people with income between 150 percent and 200 
percent of the FPL and a plan having a
ctuarial value of 87 percent, and about $300 for people with income 
between 100 percent and 150 percent of the FPL and a plan having actuarial value of 94 percent. 
  28 requirements for 
EHBs,
 limits on out
-of-pocket spending
, and 
prohibitions on 
annual 
or 
lifetime limits on payments
 for covered services. (Waivers affecting 
the 
EHBs co
uld 
change th
ose constraints at least somewhat.)
  People with income between 350 percent and 400 percent of the FPL would be eligible 
for premium tax credits under current law, but not under this bill. People with income 
above 400 percent of the FPL would 
not receive premium tax credits in either case. 
However, for a 40
-year
-old 
with income 
at either 375 percent of the FPL or 450 percent 
of the FPL, net premiums 
for a single policyholder 
would be fairly similar under current 
law and the legislation for a pl
an with similar actuarial value. (Many people purchasing a 
family policy, however, would receive several thousand dollars in premium tax credits 
under current law that they would not receive under this bill.)
  Effects by Age. 
Enacting this legislation woul
d also result in significant changes in net 
premiums paid in the nongroup market according to people™s age. In the illustrative 

examples, CBO and JCT estimate that, under current law, a 21
-year
-old, 40
-year
-old, and 
64-year
-old with income at 175 percent o
f the FPL in 2026 would all pay the same net 
premium of $1
,700 for a plan with 
an 
actuarial value of 87 percent. Under this legislation, 
th
e 
net premium for a plan with a
n actuarial value of 58 percent would be smaller for 
younger people and larger for old
er people, but 
the net premium for a plan 
with 
an 
actuarial value of 70 percent
 would be larger for people of any age
.   For people not eligible for premium tax credits, premiums for older people could be five 
times larger than those for younger people in 
many states, rather than only three times 
larger under current law. Because of such differences, CBO and JCT estimate that, under 
this legislation, a larger share of enrollees in the nongroup market would be younger 
people and a smaller share would be olde
r people than would be the case 
under current 
law
.  Caps on Federal Medicaid Spending
. Under current law, the federal 
government 
and 
state governments share in the financing a
nd administration of Medicaid. 
In general, 
states pay health care providers for s
ervices to enrollees
, and the federal governmen
t 
reimburses states for a
 percent
age
 of their expenditur
es
. All federal reimbursement for 
medical services is open
-ended, meaning that if a state spends more because enrollment 
increases or costs per enrollee 
rise, additional federal paymen
ts are automatically 
generated. This bill would establish a per capita cap on 
most 
Medicaid spending 
for 
medical services 
and offer states an option for a block grant
 to provide medical services 
for
 certain adults
. In additio
n to affecting total spending, the caps would have a variety of 
other effects on states and enrollees, including an interaction with the effects of work 
requirements
, in the near term and the longer term
.  Per Capita Cap for Medicaid. 
Under this legislatio
n, b
eginning in 
fiscal year 
2020, the 
federal government would limit the amount of reimbursement it provides to states. 
That
 limit would be 
set for a state 
by calculat
ing
 the average 
per-enrollee 
cost of medical 
 29 services for most enrollees who received ful
l Medicaid benefits 
over eight consecutive 
quarters of the state™s choosing between the first quarter of federal fiscal year 2014 and 
the third quarter of 2017
. Those enrollees would be in five specified categories: 
the 
elderly, disabled
 adults
, nondisable
d children, 
adults made eligible for Medicaid by the 
ACA
, and all other adults
. The Secretary
 of HHS
 wou
ld then inflate the average per
-enrollee costs for each state 
for most 
nondisabled 
children and nondisabled adults 
enrolled in Medicaid 
using 
the CPI
-M and for most enrollees who are disabled 
adults 
or 
age 65 or older 
using the
 CPI
-M plus 1 percentage point
. Disabled children would be 
excluded from the per capita caps and covered as under current law.
 Beginning in 2025, 
the inflation factor for all groups
 wou
ld be the consumer price index for all urban 
consumers (CPI
-U). The final limit on federal 
reimbursement for each state starting in
 2020 would be the average cost per enrollee for 
the 
five specified groups of enrollees
, reflecting growth from the base 
period in the relevant inflation factors 
multiplied by the 
number of enrollees in each category. 
  
If a state spen
t more than the 
amount eligible for
 federal reimbursement, the federal 
government would provide 
no 
reimbursement for spending over the limit
. By CBO™s 
projections for the 2017
-2024 period, t
he limit on federal reimbursement would reduce 
outlays because
 Medicaid spending
, on a per
-enrollee basis, for nondisabled children and 
nondisabled adults under current law (
after the changes to the Medicai
d expansion 
population 
have been
 accounted for
) would 
grow 
faster
, at 4.9 percent, tha
n the CPI
-M, at 
3.7 percent. However, for 
most enrollees who 
are disabled adults or age 65 or older, that 
rate is 3.3 
percent
, lower than the CPI
-M plus 1 percentage poin
t. The per capita cap 
would have a small effect on spending 
for those groups
, even though the cap would not 
generally be binding for them, because
 some shifting of costs 
among 
groups would 
probably occur, and spending for a particular group in a particular
 year could be affected. 
In 2025
 and beyond
, the differences between spending growth for Medicaid under current 
law and the growth rate of the per capita caps for all groups would be substantial, as CBO 

projects the growth rate of the CPI
-U in 
those 
year
s to be 2.4 percent. 
  
Block Grant Option for States.
 Starting in 2020, under this legislation, states would have 
the option to receive federal aid for providing medical assistance to nondisabled adults 

(excluding 
adults made eligible for Medicaid by the ACA
) in the form of a block grant 
rather than 
under 
a per
-enrollee cap. A state™s initial block grant would be determined by 
multiplying the 
amount of the 
per capita cap, as estimated by the Secretary
 of HHS
, for 
the state™s nondisabled adult population by the state™s total number of nondisabled adult 

enrollees 
in
 the 
year before the
 preceding fiscal year, adjusted for population growth plus 
3 percentage points. In subsequent years
, the block grant amount wou
ld 
grow at the rate 
of the
 CPI
-U. 
  A state would be required to contribute, at a minimum, 
an amount calculated using its
 matching rate for enrollees under the Children™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
, not 
including the 23 percentage
-point decrease for s
uch rates established under the ACA
. (The state match
ing
 rate for CHIP ranges from 
18 percent to 
35 percent, depending on the 
 30 state, 
and
 average
s 30 percent.)
 Because this option would be attractive mainly to 
a few 
states that expect to decline in populati
on (and not in most states experiencing population 
growth, 
as it would further constrain federal reimbursement
), CBO expects this option 
would have little ef
fect on enrollment in Medicaid.
  Effects on States
 and Enrollees
. With less
 federal reimbursement for Medicaid, 
states
 would need to decide whether to commit more of their own 
resources
 to finance the 
program 
at current
-law levels 
or to reduce spending by cutting payments to health care 
providers and health plans, eliminating opt
ional services, restricting eligibility for 
enrollment
 through work requirements and other changes
, or (to the extent feasible) 
arriving at more efficient methods for delivering services. CBO anticipates that states 
would adopt a mix of th
ose approaches
, which would result in additional savings to the 
federal government.
  States would not have substantial additional flexibility under the per capita caps. Under 
the block grant option, states would have additional flexibility to make changes to their 
Medicaid
 program
Šsuch as altering cost sharing and, to a limited degree, benefits. 
  Other 
ways in which Medicaid spending caps affected enrollees would depend greatly on 
how states responded to the caps, which would be affected by the particular structure of 
their program. If state
s chose to leave 
their
 Medicaid program unchanged and instead 
found other ways to offset the loss of federal funds, enrollees would notice little or no 

change in their Medicaid coverage. 
To the extent that states delivered services m
ore 
efficiently, the health of enrollees would not be affected.
 
 If states reduced payment rates, fewer providers might be willing to accept Medicaid 
patients, especially given that, in many cases, Medicaid™s rates are already significantly 

below those of 
Medicare or private insurance for some of the same services. If states 
reduced payments to Medicaid
™s managed care plans, some plans might shrink their 
provider networks, curtail quality assurance, or drop out of the 
managed care 
program 

altogether. If sta
tes reduced covered services, some enrollees might decide either to pay 
out of pocket or to forgo those services entirely. And if states narrowed their categories of 

eligibility
 or used administrative procedures that made it more difficult to enroll
, some 
enrollees would lose access to Medicaid coverage, although some would become eligible 

for subsidies for 
nongroup
 coverage through the marketplaces or could choose to enroll 
in employment
-based insurance
, if it was available
.  Interaction of Work Requiremen
ts With Caps on Federal Spending.
 Because caps on 
federal Medicaid spending would shift a greater share of the cost of Medicaid to states 
over time, some states would, CBO anticipates, use work requirements
Šallowed under a 
separate provision that would tak
e effect in 
fiscal year 
2018
Što reduce enrollment and 
the 
associated 
costs. (CBO also anticipates that some states would adopt work 
requirements before spending caps took effect in 2020.) 
Under current law, states may 
not condition the receipt of Medicaid 
on any criteria related to a
 person
™s employment 
 31 status. 
This legislation would permit states to 
impose 
a work requirement
 for an adult
 as long as the individual 
is not 
disabled, elderly, or pregnant
 (or 
exempted for another 
specified reason)
. The definiti
on of work would be 
the same as
 the Temporary Assistance 
for Needy Families program
™s, which 
includes 
activities such as unsubsidized 
employment, subsidized employment, vocational training, 
and
 educational activities. The 
legislati
on would provide states 
with broad
 discretion to define how many hours 
of work 
each week
 were required
; how long 
enrolled people would
 have before 
needing to 
meet
 the requirements
; and
, if they failed to meet the requirements, when benefits would cease.
  Long
er
-Term Effects.
 Over
 the next decade, CBO projects
, a large gap would grow 
between Medicaid spending under current law and under this bill 
(see Figure 2 on page 
13). In later years
, that gap would continue to widen because of the compounding effect 
of the differences in spend
ing
 growth rates: 
CBO projects that the growth rate
 of 
Medicaid
 under current law 
would exceed 
the growth rate of the per capita caps for all 
groups
 covered by the caps
 starting in 2025
.   Under this legislation, after the next decade, s
tates would 
continu
e to 
need 
to 
arriv
e at 
more efficient methods for delivering services (to the extent feasible)
 and to 
decide 
whether to commit more of their own resources
, cut payments to health care providers 
and health plans, eliminat
e optional services, restrict eligibility for enrollment,
 or adopt 
some combination of those approaches
. Over the long term, there 
would
 be increasing 
pressure on more states to use all of those tools to a greater extent.
 CBO and JCT do not 
have an insuranc
e coverage baseline beyond the coming decade and therefore are not able 
to quantify the effect on
 insurance coverage in the long 
term. However, the agencies 
expect that after 2026, enrollment in Medicaid would continue to fall relative to what 
would happen
 under current law.
  Federal Matching Rate for Medicaid Costs
. Under current law, states are permitted
, but not required
, to expand eligibility for Medicaid to adults under 65 whose income is 
equal to or less than 138 percent of 
the FPL (who 
are 
referred t
o here as newly eligible). 
The federal government pays a larger share of the medical costs for those 
people
 than it 
pays for those who 
were previously eligible. Beginning in 
fiscal year 
2021, this
 legislation woul
d reduce the federal matching rate for all 
newly eligible
 adults from 
90 percent
 of the medical costs for them 
to 
85 percent in 2021, 80 percent in 2022, and 
75 percent 
in
 2023
. Thereafter, that rate would 
fall to the matching rate for other 
enrollees
. The federal match
ing
 rate for other enrollees ranges from 50 percent to 
75 percent, depending on the state, 
and 
averag
es
 about 57
 percent.
  The 
31 states and the District of Columbia
 that have already expanded Medicaid to the 
newly eligible cover roughly half of that populati
on nationwide. In its March 2016 
baseline, CBO projected that under current law, additional states will expand their 
Medicaid programs and that, by 2026, roughly 80
 percent of newly eligible people will 
reside in states that have done so. Under this legisl
ation, largely b
ecause 
states 
would pay 
for a 
great
er share of 
costs for enrollees
, CBO expects
 that
 no additional
 states would 
 32 expand eligibility, thereby reducing both enrollment in and spending for Medicaid, 
compared with the amounts anticipated under c
urrent law. 
  
CBO
 also 
anticipate
s that
 some
 states that have already 
expand
ed their Medicaid 
programs 
would no longer offer that coverage, 
gradually 
reducing the share of the newly 
eligible population residing in a state with expanded eligibility 
as the m
atching rate for 
that population decline
dŠwith that share reaching 
about 30 percent in 2026. That 
estimate reflects different possible outcomes without any explicit prediction about which 
states would make which choices. In considering the possible outcome
s, CBO took into 
account several factors: the extent of optional coverage provided to the newly eligible 

population and other groups before the ACA™s enactment (as a measure of a state™s 
willingness to provide coverage above statutory minimums), states™ ab
ility to bear costs 
under this legislation, and potential methods to mitigate those costs (such as changes to 
benefit packages and payment rates). Another factor is the possibility that some states, to 
avoid abrupt changes to eligibility and other aspects 
of the program, might begin to act 
before 2021 in anticipation of future changes that would result from this legislation. How 
individual states would ultimately respond is highly uncertain.
 
 Noncoverage Spending Provisions
  This legis
lation would also make changes to spending for other federal health care 
programs. CBO and JCT estimate that those provisions would 
decrease
 direct spending 
by about 
$22 billion over the 2017
-2026 period.
 This section provides additional details 
about the changes in direct spending 
resulting from provisions other than
 the coverage 
provisions
 (except for 
a provision 
eliminati
ng a limitation o
n recaptur
ing excess advance 
payments of premium tax credits, whic
h is discussed in JCT™s publications mentioned 
earlier
). (To most clearly link the analysis to the corresponding sections of the legislation, 
the headings in this section
, as well as 
in Table 2
, adopt its phrasing.)
  Better Care Reconciliation Implementati
on Fund
. Th
is bill 
would appropriate 
$500
 million for administrative expenses related t
o the cost of implementing the a
ct. 
CBO estimates that this provision would increase direct spending by $500 million over 
the 2017
-2026 period.
  
Federal Payments to Stat
es
. For a one
-year period following enactment, 
this legis
lation 
would prevent federal funds from being made available to an entity (including its 

affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, and clinics) if it 
is:   A nonprofit organization described in section 
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue 

Code and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the code;
   An essential community provider that is primarily engaged in providing family 

planning and reproductive health services and related medical care;
   33  An entity that 
provides abortions
Šexcept in instances in which the pregnancy is 
the result of an act of rape or incest or the woman™s life is in danger; and
   An entity that had expenditures under the Me
dicaid program that 
(when combined 
with the expenditures of
 its affil
iates, subsidiaries, successors, and clinics)
 exceeded $
350 
million in fiscal year 2014.
  CBO expects that the prohibition
, as phrased,
 would apply only if at least one entity, 
affiliate, subsidiary, successor, or clinic satisfied the first three criteria
. CBO identified 
only one organization that would be affected
: 
Planned Parenthood Federation of America 
and its affiliates and clinics.
4  Most federal funds received by such entities come from payments for services provided 
to enrollees in states™ Medicaid 
programs.
 CBO estimates that the prohibition would 
reduce direct spending by 
$225
 million over the 2017
-2026 period. Those savings would 
be partially offset by increased spending for other Medicaid services, as discussed below.
  To the extent that access t
o care
 would be reduced
 under 
this legis
lation, services that 
help women av
oid becoming
 pregnan
t would be affected
. The people most likely to 
experience reduced access to care would probably reside in areas without other health 
care clinics or medical prac
titioners who serve low
-income populations. CBO projects 
that about 15 percent of those people would lose access to care.
  Because the Medicaid program pays the costs of about 45 percent of all births,
 CBO 
estimates that the additional births stemming from the reduced access under 
this 

legis
lation would add to federal spending for
 the 
program.
 In addition, some of those 
children would themselves qualify for Medicaid and possibly for other federal progra
ms. 
By CBO™s estimates, 
during
 the one
-year period in which 
the funding prohibition would 
apply
, the number of births in the Medicaid program would increase by several thousand, 

increasing direct spending for 
the 
program
 by $79 million over the 2017
-2026 p
eriod. 
Overall, with those costs netted against the savings estimated above, implementing the 
provision woul
d reduce direct spending by $146
 million over the 2017
-2026 period, CBO 
estimates.
  Medicaid Provisions
. Under current law, states can elect the Com
munity First Choice 
option, allowing them to receive a 6 percentage
-point increase in their federal matching 
rate for some services provided by home and community
-based attendants to certain 
Medicaid recipients. The legislation would terminate the increase
 in the federal matching 
funds beginning in calendar year 2020
. That change
 would decrease direct spending by 
about $
19 billion over the next 10 years
, CBO estimates
.                                               4. If the provision w
as implemented in a way that affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, and cl
inics could 
satisfy the 
criteria
 separately
, then the provision could apply to more 
entities
, perhaps many more.
   34  Restoring Fairness
 in 
DSH 
Allotments
. Under current law, Medicaid allotments to 
states 
for payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of uninsured and 
Medicaid patients
Šknown as 
allotments for ﬁd
isproportionate 
share h
ospitals
,ﬂ or DSH 
allotments
Šare to be cut significantly in each year from 2018 to 2025. The cuts are 
currentl
y scheduled to be $2 billion in 2018 and to increase each year until they reach 
$8 billion in 2024 and 2025. 
  This legis
lation would eliminate those cuts
, starting in 2018,
 for states that 
did
 not expand 
Medicaid under the ACA.
 In addition, the Secretary 
of HHS would 
calculate each state™s 
ratio of its allotments for disproportionate share payments per Medicaid enrollee and 
incre
ase the allotments for 
state
s that 
did
 not expand
 Medicaid
 by an amount sufficient to 
bring their allotments for 2020 to 2023 up 
to the national average per enrollee. Th
ose changes would increase outlays by $
19 billion over the next 10 years
, CBO estimates
.  Reducin
g State Medicaid Costs
. This 
bill
 would decrease the period 
for which
 Medicaid benefits may be covered retroactively from up to 
three months before a 
recipient
™s application to the first of the month in which a recipient makes an application. 
By 
CBO™s estimates
, that change would decrease direct spending by about $5 billion
 over 
the 2017
-2026 period.
  Providing Safety Net Funding for Nonexpansion States
. This legis
lation would 
provide $2 billion in funding in each year from 2018 to 
202
2 to states that did not expand 
Medicaid eligibility under the ACA. Those states could use 
the funding, within limits, to 
supplement payments to providers that treat Medicaid enrollees. Such payments to 
providers would not be subject to the per capita caps. Any states that chose to expand 
Medicaid coverage as of July 1 of each year from 2017 thr
ough 2020 would lose access 

to the funding available under this provision in the following year and thereafter. CBO 
estimates that this provision would increase direct spending by $
10 billion over the 
2017
-2026 period.
  Provider Taxes
. Under current law, s
tates that tax health care providers are required to 
collect those taxes at uniform rates from all providers of the same type. The federal 
government limits the amount of such taxes that states can collect without incurring 
reductions in federal Medicaid p
ayments. Currently, that limit is set at 6 percent of a 
provider™s net revenues
 from services for patients
. The legislation would lower that limit 
to 5.8 percent in 2021 and further lower it by 0.2 percent
age points
 annually until the 
threshold reache
d 5.0
 percent. With those lower limits, states would collect less in 
provider taxes, and some states would probably reduce their Medicaid spending to 

compensate for at least part of the lost revenues. CBO estimates that such reductions 
would amount to about hal
f of the lost revenues, reducing direct spending by $
5 billion 
over the 2017
-2026 period.
   35 Medicaid and CHIP Quality Performance Bonus Payments
. This 
bill
 would provide 
$8 billion in funding 
from
 2023 through 2026 to states that spend 
some amount 
less 
(specified by the Secretary of HHS) 
than
 the 
cap on their 
per capita payment
s and that
 meet peer
-reviewed performance standards 
for
 health care quality 
in 
Medicaid and CHIP. 
Because CBO anticipates that only some states would meet the two criteria, and bec
ause 
some of the funds provided under the legislation would be spent after 2026, this provision 
is estimated to
 increase direct spending by $
3 billion over the 2017
-2026 period.
   
Prevention and Public Health Fund
. This legis
lation woul
d, beginning in fisc
al year 
2018
, repeal the provision that established the Prevention and Public Health Fund. 
The 
federal government
 awards grants through the fund to public and private entities to carry 
out prevention, wellness, and public health activities. Funding under c
urrent law is 
projected to be $900 million in 2018
 and to rise to $2 billion in 2025 and each year 
thereafter. CBO estimates that eliminating that funding would reduce direct spending by 

$9 billion over the 2017
-2026 period.
  
Support for State Response to 
Opioid
 Crisis
. This 
bill
 would provide $2 billion in 
2018
 for 
grants to 
states 
to 
support treatment and recovery services for 
people
 with 
substance use disorders
 or mental health problems
. CBO estimates that this provision 
would increase direct spending by $2 billion over the 2017
-2026 period.
  Community Health Center Program
. This legis
lation would increase the funds 
available to the Community Health Center Program, which provides grant
s to health 
centers that offer primary and preventive care to patients regardless of their ability to pay. 
Under current law, the program will receive about $4 billion in fiscal year 2017
, the last 
year funds are appropriated for the program
. The legis
latio
n would increase funding for 
the program by $422 million in fiscal year 2017. CBO estimates that implementing the 

provision would increase direct spending by $422
 million over the 2017
-2026 period.
  Changes in Spending Subject to Appropriation 
  CBO has no
t completed an estimate of the potential impact of 
this legis
lation on 
discretionary spending, which would be subject to future appropriation action.
   INCREASE IN LONG
-TERM DIRECT SPENDING AND DEFICITS
  CBO estimates that enacting this
 legislation would not increase net direct spending or on
-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10
-year periods beginning in 2027.
 The 
agencies expect that gross savings, particularly 
from
 Medicaid, would continue to grow
, while the gross costs wo
uld be smaller because the tax on employee
s™ health insurance 
premiums and health plan benefits would be reinstated in 2026.
    36 MANDATES ON STATE, LOCAL, AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS
  CBO has reviewed the nontax provisions of the legislation and determined that t
hey 
would impose intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA. If a nondomicile insurer 
applie
d for a license in a state to cover a small business health plan, and the state d
id
 not 
approve or deny the application within 90 days, the legislation would tem
porarily 
preempt the state™s laws and allow the insurer to operate in the state until action 
was taken on the application. In addition, the legislation would preempt state laws preclud
ing health insurance issuers from offering coverage for small business h
ealth plans. Although 
the preemptions would limit the application of state laws, they would impose no duty on 
states result
ing
 in additional spending or a loss of revenue
s.   
JCT has determined that the tax provisions of the legislation contain no 
intergov
ernmental mandates.
   
MANDATES ON T
HE PRIVATE SECTOR
  JCT and CBO have determined that the legislation would impose private
-sector mandates 
as defined in UMRA. On the basis of information from JCT, CBO estimates that the 
aggregate cost of the mandates 
imposed by the legislation would exceed the annual 
threshold established in UMRA for private
-sector mandates ($156 million in 2017, 
adjusted annually for inflation).
  Specifically, the tax provisions of the legislation contain two mandates. The legislation
 would recapture excess advance payments of premium tax credits (so that the full amount 

of excess payments 
would be
 treated as an additional tax liability for the individual) and 
would repeal the small business (health insurance) tax credit.
  In addition,
 the nontax provisions of the legislation would impose a private
-sector 
mandate on insurers that offer health insurance coverage in the nongroup market. The 
legislation would require those insurers to withhold coverage for six months from 
individuals who h
ave not maintained continuous coverage. The cost of the mandate 
would include the administrative costs of verifying continuous coverage for individuals 
who apply for insurance and enforcing waiting periods. Additionally, the cost to insurers 
would include 
any net loss of income resulting from the delay in the collection of 
premiums from policyholders during the mandatory waiting period or from people™s 
decisions not to purchase insurance because of the waiting period. 
But insurers also 
would 
gain premium co
llections beginning in 2018 from people induced to enroll by the 
continuous coverage 
provision
. In 2019
, the first year that th
e mandate would be in 
effect
, relatively few people would be induced to enroll by the continuous coverage 
provision
, because prem
iums would be relatively high and the net cost of the mandate 
would total about $100 million
, CBO estimates
. In subsequent years, more people would 
be induced to enroll by the continuous coverage provision in response to lower 
 37 premiums. In those years, pre
mium collections from people induced to enroll by th
at
 provision would more than offset the loss of premium collections
 from individuals who 
had not maintained continuous coverage.
   PREVIOUS CBO ESTIMATES
  This legislation would reduce federal deficits ov
er the 2017
-2026 period by $
202 
billion 
more than 
the 
House
-passed version of H.R. 1628
 (see Figure 
5).5 Direct spending would 
be $
89 billion greater, mainly because of higher Medicaid spending
 through 2024
. Revenues would be 
$291
 billion 
greater,
 primarily 
because 
a 
smaller
 share of the 
premium 
tax credits
, which are refundable,
 would 
take the form of a reduction in tax 
liability
 and because
 the 
income threshold for determining the medical care deduction
 would be
 higher
.6  The number of people wit
h health insurance coverage would be slightly lower under this 
legislation during the next two years and slightly higher in later years
Šbut the 
differences relative to the estimates for the House
-passed legislation would be no more 
than 1 million in any ye
ar. 
The structure of subsidies for coverage in the nongroup market 
differs in the two versions of the legislation and would have substantially different effects 
by income and by age. The overall spending on such subsidies under this legislation 
would be $1
34 billion lower than under the House
-passed legislation.
  Under both versions of the legislation, about half the population would be in states 
substantially affected by waivers to provisions of the ACA. 
Under this legislation, 
because many people in the n
ongroup market would be paying premiums based on their 
income, CBO and JCT expect that there would be less pressure to try to lower premiums 
by using waivers to narrow the scope of the EHBs than under the House
-passed 
legislation. 
However, there would be o
ffsetting pressure under this bill for states to obtain 
federal funding to pursue their policy goals. 
Waivers to requirements that people 
maintain continuous insurance coverage would not be allowed under this legislation, 
although they would be under the H
ouse
-passed version. However, waivers related to a 
broad array of other provisions, such as the structure of subsidies, would be allowed 
under this legislation.
                                                5. See Congressional Budget Office, cost estimate for H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017, as 
passed by the House of Representatives 
(May 24, 2017), 
www.cbo.gov/publication/52752
. For discussion of 
previous versions of the legislation, see Congressional Budget Office, cost estimate for H.R. 1628, the 

American Health Care Act, incorpor
ating manager™s amendments 4, 5, 24, and 25 (March 23, 2017), 
www.cbo.gov/publication/52516
, and cost estimate
 for the American Health Care Act (March 13, 2017), 
www.cbo.gov/publication/52486
. 6. Refundable tax credits reduce a filer™s income tax liability overall; if the credit exceeds the rest of the filer™s 
income tax liability, the government pays all or some portion of that excess to the taxpayer. See Congressional 
Budget Office, 
Refundable Ta
x Credits 
(January 2013), 
www.cbo.gov/publication/43767
.  38    39 On average, premiums in 2018 under this legislation and the House
-passed version would 
be about the same. Average premiums in 2019 would be 
slightly 
higher under this 
legislation, 
mostly 
because, in that year, 
subsidies would be larger for older people, wh
o have higher average costs
. For later years, the comparisons are difficult to make, mainly 
because of the complex effects of waivers in 
both versions of 
the legislation. 
For 
example, 
for 
the House
-passed
 version of the legislation, CBO and JCT did
 not hav
e an 
estimate of the average effect 
on premiums for the one
-sixth of the population residing in 
states
 that would make substantial changes to market regulations
, because the agencies 
judged that such an estimate
 would be
 too imprecise

analysis. 
Among
 the one
-sixth of the 
popul
ation
 residing in states that would make substantial changes to 
market regulations
, many people would pay low premiums but some people would pay very high premiums. 
CBO and JCT were uncertain how high those premiums could go, because insurers there might d
ecide to not 
offer policies with high premiums and their decisions are hard to predict.
 That uncertainty 
about insurers™ 
behavior 
had little effect on the agencies™ estimates of the number of people with insurance coverage or on the 
number of people using 
tax credits, because the number of peop
le who would pay high premiums wa
s not large. 
However, the high premiums for those people would have 
had 
a substantial effect on 
the 
agencies™ estimate of 
average premiu
ms. Thus, that uncertainty made
 the estimate of 
the average 
too imprecise

The actuarial value of a plan is the percentage of costs for covered services that the plan pays. Cost-sharing subsidies are payments made by the federal government to insurers that reduce the cost-sharing amounts (out-of-pocket payments required under insurance policies) for covered people whose income is generally between 100 percent and 250 percent of the FPL. The cost-sharing subsidy amounts in this example would range from $1,100 for a 21-year-old with income at 175 percent of the FPL to $3,350 for a 64-year-old at the same income level. Under current law, cost-sharing subsidies have the effect of increasing the actuarial value of the plan from 70 percent for a typical silver plan to 94 percent for people whose income is at least 100 percent of the FPL and not more than 150 percent; to 87 percent for people with income greater than 150 percent of the FPL and not more than 200 percent; and to 73 percent for people with income greater than 200 percent of the FPL and not more than 250 percent. People whose income is greater than 250 percent of the FPL would receive a standard 70 percent actuarial value when purchasing a silver plan. Under the BCRA, cost-sharing subsidies would be eliminated starting in 2020. Under current law and under the BCRA, insurers are required to offer at least one silver plan and one gold plan in each marketplace in which they offer coverage. Under the BCRA, CBO projects that plans will be available with actuarial values of 58 percent, 70 percent, and 80 percent. The premiums for plans at 70 percent and 80 percent reflect not only the difference in the percentage of costs paid but also the effect of ﬁrisk selection,ﬂ as people with higher expected health care costs are more likely to buy plans with higher actuarial values, and such differences are not fully eliminated by risk adjustment payments.e. The single individuals in this illustration are assumed to be ineligible for Medicaid in each case. Under the ACA, most nondisabled adults who are not pregnant with income less than 138 percent of the FPL are eligible for Medicaid if their state has expanded Medicaid. In most states that have not expanded Medicaid, such people with income less than 100 percent of the FPL are not eligible for either Medicaid or marketplace subsidies. A small number of legal permanent residents who have lived in the United States for less than five years with income less than 100 percent of the FPL are eligible for marketplace subsidies under current law; such circumstances are not reflected in this illustrative example. In CBO™s projections, under current law, about 80 percent of the potential newly eligible population resides in a state that has expanded Medicaid eligibility by 2026; and under the BCRA, about 30 percent of the potential newly eligible population resides in a state that has expanded Medicaid eligibility by 2026.Sources: Congressional Budget Office; staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.a. For this illustration, CBO projected the average national premiums for a 21-year-old in the nongroup health insurance market in 2026 both under current law and under the BCRA. On the basis of those amounts, CBO calculated premiums for a 40-year-old and a 64-year-old, assuming that the person lives in a state that uses the federal default age-rating methodology, which limits variation of premiums to a ratio of 3 to 1 for adults under current law and 5 to 1 for adults under the BCRA. CBO projects that, under current law, most states will use the default 3-to-1 age-rating curve; under the BCRA, CBO projects, most would use an age-rating curve with a maximum ratio of 5 to 1.d. Income levels reflect modified adjusted gross income, which equals adjusted gross income plus untaxed Social Security benefits, foreign earned income that is excluded from adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest, and income of dependent filers. CBO projects that in 2026, a modified adjusted gross income of $11,400 will equal 75 percent of the FPL, an income of $26,500 will equal 175 percent of the FPL, an income of $56,800 will equal 375 percent of the FPL, and an income of $68,200 will equal 450 percent of the FPL.b. Under current law, premium tax credits are calculated as the difference between the reference premium and a specified percentage of income for a person with income at a given percentage of the FPL. The reference premium under current law is the premium for the second-lowest-cost silver plan available in the marketplace in the area in which the person resides. A silver plan covers about 70 percent of the costs of covered benefits. The reference premium under the BCRA in a state without a waiver is the premium for a benchmark plan that covers 58 percent of the cost of covered benefits. CBO™s projection of the maximum percentage of income for calculating premium tax credits in 2026 takes into account the probability, estimated in CBO™s March 2016 baseline and under the BCRA, that additional indexing may apply. Such additional indexing applies if total federal subsidies through the marketplaces (including subsidies for both premiums and cost sharing) exceed a specified percentage of gross domestic product in the preceding year.  Under current law, that percentage is 0.504; under the BCRA, that percentage is 0.4.
