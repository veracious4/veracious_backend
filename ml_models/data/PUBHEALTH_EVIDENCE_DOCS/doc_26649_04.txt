Can we create a pandemic-free world? There is no such 
thing as a guarantee, but with meticulous preparation 

and rapid response, we can prevent most outbreaks 

from getting out of control, and limit the impact of 

those that spread internationally.
First, we must build and sustain resilient capacities at 
national, regional and global levels to prevent, detect 

and respond to outbreaks, in accordance with the 

International Health Regulations. 
And second, we must ensure that populations affected 
by emergencies have rapid access to essential life-

saving health services, including medicines and 

vaccines.
strengthen health systems, built on the foundation 

of people-centred primary health care that focuses 

on health promotion and disease prevention, with a 

strong focus on surveillance systems.
Delivering on these priorities will cost money of course, 
but only a fraction of what remaining unprepared will 

cost. In the end, prevention is not only better than cure; 




more than the death toll from the First World War. 
Thankfully, we have not seen a public health emergency on that 
scale since then. But we may at any time. Outbreaks are a fact of life, 

and the world remains vulnerable. We do not know where or when 

the next global pandemic will occur, but we do know that it will take 

a terrible toll, both on human life, and on the global economy.

It taught us a valuable lesson: that global health security is only as 
strong as its weakest link. No-one is safe until everyone is safe.

A potentially fatal combination of newly-discovered diseases, and the re-emergence of many 
long-established ones, demands urgent responses in all countries. Planning and preparation for

Although this publication is open to a wide readership, it is primarily intended to help the World

On this and other threats, the manual focuses on practical and indispensable things to know about 
infectious diseases that are most important for national political and operational decision-makers; 

it also links readers to more exhaustive WHO guidance. It has been developed in parallel with the 

creation of the WHO MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) on openWHO (

But we can say, with a high degree of certainty, that when it comes, there will be (a) an initial delay in 
recognising it; (b) a serious impact on travel and trade; (c) a public reaction that includes anxiety, or even 

panic and confusion, and (d) this will be aided and abetted by media coverage.
The concept of global health security, a central issue in this handbook, represents a new determination 
by, or on behalf of, human society to protect itself from the health impact and social disruption caused 

by outbreaks. It encompasses a spectrum of ways and means that offer worldwide protection against the 

threats of infectious diseases, backed by revised and more powerful International Health Regulations

capital cities where the outbreaks grew into large epidemics. In such circumstances, it is essential to raise 




As we have signaled earlier, another indispensable element of increasing health security is 


primarily at known pathogens because some of them are likely to behave differently than previously. 

The recent plague outbreak in Madagascar, described earlier, is a good example of known diseases 

with new patterns.  
In addition, the fear generated by the emergence of a previously-unknown infection may be 
greatly out of proportion to its real public health impact. Fear often generates inadequate decisions 

or inappropriate behaviours, including stigma of certain at-risk populations. The impact on travel and 

trade and on economies can be disproportionate, as it has been seen in the Republic of Korea during

it harder to get access to health care services. Some may die as a result, if the disruption overwhelms the

Furthermore, health care settings, and especially emergency rooms, can become hubs of transmission. 
Many people get infected there, if prevention and control measures are not properly implemented. This

24 The face of epidemics and pandemics has changed in the recent past and continues to do so. Many new 
factors contribute to an increase in the transmissibility and severity of infectious diseases.
New lifestyles spread diseases further
New and more intense factors amplify the transmission of diseases, either because they increase contacts 

between people, or between animals and people. In an era of rapid global change, many of these factors 

are almost inevitable. Among them are the fast and intense mobility of people, with increased transport 

and international travel, and greater inter-connectivity between megacities which are major transport 

hubs for aircraft, trains, road vehicles and ships. 

people within and between them. For decades, more and more people have been migrating from the 

countryside into cities, in search of better jobs and improved living standards. The unprecedented levels 



disease transmission. 
These risks apply at least equally to densely populated areas on the periphery of cities, where rural areas 
overlap with them. Here, close and repeated contacts between people and livestock, domestic animals 

and wildlife raise the likelihood risk of new epidemics. To make matters worse, these peri-urban areas 
tend to be poorer, and local people have less access to health care 
facilities. The double jeopardy here is that their infections may 

go undetected and untreated, while the options for detection, 



have seen many humanitarian emergencies, the 


disasters. Millions of people have been uprooted from 
their homes and become either refugees, asylum-seekers or 

often overcrowded, that also increase infection risks.

Epidemics of rumours: a new risk to 
healthA new word has entered the public health 


as the rapid spread of information of all kinds, 

including rumours, gossip and unreliable 

information. They are spread instantly and 

internationally through the growing popular use 

of mobile phones, social media, the internet 

and other communication technologies. A 

proliferation of web-based ﬁexpertsﬂ with diverse 
and often contradictory views can generate 
confusion, anxiety and even panic in times of 

serious infectious outbreaks. False or misleading 

information is dangerous. It can cause widespread 

public reluctance to adopt well-founded infection 

control measures promoted by health authorities 


This is why risk communication, a set of 
sophisticated skills, is increasingly employed 
by health authorities, agencies, physicians 
and professional health personnel. It is more 

important now than ever to learn and apply them. 

The latest and most accurate information must 

be conveyed frequently, and uncertainties related 

to an epidemic must be acknowledged in order 

to maintain credibility and public trust.

techniques, but new skills and new attitudes 

all across the public health community. Risk 

communication is examined at greater length in

the diverse disease drivers are taken into 

consideration: genetics and biological factors, 

ecology and the physical environment; human 

behaviour and demographics; social, political, 

and economic factors, and so on. 
This increasing convergence of many factors 
that drive and amplify outbreaks requires multi-

disciplinary, multi-sectoral and multi-faceted 

approaches.
Moreover, because epidemics are social 
problems as much as medical ones, we need 

to move beyond the traditional biomedical 

approaches to them. Social sciences should

Key insights into infectious 
disease epidemics27 Because new infectious disease threats usually start locally, it is important to understand their dynamics in

dynamics of epidemic and pandemic diseases typically occur in four phases, although not all epidemic 

diseases necessarily go through each phase.

phase is reduced transmission when human-to-human transmission of the pathogen decreases, owing 

to acquired population immunity or effective interventions to control the disease. These four phases are

32 Health Information
In every event, information is necessary to monitor it, measure the impact of interventions and 
to guide decision-making throughout the crisis. There are two particular types of information: 

surveillance of the disease
, and information on the interventions
 (process and output indica
-
tors), which shows the coverage and impact of the interventions being performed. Surveillance 

provides information on the number of cases and deaths by period and place (people, time, and 

place). Information on the interventions enables knowing which ones are performed and what is 

their coverage and impact.

is the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within 



information of all kinds, including rumours, gossip and unreliable information. We describe this 

phenomenon as an ﬁinfodemicﬂ. 
Infodemics, like epidemics, can be managed. Field epidemiology is an important part of 
outbreak response. It encompasses three main areas: 
(1) monitoring and identifying health 

threats, 
(2) outbreaks investigation, and 
(3) actions for mitigation and control. Similarly, successful 
management of infodemics will be based on 
(1) monitoring and identifying them, 
(2) analysis of 
them, and 
(3) control and mitigation measures
1. Risk communication is an essential intervention in any response to disease outbreaks, and is 

equally necessary to manage infodemics. Communicating risk in epidemics involves two-way 

communication that is dynamic and evolving as the outbreak develops.
Outbreak risk communication involves three main strands that must work together.  

1.  Talk.
 Authorities, experts and response teams must quickly relay information on the nature of 
the event and the protective measures that people can take. We can use mass media including 

television, radio, newspapers and internet; social media and text-messaging; community radio; 

community engagement; as well as face-to-face communication via trusted interlocutors 

translational communication approaches to develop messages that are appropriate for the 
target populations in terms of language, educational level and cultural contexts. 
2.  Listen. Responders, experts and authorities must quickly assess and understand the fears, 

concerns, perceptions and views of those affected; and tailor their interventions and messages 

to address such concerns. This requires the use of social science and community engagement 

expertise and methods. 
3.  Manage rumours. 
Disease outbreaks are often accompanied by the presence of false rumours 
and misinformation. Responders need to have ways to listen to such misinformation and 

correct examples of it in appropriate ways without delay.  
1 This is called ﬁinfodemiologyﬂ. 
34 
First, early, transparent and understandable communication on the event establishes lines of 
dialogue with affected populations and stakeholders, and builds trust in the response. This type 

of communication must have facts and information (that cater to the head); and include messages 


Second, frequent but evolving communication will help create a trusted and dynamic relationship 
that can deliver advice on protective behaviors that populations and individuals can adopt. 
Third, communication must scope the risk in lay language, and also propose practical actions 



Fourth, communication must display accountability by keeping people updated on the situation, 
on what is being done, and the impact of those actions in bringing the outbreak under control.

38 Three elements of community 
engagementDisease outbreaks and epidemics are 
complex phenomena with three aspects that 

are intimately intertwined: medical, social 

and political. Community engagement is an 

approach to address the social (and to some 

degree the political) aspects of epidemics. 

Community engagement is essential for the 

effective control of infectious diseases, through 

acceptance of public health interventions. It is 

based on three elements:
1.  
responders and communities to understand 

the perceptions and beliefs on both sides, 



patterns of transmission that exist at 

community level. 
2.  Building trust through this mutual 



reduce transmission.
3.  

with necessary medical and other supplies 

to implement the measures required 
to stop the disease, and progressively 
transferring knowledge for sustained and 

safe interventions within the community.
A key community to empower 

during outbreaks are health 

care workers, and volunteers 

who are often the frontline 

responders. These frontline 

workers are ﬁthe faceﬂ 

or representatives of the 

whole outbreak response, 

to the community. 

Their attitude towards 
community members 
and their collaboration 

in implementing health 





is perceived and accepted, 

or rejected by community 

members. 
Key points of health action in epidemics that 
require intensive engagement of communities 

(affected populations as well as health care 

workers and frontline responders themselves) 

include:1.  Detecting an outbreak and detection of 
newly infected people (case detection, 

contact tracing); 
2.  

and community levels) that can increase 
susceptibility and exposure; and adopting 

protective practices (medical and non-

medical); 
3.  Seeking and providing health care as 

advised (in the household, community and 
health facility);
4.  Re-integrating of survivors back into the 

5.  Identifying and managing misinformation 

and rumours.39 Ten things to know
1.  Disease outbreaks affect the social 
fabric of communities. A community is a 

social network, and infectious diseases 

outbreaks are deeply linked to the social 



interactions. They spread through personal 

and social contacts and links at home 

or during professional and recreational 

activities. 
2.  Communities are the main actors in 

preventing, identifying, responding and 

recovering from the physical, psychological, 

social and economic impacts of epidemics. 

Communities are not passive subjects of 

interventions. 
3.  

The time pressure is particularly challenging 

for community engagement. The beginning 

of the outbreak is a crucial time to build the 

necessary trust with the population who can 

break the transmission cycle. Any outbreak 

response that builds on existing and trusted 
community engagement systems and work 
with trusted individuals and interlocutors 

are more likely to succeed.
4.  Community understanding of diseases and 

their spread is complex, context-dependent 





effective. 
5.  Communities are multi-layered, and power 

dynamics exist between individuals, groups 

and networks. Social scientists can help 

analyse these dynamics and work with 
specialists in health education, health 

promotion and local communities. There 

are simple tools that can assess relevant 

perceptions and beliefs for any outbreaks 

response. Together they can design the 

messages and interventions necessary 

to raise awareness, and adapt or change 
behaviours to meet the demands of a new 


response teams will also help to monitor 

how people adapt public health measures 

to different social contexts, and whether 

these are implemented in a way that 

respects social and cultural systems.
6.  Community engagement helps to 

strengthen and ensure resilience to future 

outbreaks: when people have already 

learned how to implement their own 

solutions, they will be better able to deal 

with the next outbreak. 
7.  The approach and messaging directed 

towards each community has to evolve 

with the epidemic and incorporate new 

messages and communication methods 

as it unfolds. These messages must 

also proactively detect misinformation 


engagement limits the opportunities for 
misunderstandings and the proliferation of 

rumours, and it mitigates the spread of fear 

and anxiety. 
  8.  Identify people that the community 

trusts and build relationships with them. 

Involve them in decision-making to 

ensure interventions are collaborative, 
contextually appropriate and that 

communication is community-owned.
  9.  Two-way communication should be 

achieved through the most socially-

acceptable and effective channels. 

Messages must be ﬁtranslatedﬂ into local 

language, local context and to match 

the education levels and preferences 

(e.g. visual, written or oral cultures) of the 

target population. All communication 

with communities should be transparent, 

timely, easy-to-understand, acknowledge 

uncertainty, address affected populations, 



using multiple platforms, methods and 

channels.10.  Disease creates fear which often leads 

to practices that further amplify the 

epidemic. These can be both individual 

and collective. They can relate to the 

transmission of the disease, or the stigma, 

and extreme stress on the ties that bind 

communities. 
40 Ensuring effective community 
engagementTo ensure effective community engagement: 
3 elements are needed for communities and 


For communities: Ł  Knowledge: communities must know what 
the disease is, how it is transmitted, and 
how to protect against it (social mobilisation 

messages);Ł  Trust:
 it is the most important determinant 

to ensuring communities heed public 

health advice. Communities must be 

consulted, engaged, and whenever possible 

participate in identifying and  implementing 

response measures that communities and 

responders want above all to treat patients 
and stop the epidemic; 
Ł  
 communities must be able to 
implement control measures (e.g. access 

to soap and water, to gloves, to waste 

management services, to transportation, to 

safe burial teams, etc.).
Ł  Field responders need to 
understand the local perceptions of the 

disease and of the response measures;
Ł  Listen: Field responders need to listen to 



their own behaviours accordingly;
Ł  Support: Field responders need to support

41 Risk communication Œ a life-saving 
action in public health emergencies
The essence of risk communicationRisk communication is one of the key pillars of 
response to outbreaks. It refers to the real-time 

exchange of information, advice and opinions

ultimate goal is that everyone at risk is able to

preventive action.

on how to protect their health), it also enables 

countries and communities to preserve their 

social, economic and political stability in the 

face of emergencies.
For these reasons, risk communication is one 
of the core capacities that all countries have 

agreed to develop in order to prevent the 

international spread of disease and other 

dangers as required under the International 


42 21st century aspects change and

1.  
2.  People now seek health advice mostly on

In disease outbreaks and epidemics, life-saving 

decisions need to be made rapidly and actions 

must follow promptly, with the support of an

and international levels).
Furthermore, emergency and outbreak 
communications now take place in a variety of 

contexts:  
Ł  In a shifting complex, crowded environment: 
information is incomplete and many 

different actors are exchanging public health 

information and competing for authority.
Ł  Where communications are diverse: these 
include public communication, supporting 

national governments in risk communication, 

strategic communication, communication 

with affected communities and response 

personnel, media relations, knowledge 

transfer, message development, partner 

communication, internal communication and 
health promotion functions, etc.
Ł  Where risk communication is an under-
resourced priority with a lack of investment 

in skills, resources and expertise at country 

level.  
Ł  Where there is an increased public demand 
for participation in policy-making and for 

self-determination.
43 Making it effective
Ł  
Risk communication only works when there 
is communication based on trust between 

those who know (experts), those in charge 

(authorities or response teams) and those 

affected (communities). Without trust, 

people are unlikely to follow the advice given.

expressions of caring and empathy; and their 

ability to identify with people at risk.

political viewpoints, social norms and prior

44 Ten things to know and do
1. Build trustŁ  People must trust those responsible for 
managing the outbreak and for issuing

containment.Ł  Accountability is key: communicators 
must demonstrate that they and outbreak 

managers are accountable for what they say,

communication interventions should link 

to functioning and accessible services, be 

transparent, timely, easy-to-understand, 

acknowledge uncertainty, address affected 



disseminated using multiple platforms, 

methods and channels.
Ł  The building blocks of trust include:
-  Being perceived as experts with credibility 
by providing expert advice that is correct 
and accurate and being consistent with other 

trusted agencies and entities;
-  Being perceived as having a good character 
by telling the truth and not omitting important 
information, and acting on promises;
-  Identifying with the affected population as 
sharing the same concerns and fate;


caring in messages and their delivery.  
2. Communicate uncertainty proactively 
Ł  Communication by authorities to the public 
should include explicit information about 

uncertainties associated with risks, events 

and interventions and indicate what is known 

and not known at a given time.
Ł  Announce the event as early as possible, even 
when the information is incomplete. This will 

establish you as the leader to communicate 

risk; it will build trust in you and the response; 

it will help enable changes in practice and 

behaviors to bring the outbreak under 



and rumours.Ł  A good template to communicate uncertainty 
is as follows:
-  State what is known, what is unknown, and 
what you/your institution is doing about the 

issue;

the event if possible, communicate often, 

communicate regularly;
-  Provide information on the risk/danger; but 
supplement it with some advice on how 

people can protect themselves;
-  Speak as a human being, using empathy 
appropriately;
-  Do not over-reassure.
3. Engage communities 
Ł  Identify people that the community trusts 
and build relationships with them and 

involve them in decision-making to ensure 

interventions are collaborative, contextually 

appropriate and that communication is 

community-owned.Ł  Community engagement is one important 
start for communicating risk and facilitating 

changes in behaviours and practices (
see 

Focus 1, page 38). 
4. Message wellŁ  According to the latest evidence, risk should 
not be explained in technical terms as this 

is not helpful for promoting risk mitigation 

behaviours. Consistent messages should 

come from different information sources 

and emerge early in the outbreak. Messages 



realistically take to protect their health.
5.  Establish and use listening and feedback 
systemsŁ  Use multiple means (surveys, focus group 
discussions, community walk-throughs, 

key informants, feedback from front-line 

45 feedback, social media, etc.) to listen to the 
public and affected communities.
Ł  Use these to understand what concerns 
people regarding the outbreak or the 

measures we are asking them to adopt.
Ł  Use these systems to test messaging 
and materials developed to support risk 
communication.
6. Use social media as appropriate
Ł  Social media should be used to 
engage the public, facilitate peer-to-
peer communication, create situational 
awareness, monitor and respond to rumours, 

public reactions and concerns during an 

emergency, and to facilitate local level 

responses. 
Ł  Social media and traditional media should be 
part of an integrated strategy with other forms 

of communication to achieve convergence 


7. Risk communication operations requires 

resources
Ł  Risk communication in epidemics is a massive 
operational undertaking and requires 

people, logistics, material and funds.
Ł  Different types of expertise in many areas 
are required: media communications, social 



health promotion, community engagement, 
behavioral change communication; 
stakeholder communication, communication

health complacency, and the emergence 
of antibiotic resistance - have completely 
changed the way infectious diseases are 

confronted today.

care 
But whether the focus is on antibiotics, 
antivirals, vaccines or the whole armoury of 

other treatments, the vital, universal fact is 





dedicated health personnel, all across the 

spectrum of care. When, for example, no

can still protect and save lives. This has 
been shown by a dramatic reduction in 





through the provision of better supportive 

care for patients.
Protecting frontline responders 
The role of the health workforce should never 

be underestimated nor taken for granted. 

In general, much of their day-to-day work is 

mundane and routine, providing tried-and-

tested care and treatment for familiar illnesses, 

disabilities and injuries. 
But when an epidemic strikes, they make 
a vital difference at all levels, whether as 

community health workers and volunteers, 
midwives, nurses, or doctors. With little or no 
warning, they are transformed into frontline 

responders, thrust into immediate contact with 

infected communities and individuals. Family 

members, too, take on the role of caring for 

their relatives at home, often linking up with 

health staff in clinics, hospitals and emergency 

centres.
This transformation is double-edged and 
dangerous for frontline responders. First, their 

immediate priorities are to prevent the spread 

of an epidemic, protect those people who 
are most at risk, and to care by all possible 

means for those who are already infected. The 

related dangers are obvious: health workers 



themselves in the most dangerous place at the 

most dangerous time.
Yet, because their job is to care for the sick 
and injured, health care workers are often 

viewed as ﬁimmuneﬂ to injury or illness. Their 



human transmission is a major factor in many 

infectious diseases that cause epidemics. 

Patients are highly contagious and can spread 

the disease at home, at work, in public spaces, 

but also in hospitals. 
Thus, it is essential to protect them from 


wider protection of the affected community. It 

is here that emergency planning, preparation, 

training and coordination are so essential, as 

is the urgent provision of practical safeguards, 

especially the necessary personal protective 
equipment and the knowledge of how to use 
it properly.
49 Confronting the human resources 
crisis 
These measures may seem obvious, but the 
role of frontline responders is frequently 

shackled by a major disadvantage: there are 

not nearly enough of them. This unpalatable 

truth applies to the health workforce in 

general. It is a global problem, but it is most 

acute in the poorest countries with weakest 

health systems, where epidemics are most 

likely to erupt.
Protecting the occupational health of health 
workers is critical to have an adequate 

workforce of trained and healthy health 
personnel. This is nowhere more true than at 
the heart of an infectious disease epidemic.
Around the world, health care facilities employ

despite numerous attempts to tackle it, but

These four factors are inter-related and inter-

dependent. The absence or inadequacy of any 

one of them undermines all the others. Without 



workers cannot be guaranteed. If they are 

available and accessible, without acceptability, 

the health services may not be used. When the 

quality of the health workforce is inadequate, 

improvements in health outcomes will not be 

satisfactory.

goes beyond the scope of this handbook. But 
it is important that they are taken into account 
in the context of infectious disease prevention, 
treatment and control. Indeed, they lead 

to recognition that protecting health care 



to quality patient care and health system 

strengthening. 
If it is accepted that health begins with health 

workers, their empowerment is necessary 

on a general basis. Their voice, rights and 

responsibilities must play a central role in 

developing and implementing solid policies 

and strategies towards universal health 

coverage. This applies to the context of 

epidemic disease control as much as it 

does to other health issues more widely. 
The engagement of communities during 
epidemics, including health workforce 

community, needs to be at the center of the 

epidemic response.

ticks and the disease is endemic 

where the tick vector is present 
Ł  Ticks of the genus 
Hyalomma are the 
principal vector of the disease, although 

a number of tick are capable of becoming 

infected with CCHF virus.
Ł  Animals become infected by the bite of 

infected ticks and the virus remains in 

their bloodstream for about one week 

after infection, allowing the tick-animal-

tick cycle to continue when another tick 

bites.Ł  The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide 

range of wild and domestic animals such 

as cattle, sheep and goats. Many birds 

are resistant to infection, but ostriches 

are susceptible and may show a high 

prevalence of infection in endemic areas.

informal urban settings.
Ł  There are three types of transmission 

cycles. However, with climate and 
demographic change in endemic settings, 


-  Sylvatic (or jungle) Yellow fever: 
In 
tropical rainforests, monkeys, which are 

the primary reservoir of yellow fever, are 

bitten by wild mosquitoes which pass the 
virus on to other monkeys. Occasionally, 
humans working or travelling in the forest 
are bitten by infected mosquitoes and 

develop yellow fever. This is the most 

common type of outbreak in the Americas;
-  Intermediate Yellow fever:
 In this type of 
transmission, semi-domestic mosquitoes 

(those that breed both in the wild and 

around households) infect both monkeys 

and people. Increased contact between 

people and infected mosquitoes leads to 

increased transmission and many separate 

villages in an area can develop outbreaks 

at the same time;
-  Urban Yellow fever:


occur when infected people introduce 

the virus into heavily populated areas with 

high mosquito density and where most 

people have little or no immunity, due to 

lack of vaccination. In these conditions, 

infected Aedes Aegypti 
mosquitoes 
transmit the virus from person to person. 

This is the most serious outbreak because

vector control are the two main 

pillars of YF outbreak response
Vector control:

Community engagement is essential for 

these interventions:


eggs/larvae/pupae in standing water 

(e.g. cleaning roof gutters, clean-up 

campaigns, etc.);-  Targeted residual spraying of adult 
mosquitoes (in areas known to be resting 

sites for Aedes mosquitoes) and space 

spraying when there is an outbreak;
-  Mosquito control programmes targeting 
wild mosquitoes in forested areas are 

not practical and not recommended 

for preventing jungle (or sylvatic) yellow 

fever transmission.3Ł  Additionally, personal preventive 


skin exposure, use of repellents, as well 

as windows screens and air conditioning 

are recommended to avoid mosquito 

bites. The use of insecticide-treated bed 

nets is limited by the fact that Aedes 

mosquitos bite during daytime.
Ł  Mosquito surveillance is part of vector 
control and helps improve timeliness 

of decisions to control mosquito 

populations and prevention disease. 

Both larval and adult vector populations

Emergency mass vaccination:

autochthonous transmission (human-

mosquito-human) of YF virus within a 

community and ensure that sporadic 

unvaccinated cases do not generate 

secondary cases.90 Vaccine production is limited

stockpileŁ
manufacturers and global supply 

production is limited. There is a global 

emergency stockpile of six million 

vaccine doses, which can be accessed 

by any country facing an outbreak,

immunity and stop human-to-human 

transmission.-  Children under two years of age should 
be offered a full dose, as they may have a 

weaker immune response to the vaccine

-  There is no evidence of increased serious 
adverse effects when using a fractional 

dose.5YF vaccine is safe and provides 
lifelong immunityŁ  There is a good vaccine against YF. It 
has been used for many decades and is 

safe and affordable, providing effective 

immunity against yellow fever within 





of people vaccinated. A single dose 

provides lifelong protection. A booster 

dose of yellow fever vaccine is not 
needed.Ł  Adverse effects of the Yellow fever 
vaccine are generally mild and may 

include headaches, muscle aches, 

and low-grade fevers. Serious adverse 

effects are rare.
Ł  In Yellow fever endemic countries, 
WHO strongly recommends routine 

vaccination for everyone older than 



age should be given the vaccine after 



Some people should not be routinely

162 12Cholera is transmitted by faecally-
contaminated water and foodŁ  A person can become infected by drinking 
water or eating food contaminated by the 

bacterium Vibrio Cholerae
.Ł  Bacteria present in the faeces of an 

infected person are the main source of 

contamination. 
Ł  Food may be contaminated by soiled 

hands during preparation, or while eating 

or by some irrigation practices.
Ł  During funeral ceremonies, transmission 

may occur through consumption of 

food and beverages contaminated by 

someone who touched the corpse of the 

deceased and also prepared the food 

without adequately washing their hands, 

or by funeral attendees touching the 

corpse.Ł  Beverages prepared with contaminated 

water and sold by street vendors are 

vehicles of Cholera transmission, as well 
as vegetables and fruits ﬁfreshenedﬂ 
with contaminated water and raw or 

undercooked seafood.
Ł  The bacterium can persist in water for 

long periods and multiply in moist left-

over food.Cholera is closely linked to 
inadequate access to clean water 

and sanitationŁ  The long-term solution for Cholera 
control lies in economic development 

and universal access to safe drinking 

water and adequate sanitation. These 

measures prevent both epidemic and 

endemic Cholera as well as other faeco-

orally transmitted and water-borne 

diseases. They may require substantial 

long-term investments. 
Ł  Cholera is closely linked to poor 

environmental conditions. The absence 

or shortage of safe water and of proper 

sanitation are the main contributors to the 

spread of the disease. Typical at-risk areas 

are peri-urban slums, with precarious 

basic infrastructure, as well as internally 

displaced or refugee camps.  
Ł  Actions to reduce the transmission of 

Cholera include: 
-  The implementation of adapted long-
term sustainable WASH (Water Sanitation 

and Hygiene) solutions to ensure use of 

safe water, basic sanitation 

and good hygiene practices

-  Awareness campaigns should be 

provided to the community about the 

potential risks and symptoms of Cholera, 

precautions to take to avoid Cholera, when

172 Secondary human-to-human 
transmission exists 
Ł  It can result from close contact with 
infected respiratory tract secretions, skin 

lesions of an infected person or objects 



or lesion materials. The virus does not 

transmit easily from human to human.
Ł  Persons become infectious to others once 

the rash appears.
Ł  As transmission occurs primarily via 

droplet respiratory particles and usually 

require prolonged face-to-face contact, 

household members of active cases and 

people caring for the sick are at greater 

risk of infection. 
Ł  Transmission can also occur by parenteral

appointed at headquarters to assist with the coordination of 
Organization-wide support.Grade 3A single country or multiple country emergency, requiring a major/maximal 
WHO response. Organizational and/or external support required by the WCO

Ł  The ICG brings partners together to improve cooperation and coordinating of epidemic 

preparedness and response. 
Ł  The ICG also works on forecasting vaccine stocks, negotiating vaccine prices through 

its networks or partners, evaluating interventions and standard protocols for managing 

diseases.
227 Why is such mechanism needed?

What is the ICG mandate? 
Ł  The core mandate of the ICG is to make available 
and ensure equitable access to vaccines for 

Cholera, Meningitis, and Yellow fever during 

outbreaks. 
Ł  The ICG mechanism seeks to ensure timely and 

targeted deployment so that vaccines can be used 

as effective outbreak responses where they are 

most needed. 
Ł  The ICG also manages the global emergency 
vaccine stockpiles and, working with manufacturers, 


the goal of ensuring that adequate stocks of 

emergency supplies are accessible for emergency 

response.
What are the guiding principles of 
the mechanism?  
Three principles guide the mechanism:  
Ł  Equity: distribution of vaccine based on public 
health priorities; 
Ł  Rapid and timely access:
 delivery of vaccine 

Ł  Independence: decisions made independent of 



goal of improving public health. 
TOOL BOX 2228 Who are the ICG™s partners? 
The ICG is made up of four member agencies:
Ł  International Federation of the Red Cross 
and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)

goods. 
Shippers of infectious substances shall ensure 
that packages are prepared in such a manner 

that they arrive at their destination in good 


animals during transport. Basic triple packaging system This system of packaging shall be used for 

all infectious substances. It consists of three 

layers as follows:

epidemics as they have adapted to urban settings and can lay eggs in any kind of recipient 

containing water in and around houses and other human dwellings in urban and scattered 

rural areas. 
Ł  The development of the larvae can be very short, less than a week, and thus the increase of 

the mosquito population can be exponential if the conditions are favorable (temperatures and 

water) in the absence of any vector or larvae control. 
Ł  It is thus strongly recommended to maintain regular control of these mosquito populations 
through the physical elimination of all breeding sites, in private and public spaces, and 
through the use of larvicides in breeding places that cannot be eliminated. The biological 

larvicide with 
Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis
 toxins are recommended because of the 
lack of resistance and no environmental drawback.

protection in the working places and schools, elimination of breeding sites, installation of window 

screens, and overall surveillance of the environment to make it less favorable for mosquitoes, are 

some of the major actions that can be taken by communities.
