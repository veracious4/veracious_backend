 Most experts think that flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk.
 These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
 Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.
 When Flu Spreads People with flu are most contagious in the first three to four days after their illness begins.
 Most healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick.
 Children and some people with weakened immune systems may  pass the virus for longer than 7 days.
 Symptoms can begin about 2 days (but can range from 1 to 4 days)  after the virus enters the body.
 That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick.
 Some people can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms.
 During this time, those people may still spread the virus to others.
 Period of Contagiousness You may be able to pass on flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick.
 People with flu are most contagious in the first 3-4 days after their illness begins.
 Some otherwise healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick.
 Some people, especially young children and people with weakened immune systems, might be able to infect others with flu viruses for an even longer time.
