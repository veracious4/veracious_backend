 Doctors at Boston University believe they have discovered a way to diagnose the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy in living humans, TSN reported Tuesday.
 Researchers at BU studied the brains of 23 former football players, 50 non-athletes with Alzheimer’s and 18 non-athletes.
 “The findings of this study are the early steps towards identifying CTE during life,” said Ann McKee, director of BU’s CTE Center, according to TSN.
 “Once we can successfully identify CTE in living individuals, we will be much closer to discovering treatments for those who suffer from it.” To this point, CTE has only been diagnosed after death by studying preserved brains.
 A recent study of brains from 202 deceased football players found CTE in 87 percent (177), including 110 of 111 people who played in the NFL.
 A lawyer for ex-Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez also recently revealed his client had an advanced case of CTE.
 Hernandez committed suicide at 27 while serving a life sentence for murder, a crime he committed while playing for the Patriots.
 He only played three years of college football and three years in the NFL, but a study of Hernandez’s brain showed a stage of CTE normally associated with a median age of death of 67 years.
 Professional sports leagues have tried to distance themselves from the disease and the cause-and-effect of playing contact sports, but this could lead to significant advances in diagnosing and treating people who develop CTE.
 “To me, it feels like maybe now we can start going in the other direction,” McKee said to the Washington Post.
 “We’ve been going down, and everything has just gotten more and more depressing.
