BE BEST will concentrate on three main pillars: well-being, online safety, and opioid abuse.
 BE BEST will champion the many successful well-being programs that provide children with the tools and skills required for emotional, social, and physical health.
 The campaign will also promote established organizations, programs, and people who are helping children overcome some of the issues they face growing up in the modern world.
 “Over the past two years, Be Best has played a major role in spreading awareness, highlighting successful programs and acts of kindness, and encouraging public-private sector relationships to help children overcome the struggles they face every day,” said First Lady Melania Trump.

 With those values as a solid foundation, children will be able to better deal with the evils of the opioid crisis and avoid negative social media interaction.
