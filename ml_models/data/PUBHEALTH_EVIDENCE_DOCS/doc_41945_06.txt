 PURPOSES.
 The purposes of this title are to--   (1) substantially increase the number of law enforcement   officers interacting directly with members of the community (``cops   on the beat'');   (2) provide additional and more effective training to law   enforcement officers to enhance their problem solving, service, and   other skills needed in interacting with members of the community;   (3) encourage the development and implementation of innovative   programs to permit members of the community to assist State, Indian   tribal government, and local law enforcement agencies in the   prevention of crime in the community; and   (4) encourage the development of new technologies to assist   State, Indian tribal government, and local law enforcement agencies   in reorienting the emphasis of their activities from reacting to   crime to preventing crime, by establishing a program of grants and assistance in furtherance of  these objectives, including the authorization for a period of 6 years  of grants for the hiring and rehiring of additional career law  enforcement officers.

 ``(2) Grants for equipment, technology, and support systems.--  Grants pursuant to paragraph (1)(C)--    ``(A) may not exceed--     ``(i) 20 percent of the funds available for grants     pursuant to this subsection in fiscal year 1995;     ``(ii) 20 percent of the funds available for grants     pursuant to this subsection in fiscal year 1996; or     ``(iii) 10 percent of the funds available for grants     pursuant to this subsection in fiscal years 1997, 1998,     1999, and 2000; and    ``(B) may not be awarded in fiscal years 1998, 1999, or    2000 unless the Attorney General has certified that grants    awarded in fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997 pursuant to    subparagraph (1)(C) have resulted in an increase in the number    of officers deployed in community-oriented policing equal to or    greater than the increase in the number of officers that have    resulted from the grants in like amounts awarded in fiscal    years 1995, 1996, and 1997 pursuant to paragraph (1) (A) and    (B).
 ``(c) Troops-to-Cops Programs.--   ``(1) In general.--Grants made under subsection (a) may be used   to hire former members of the Armed Forces to serve as career law   enforcement officers for deployment in community-oriented policing,   particularly in communities that are adversely affected by a recent   military base closing.

 ``(3) Training centers and facilities.--The technical   assistance provided by the Attorney General may include the   establishment and operation of training centers or facilities,   either directly or by contracting or cooperative arrangements.
 The   functions of the centers or facilities established under this   paragraph may include instruction and seminars for police   executives, managers, trainers, supervisors, and such others as the   Attorney General considers to be appropriate concerning community   or problem-oriented policing and improvements in police-community   interaction and cooperation that further the purposes of the Public   Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994.
 ``(g) Utilization of Components.--The Attorney General may utilize  any component or components of the Department of Justice in carrying  out this part.
 ``(h) Minimum Amount.--Unless all applications submitted by any  State and grantee within the State pursuant to subsection (a) have been  funded, each qualifying State, together with grantees within the State,  shall receive in each fiscal year pursuant to subsection (a) not less  than 0.5 percent of the total amount appropriated in the fiscal year  for grants pursuant to that subsection.
 In this subsection, `qualifying  State' means any State which has submitted an application for a grant,  or in which an eligible entity has submitted an application for a  grant, which meets the requirements prescribed by the Attorney General  and the conditions set out in this part.

 In  relation to a grant for a period exceeding 1 year for hiring or  rehiring career law enforcement officers, the Federal share shall  decrease from year to year for up to 5 years, looking toward the  continuation of the increased hiring level using State or local sources  of funding following the conclusion of Federal support, as provided in  an approved plan pursuant to section 1702(c)(8).
 ``(j) Allocation of Funds.--The funds available under this part  shall be allocated as provided in section 1001(a)(11)(B).

 ``(4) Order mandatory.--(A) The issuance of a restitution order   under this section is mandatory.
 ``(B) A court may not decline to issue an order under this   section because of--    ``(i) the economic circumstances of the defendant; or    ``(ii) the fact that a victim has, or is entitled to,    receive compensation for his or her injuries from the proceeds    of insurance or any other source.
 ``(C)(i) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the court may take   into account the economic circumstances of the defendant in   determining the manner in which and the schedule according to which   the restitution is to be paid.

 If objection is   raised, the court may require the victim or the United States   Attorney (or the United States Attorney's delegee) to submit   further affidavits or other supporting documents, demonstrating the   victim's losses.
 ``(3) Additional documentation and testimony.--If the court   concludes, after reviewing the supporting documentation and   considering the defendant's objections, that there is a substantial   reason for doubting the authenticity or veracity of the records   submitted, the court may require additional documentation or hear   testimony on those questions.

 ``(e) Reference to Magistrate or Special Master.--The court may  refer any issue arising in connection with a proposed order of  restitution to a magistrate or special master for proposed findings of  fact and recommendations as to disposition, subject to a de novo  determination of the issue by the court.

 (b) Report and Recommendations.--Not later than the date that is 1  year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General  shall report to the Congress--   (1) the findings of the study and the model legislation   required by this section; and   (2) recommendations based on the findings on the need for and   appropriateness of further action by the Federal Government.
 (c) Review of Federal Evidentiary Rules.--The Judicial Conference  of the United States shall evaluate and report to Congress its views on  whether the Federal Rules of Evidence should be amended, and if so, how  they should be amended, to guarantee that the confidentiality of  communications between sexual assault victims and their therapists or  trained counselors will be adequately protected in Federal court  proceedings.

 ``Sec.
 2264.
 Restitution   ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 3663, and in addition to  any other civil or criminal penalty authorized by law, the court shall  order restitution for any offense under this chapter.
 ``(b) Scope and Nature of Order.--   ``(1) Directions.--The order of restitution under this section   shall direct that--    ``(A) the defendant pay to the victim (through the    appropriate court mechanism) the full amount of the victim's    losses as determined by the court, pursuant to paragraph (3);    and    ``(B) the United States Attorney enforce the restitution    order by all available and reasonable means.
 ``(2) Enforcement by victim.--An order of restitution also may   be enforced by a victim named in the order to receive the   restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.
 ``(3) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the term   `full amount of the victim's losses' includes any costs incurred by   the victim for--    ``(A) medical services relating to physical, psychiatric,    or psychological care;    ``(B) physical and occupational therapy or rehabilitation;    ``(C) necessary transportation, temporary housing, and    child care expenses;    ``(D) lost income;    ``(E) attorneys' fees, plus any costs incurred in obtaining    a civil protection order; and    ``(F) any other losses suffered by the victim as a    proximate result of the offense.
 ``(4) Order mandatory.--(A) The issuance of a restitution order   under this section is mandatory.
 ``(B) A court may not decline to issue an order under this   section because of--    ``(i) the economic circumstances of the defendant; or    ``(ii) the fact that a victim has, or is entitled to,    receive compensation for his or her injuries from the proceeds    of insurance or any other source.
 ``(C)(i) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the court may take   into account the economic circumstances of the defendant in   determining the manner in which and the schedule according to which   the restitution is to be paid.
 ``(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `economic   circumstances' includes--    ``(I) the financial resources and other assets of the    defendant;    ``(II) projected earnings, earning capacity, and other    income of the defendant; and    ``(III) any financial obligations of the defendant,    including obligations to dependents.
 ``(D) Subparagraph (A) does not apply if--    ``(i) the court finds on the record that the economic    circumstances of the defendant do not allow for the payment of    any amount of a restitution order, and do not allow for the    payment of any or some portion of the amount of a restitution    order in the foreseeable future (under any reasonable schedule    of payments); and    ``(ii) the court enters in its order the amount of the    victim's losses, and provides a nominal restitution award.
 ``(5) More than 1 offender.--When the court finds that more   than 1 offender has contributed to the loss of a victim, the court   may make each offender liable for payment of the full amount of   restitution or may apportion liability among the offenders to   reflect the level of contribution and economic circumstances of   each offender.
 ``(6) More than 1 victim.--When the court finds that more than   1 victim has sustained a loss requiring restitution by an offender,   the court shall order full restitution of each victim but may   provide for different payment schedules to reflect the economic   circumstances of each victim.
 ``(7) Payment schedule.--An order under this section may direct   the defendant to make a single lump-sum payment or partial payments   at specified intervals.
 ``(8) Setoff.--Any amount paid to a victim under this section   shall be set off against any amount later recovered as compensatory   damages by the victim from the defendant in--    ``(A) any Federal civil proceeding; and    ``(B) any State civil proceeding, to the extent provided by    the law of the State.
 ``(9) Effect on other sources of compensation.--The issuance of   a restitution order shall not affect the entitlement of a victim to   receive compensation with respect to a loss from insurance or any   other source until the payments actually received by the victim   under the restitution order fully compensate the victim for the   loss.
 ``(10) Condition of probation or supervised release.--  Compliance with a restitution order issued under this section shall   be a condition of any probation or supervised release of a   defendant.
 If an offender fails to comply with a restitution order,   the court may, after a hearing, revoke probation or a term of   supervised release, modify the terms or conditions of probation or   a term of supervised release, or hold the defendant in contempt   pursuant to section 3583(e).
 In determining whether to revoke   probation or a term of supervised release, modify the terms or   conditions of probation or supervised release or hold a defendant   serving a term of supervised release in contempt, the court shall   consider the defendant's employment status, earning ability and   financial resources, the willfulness of the defendant's failure to   comply, and any other circumstances that may have a bearing on the   defendant's ability to comply.
 ``(c) Affidavit.--Within 60 days after conviction and, in any  event, not later than 10 days before sentencing, the United States  Attorney (or such Attorney's delegate), after consulting with the  victim, shall prepare and file an affidavit with the court listing the  amounts subject to restitution under this section.
 The affidavit shall  be signed by the United States Attorney (or the delegate) and the  victim.
 Should the victim object to any of the information included in  the affidavit, the United States Attorney (or the delegate) shall  advise the victim that the victim may file a separate affidavit and  assist the victim in the preparation of the affidavit.
 ``(d) Objection.--If, after the defendant has been notified of the  affidavit, no objection is raised by the defendant, the amounts  attested to in the affidavit filed pursuant to subsection (a) shall be  entered in the court's restitution order.
 If objection is raised, the  court may require the victim or the United States Attorney (or the  United States Attorney's delegate) to submit further affidavits or  other supporting documents, demonstrating the victim's losses.
 ``(e) Additional Documentation and Testimony.--If the court  concludes, after reviewing the supporting documentation and considering  the defendant's objections, that there is a substantial reason for  doubting the authenticity or veracity of the records submitted, the  court may require additional documentation or hear testimony on those  questions.
 The privacy of any records filed, or testimony heard,  pursuant to this section, shall be maintained to the greatest extent  possible, and such records may be filed or testimony heard in camera.
 ``(f) Final Determination of Losses.--If the victim's losses are  not ascertainable 10 days before sentencing as provided in subsection  (c), the United States Attorney (or the United States Attorney's  delegate) shall so inform the court, and the court shall set a date for  the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days  after sentencing.
 If the victim subsequently discovers further losses,  the victim shall have 90 days after discovery of those losses in which  to petition the court for an amended restitution order.
 Such order may  be granted only upon a showing of good cause for the failure to include  such losses in the initial claim for restitutionary relief.
 ``(g) Restitution in Addition to Punishment.--An award of  restitution to the victim of an offense under this chapter is not a  substitute for imposition of punishment under this chapter.

 2265.

 ``(b) Protection Order.--A protection order issued by a State or  tribal court is consistent with this subsection if--   ``(1) such court has jurisdiction over the parties and matter   under the law of such State or Indian tribe; and   ``(2) reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard is given to   the person against whom the order is sought sufficient to protect   that person's right to due process.
 In the case of ex parte orders,   notice and opportunity to be heard must be provided within the time   required by State or tribal law, and in any event within a   reasonable time after the order is issued, sufficient to protect   the respondent's due process rights.
 ``(c) Cross or Counter Petition.--A protection order issued by a  State or tribal court against one who has petitioned, filed a  complaint, or otherwise filed a written pleading for protection against  abuse by a spouse or intimate partner is not entitled to full faith and  credit if--   ``(1) no cross or counter petition, complaint, or other written   pleading was filed seeking such a protection order; or   ``(2) a cross or counter petition has been filed and the court   did not make specific findings that each party was entitled to such   an order.

 Special hearing to determine whether a sentence of death     is justified   ``(a) Notice by the Government.--If, in a case involving an offense  described in section 3591, the attorney for the government believes  that the circumstances of the offense are such that a sentence of death  is justified under this chapter, the attorney shall, a reasonable time  before the trial or before acceptance by the court of a plea of guilty,  sign and file with the court, and serve on the defendant, a notice--   ``(1) stating that the government believes that the   circumstances of the offense are such that, if the defendant is   convicted, a sentence of death is justified under this chapter and   that the government will seek the sentence of death; and   ``(2) setting forth the aggravating factor or factors that the   government, if the defendant is convicted, proposes to prove as   justifying a sentence of death.
 The factors for which notice is provided under this subsection may  include factors concerning the effect of the offense on the victim and  the victim's family, and may include oral testimony, a victim impact  statement that identifies the victim of the offense and the extent and  scope of the injury and loss suffered by the victim and the victim's  family, and any other relevant information.

 Based upon this consideration, the jury by unanimous  vote, or if there is no jury, the court, shall recommend whether the  defendant should be sentenced to death, to life imprisonment without  possibility of release or some other lesser sentence.
 ``(f) Special Precaution To Ensure Against Discrimination.--In a  hearing held before a jury, the court, prior to the return of a finding  under subsection (e), shall instruct the jury that, in considering  whether a sentence of death is justified, it shall not consider the  race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the  defendant or of any victim and that the jury is not to recommend a  sentence of death unless it has concluded that it would recommend a  sentence of death for the crime in question no matter what the race,  color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or  of any victim may be.
 The jury, upon return of a finding under  subsection (e), shall also return to the court a certificate, signed by  each juror, that consideration of the race, color, religious beliefs,  national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim was not involved  in reaching his or her individual decision and that the individual  juror would have made the same recommendation regarding a sentence for  the crime in question no matter what the race, color, religious  beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim may be.

 ``(2) Whenever the court of appeals finds that--    ``(A) the sentence of death was imposed under the influence    of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor;    ``(B) the admissible evidence and information adduced does    not support the special finding of the existence of the    required aggravating factor; or    ``(C) the proceedings involved any other legal error    requiring reversal of the sentence that was properly preserved    for appeal under the rules of criminal procedure,   the court shall remand the case for reconsideration under section   3593 or imposition of a sentence other than death.

 ASYLUM.
 (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--   (1) in the last decade applications for asylum have greatly   exceeded the original 5,000 annual limit provided in the Refugee   Act of 1980, with more than 150,000 asylum applications filed in   fiscal year 1993, and the backlog of cases growing to 340,000;   (2) this flood of asylum claims has swamped the system,   creating delays in the processing of applications of up to several   years;   (3) the delay in processing asylum claims due to the   overwhelming numbers has contributed to numerous problems,   including--    (A) an abuse of the asylum laws by fraudulent applicants    whose primary interest is obtaining work authority in the    United States while their claim languishes in the backlogged    asylum processing system;    (B) the growth of alien smuggling operations, often    involving organized crime;    (C) a drain on limited resources resulting from the high    cost of processing frivolous asylum claims through our    multilayered system; and    (D) an erosion of public support for asylum, which is a    treaty obligation.
 (4) asylum, a safe haven protection for aliens abroad who   cannot return home, has been perverted by some aliens who use   asylum claims to circumvent our immigration and refugee laws and   procedures; and   (5) a comprehensive revision of our asylum law and procedures   is required to address these problems.
 (b) Policy.--It is the sense of the Senate that--   (1) asylum is a process intended to protect aliens in the   United States who cannot safely return home;   (2) persons outside their country of nationality who have a   well-founded fear of persecution if they return should apply for   refugee status at one of our refugee processing offices abroad; and   (3) the immigration, refugee and asylum laws of the United   States should be reformed to provide--    (A) a procedure for the expeditious exclusion of any asylum    applicant who arrives at a port-of-entry with fraudulent    documents, or no documents, and makes a noncredible claim of    asylum; and    (B) the immigration, refugee and asylum laws of the United    States should be reformed to provide for a streamlined    affirmative asylum processing system for asylum applicants who    make their application after they have entered the United    States.

 (b) Uniform Decal or Device Designs.--   (1) In general.--The motor vehicle theft prevention program   developed pursuant to this section shall include a uniform design   or designs for decals or other devices to be displayed by motor   vehicles participating in the program.
 (2) Type of design.--The uniform design shall--    (A) be highly visible; and    (B) explicitly state that the motor vehicle to which it is    affixed may be stopped under the specified conditions without    additional grounds for establishing a reasonable suspicion that    the vehicle is being operated unlawfully.
 (c) Voluntary Consent Form.--The voluntary consent form used to  enroll in the program shall--   (1) clearly state that participation in the program is   voluntary;   (2) clearly explain that participation in the program means   that, if the participating vehicle is being operated under the   specified conditions, law enforcement officials may stop the   vehicle and take reasonable steps to determine whether it is being   operated by or with the consent of the owner, even if the law   enforcement officials have no other basis for believing that the   vehicle is being operated unlawfully;   (3) include an express statement that the vehicle is not   normally operated under the specified conditions and that the   operation of the vehicle under those conditions would provide   sufficient grounds for a prudent law enforcement officer to   reasonably believe that the vehicle was not being operated by or   with the consent of the owner; and   (4) include any additional information that the Attorney   General may reasonably require.
 (d) Specified Conditions Under Which Stops May Be Authorized.--   (1) In general.--The Attorney General shall promulgate rules   establishing the conditions under which participating motor   vehicles may be authorized to be stopped under this section.

 The Attorney General may choose to satisfy the   requirement of a separate design for program decals or devices   under this paragraph by the use of a design color that is clearly   distinguishable from other design colors.
 (3) No new conditions without consent.--After the program has   begun, the conditions under which a vehicle may be stopped if   affixed with a certain decal or device design may not be expanded   without the consent of the owner.
 (4) Limited participation by states and localities.--A State or   locality need not authorize the stopping of motor vehicles under   all sets of conditions specified under the program in order to   participate in the program.
 (e) Motor Vehicles for Hire.--   (1) Notification to lessees.--Any person who is in the business   of renting or leasing motor vehicles and who rents or leases a   motor vehicle on which a program decal or device is affixed shall,   prior to transferring possession of the vehicle, notify the person   to whom the motor vehicle is rented or leased about the program.
 (2) Type of notice.--The notice required by this subsection   shall--    (A) be in writing;    (B) be in a prominent format to be determined by the    Attorney General; and    (C) explain the possibility that if the motor vehicle is    operated under the specified conditions, the vehicle may be    stopped by law enforcement officials even if the officials have    no other basis for believing that the vehicle is being operated    unlawfully.
 (3) Fine for failure to provide notice.--Failure to provide   proper notice under this subsection shall be punishable by a fine   not to exceed $5,000.
 (f) Notification of Police.--As a condition of participating in the  program, a State or locality must agree to take reasonable steps to  ensure that law enforcement officials throughout the State or locality  are familiar with the program, and with the conditions under which  motor vehicles may be stopped under the program.

 ``(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `economic   circumstances' includes--    ``(I) the financial resources and other assets of the    defendant;    ``(II) projected earnings, earning capacity, and other    income of the defendant; and    ``(III) any financial obligations of the defendant,    including obligations to dependents.
 ``(D) Subparagraph (A) does not apply if--    ``(i) the court finds on the record that the economic    circumstances of the defendant do not allow for the payment of    any amount of a restitution order, and do not allow for the    payment of any or some portion of the amount of a restitution    order in the foreseeable future (under any reasonable schedule    of payments); and    ``(ii) the court enters in its order the amount of the    victim's losses, and provides a nominal restitution award.
 ``(5) More than 1 offender.--When the court finds that more   than 1 offender has contributed to the loss of a victim, the court   may make each offender liable for payment of the full amount of   restitution or may apportion liability among the offenders to   reflect the level of contribution and economic circumstances of   each offender.
 ``(6) More than 1 victim.--When the court finds that more than   1 victim has sustained a loss requiring restitution by an offender,   the court shall order full restitution of each victim but may   provide for different payment schedules to reflect the economic   circumstances of each victim.

 ``(9) Effect on other sources of compensation.--The issuance of   a restitution order shall not affect the entitlement of a victim to   receive compensation with respect to a loss from insurance or any   other source until the payments actually received by the victim   under the restitution order fully compensate the victim for the   loss.
 ``(10) Condition of probation or supervised release.--  Compliance with a restitution issued under this section shall be a   condition of any probation or supervised release of a defendant.
 The court may revoke probation or a term of supervised release,   modify the terms or conditions of probation or a term of supervised   release, hold the defendant in contempt pursuant to section   3583(e), or suspend the offender's eligibility for any grant,   contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license   provided by an agency of the United States or with appropriated   funds of the United States if the defendant fails to comply with   the order.
 In determining whether to revoke probation or a term of   supervised release, modify the terms or conditions of probation or   supervised release or hold a defendant serving a term of supervised   release in contempt, the court shall consider the defendant's   employment status, earning ability and financial resources, the   willfulness of the defendant's failure to comply, and any other   circumstances that may have a bearing on the defendant's ability to   comply.
 ``(c) Proof of Claim.--   ``(1) Affidavit.--Within 60 days after conviction and, in any   event, not later than 10 days prior to sentencing, the United   States Attorney (or the United States Attorney's delegee), after   consulting with the victim, shall prepare and file an affidavit   with the court listing the amounts subject to restitution under   this section.
 The affidavit shall be signed by the United States   Attorney (or the United States Attorney's delegee) and the victim.
 Should the victim object to any of the information included in the   affidavit, the United States Attorney (or the United States   Attorney's delegee) shall advise the victim that the victim may   file a separate affidavit and shall provide the victim with an   affidavit form which may be used to do so.
 ``(2) Objection.--If, after the defendant has been notified of   the affidavit, no objection is raised by the defendant, the amounts   attested to in the affidavit filed pursuant to paragraph (1) shall   be entered in the court's restitution order.
 If objection is   raised, the court may require the victim or the United States   Attorney (or the United States Attorney's delegee) to submit   further affidavits or other supporting documents, demonstrating the   victim's losses.
 ``(3) Additional documentation and testimony.--If the court   concludes, after reviewing the supporting documentation and   considering the defendant's objections, that there is a substantial   reason for doubting the authenticity or veracity of the records   submitted, the court may require additional documentation or hear   testimony on those questions.
 The privacy of any records filed, or   testimony heard, pursuant to this section shall be maintained to   the greatest extent possible, and such records may be filed or   testimony heard in camera.
 ``(4) Final determination of losses.--If the victim's losses   are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to   sentencing as provided in paragraph (1), the United States Attorney   (or the United States Attorney's delegee) shall so inform the   court, and the court shall set a date for the final determination   of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.
 If   the victim subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall   have 60 days after discovery of those losses in which to petition   the court for an amended restitution order.
 Such order may be   granted only upon a showing of good cause for the failure to   include such losses in the initial claim for restitutionary relief.
 ``(d) Modification of Order.--A victim or the offender may petition  the court at any time to modify a restitution order as appropriate in  view of a change in the economic circumstances of the offender.
 ``(e) Reference to Magistrate or Special Master.--The court may  refer any issue arising in connection with a proposed order of  restitution to a magistrate or special master for proposed findings of  fact and recommendations as to disposition, subject to a de novo  determination of the issue by the court.
 ``(f) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term `victim'  includes the individual harmed as a result of a commission of a crime  under this chapter, including, in the case of a victim who is  incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardian of the  victim or representative of the victim's estate, another family member,  or any other person appointed as suitable by the court, but in no event  shall the defendant be named as such representative or guardian.''.
