 Newly developed genomic resources have expanded our understanding of canine evolutionary history and dog origins.
 Domestication involved genetic contributions from multiple populations of gray wolves probably through backcrossing.
 Consequently, genome-wide association and selective sweep scans now allow the discovery of genes underlying breed-specific characteristics.
