 Methods:           We analyzed data from the 2013-14 influenza season and used propensity score matching to account for the probability of vaccination within age strata (18-49, 50-64, and ≥65 years).
 Death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and hospital and ICU lengths of stay (LOS) were outcome measures for severity.
 Conclusions:           Influenza vaccination during 2013-14 influenza season attenuated adverse outcome among adults that were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza.
 Keywords:              Influenza vaccination; adults; disease severity.
