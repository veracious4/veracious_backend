 You may bind with `on` or remove with `off` callback functions // to an event; trigger`-ing an event fires all callbacks in succession.
 Returns a reference to  // the Eventify object.
 Passing `"all"` will bind  // the callback to all events fired.
 After the first time  // the callback is invoked, it will be removed.
 If `context` is null, removes all  // callbacks with that function.
 If `callback` is null, removes all  // callbacks for the event.
 If `name` is null, removes all bound  // callbacks for all events.
 The predicate is invoked with two arguments: (value, key).

 *  * **Note:** This method is loosely based on  * [`ToLength`](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/#sec-tolength).
 A value is considered array-like if it's  * not a function and has a `value.length` that's an integer greater than or  * equal to `0` and less than or equal to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.
 *  * **Note:** Non-object values are coerced to objects.
 An empty string is returned for `null`  * and `undefined` values.
 The sign of `-0` is preserved.

 The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel  * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.
 * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the  * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout.
 The `func` is invoked  * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function.
 Subsequent  * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`  * invocation.
 *  * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is  * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function  * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.
 *  * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred  * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.
 *  * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)  * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.
 * @example  *  * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.
 * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));  *  * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.

 * The iteratee is invoked with three arguments: (value, index|key, collection).
 * Iteratee functions may exit iteration early by explicitly returning `false`.

 To avoid this behavior use `_.forIn`  * or `_.forOwn` for object iteration.
