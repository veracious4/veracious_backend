 a. This dir
ective applies to all archival Federal records scheduled as permanent 
including those properly accessioned into the legal custody of the 
National 
Archives of 
the United States
, with the exception of those records listed in subpara. (b). 
It includes 
records in 
NARA™s p
hysical custody and 
records in the physical 
custody of affiliated 
archives.
 b. This directive does not apply to:  
(1)
 Records that are unscheduled or scheduled as temporary under an 
approved records schedule but that have been sent incorrectly to the 
physical custody of archi
val units of the National Archives either because 
they are mixed into accessions of permanent archival records or because 

they are mistakenly sent as permanent records under a misapplicatio
n of 
disposition authorities (but see para. 1540.9); 
(2)
 Donated hi
storical materials;
 (3)
 President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records as defined in 44 U.S.C.

1540.5 Definitions.
 a. Reappraisal
 Œ The process of reevaluating the historical value and thus the final 
disposition of Federal records.  R
eappraisal of permanent records changes
 an approved 
disposition authority from permanent to temporary for either a discrete set or an entire 

series of records.  Reappraisal can apply to records in NARA™s legal custody and/or 

records in an agency™s legal custody.
  NARA 1540
 February 4, 2013 
3 (1)
 Reappraisal of permanent records in NARA™s legal custody: The 
permanent removal of a discrete set of an accessioned series of re
cords 

from NARA™s physical and legal custody, from any number of physical 

locations (up to and including all physical locations), because they have 

been reappraised as temporary, without affecting the existing disposition 

authority for any remaining record
s, is known as ﬁInternal Disposal.ﬂ  
This 
removal can result in the records being destroyed, permanently returned to 

an agency, or donated to another organization. 
(2) 
 Reappraisal of permanent records in an agency™s legal custody: The 

process of reeval
uating the value and thus the disposition authority for 
Federal records
 in the custody of a Federal agency (reappraisal of an 
ongoing series of records)
 results in the changing
 of an approved 
disposition authority from permanent to temporary for a whole se
ries or 
records schedule item.  The new authority supersedes the previous 

permanent authority and applies to records 
still in the agency™s custody.
 b. Deaccessioning
 Œ Removing a discrete set of Federal records from NARA™s legal 
and physical custody.  
There are two types of deaccessioning actions:  internal disposal 
and permanent withdrawal.  
(1)
 Internal Disposal Œ 
The permanent removal of a discrete set of an 
accessioned series of records from NARA™s physical and legal custody, 

from any number of physical locations (up to and including all physical 

locations), because they have been reappraised as temporary, without 

affecting the existing disposition authority for any remaining records.  

This removal can result in the records being destroyed, permanently
 returned to an agency, or donated to another organization. 
 (2)
 Permanent Withdrawal* 
Œ The removal of a discrete set of an accessioned 
series of records from NARA™s physical and/or legal custody; the records 

retain their appraised permanent value and 
must not be destroyed.  A 

permanent withdrawal is an infrequent, unusual action that generally 

happens at the request of a 
Federal agency because the agency has an 

expressed business need for the return of the records.  They can also result 

from a loan that is unrecoverable.  
When records are permanently 
withdrawn to be returned to an agency, NARA staff should reevaluate the 

transfer instructions for the series in th
e associated records schedule.

Program pert
ain to non-
acces
sioned records.

ses 
custodial units 
with reappraisal
 and deaccessioning justification 
when requested; and
 (2)
 Processes records schedules.
 h. General Counsel
 reviews for legal sufficiency the schedules and justifications for 
Internal Disposal recommendations. 
1540.7 Why c
ould records be 
proposed for internal disposal or permanent 
withdrawal? 
a. In de
ciding to remove records from NARA™s legal and physical custody, 
staff 
should be aware of and take into account the guidelines in NARA 1441, Appraisal Policy 
of the National Archives and Records Administration. 
 NARA 1540
 February 4, 2013 
5 b. Archival staff may conclude that accessioned records 
merit internal disposal 
because they 
do not have permanent administrative, legal, research, or other permanent 
value for the following reasons including, but not limited to: 
(1)
 Experience working with the records reveals 
they do not have adequate 

evidential value because 
the files do not contain sufficiently detailed or 
complete information about the substance and outcome of the policies, 

cases, 
projects or other actions of the Federal government that the records 

were thought to document; 
(2)
 Experience working with the records reveals they do not have adequate 

informational value because they do not contain sufficient information 

about American history, genealogy, scientific data, or other informational 

values that the records were thought to document; or 
(3)
 Records have problems of physical integrity that prevents retrieving their 
evide
ntial or informational content.
 For electronic records, lack of 
adequate documentation to interpret the contents of structured data files or 

computer-
readable media may be a basis for internal disposal.
 c.  Archival staff may conclude that accessioned reco
rds 
are subject to permanent 
withdrawal because:
 (1)
 Continuous, recurrent use by the originating agency through long term, 
unreturned loans or by large volumes of reference requests from the 

agency for copies of, or for information from, 
the records for i
ts work 
makes it clear that the records are still very important for ongoing 

functions and programs of the originator and that transfer of the records to 

NARA was premature; or
 (2) 
 The 
Archivist determine
s 
it is in the public interest to establish 
an 
affi
liated archive.  The criteria for establishing an affiliated archive are in 
NARA 1501, Custody of Federal Records of Archival Value, and the 

procedures are in NARA 1502, Procedures for Processing Proposals for 

Affiliated Archives.
  
1540.8 If a 
new 
records 
schedule submitted by an agency changes the disposition of 
records in 
their
 custody from permanent to temporary, may 
I simply
 apply the 
agency™s new disposition authority retroactively to accessioned records
 in 
NARA™s
 legal 
custody
? 
No.  If a records schedule submitted by an agency changes the disposition of records in 
its custody from permanent to temporary, archival staff 
may
 propose internal disposal of 
accessioned records which are the same as those identified in the new records schedule by 

applying the criteria found in subpara. 1540.7b. NARA may not simply apply the agency™s new 

disposition authority retroactively to accessioned records. 
 NARA 1540
 February 4, 2013 
6 1540.9 How do I dispose of 
temporary records
 that are co
-mingled with permanent 
records in an
 accession 
that was made prior to September 1994 
(when a change 
was made to the language on the SF-258)? 
You must follow the procedures for an internal disposal for records received under an SF-258 
prior to September 1994. This is beca
use before the change
 to the SF-258 in September, 1994, 
the form did not include the authorization by the agencies to dispose of records scheduled as 

temporary in either the General Records Schedule or in an agency schedule.
 1540.10 What 
different kinds of actions can be taken
 with records 
approved for removal 
from NARA™s legal 
and/or physical 
custody
 through internal disposals or 
permanent 
withdrawals? 
a. Records approved for Internal Disposal may be: 
(1)
 Destroyed 
as temporary records under an approved records schedule.  

Proper disposal methods must be followed for records that are security 

classified, contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or include 

other types of sensitive information. 
(2)
 Donated to a non-
Federal
 organization or institution per the standards and 
procedures in 36 CFR 1226.26.  Records that could not be opened to the 

public in their entirety for privacy or security reasons are typically not 

suitable for donation to a non-
Federal organization.
 (3)
 Returned to the legal custody of the originatin
g Federal entity and 
removed from 
NARA™s archival storage space.
 b. Records approved for Permanent Withdrawal may be: 
(1)
 Physically transferred to an affiliated archive, per NARA 1501 and NARA 

1502, if doing so is d
etermined by the Archivist 
to be in the public 

interest.
 (2)
 Returned to the legal custody of the originating Federal entity and 
removed from 
NARA™s archival storage space.
 1540.11 What happens if an agency disagrees with a proposed internal disposal?
 Generally, NARA will retain the records a
s permanent.  However, i
n the event that an agency 
does not agree with NARA's decision to dispose of the records, the issue should be elevated to 

the attention of senior management, including the CRO, the Executive for Research Services, 

NGC, and the Archivist, to make a further case to the agency.  NARA reserves the right to 

consider, on a case by case basis, whether to withdraw the permanent disposition of the records 

so as to return them to the legal custody of the agency.

 a. Custodial units Œ including Washington, DC, area units and 
regional archives 
-- initiate 
reappraisal and the resultant internal disposal of 
records in their custody.  
An 
internal disposal proposal is 
prepared by 
the NARA 
archival staff 
member(s) 
familiar 
with the records and is approved by the unit head
.  Proposals 
must 
include 
the 
following 

documentation: 
(1)
 SF-115, Request for Records Disposition Authority
, for the
 internal 
disposal.  
The SF
-115s for internal dispo
sals are filled out as follows:
 Block 1, From (Agency or Establishment)
:  National Archives and 
Records Administration
 Block 2, Major Subdivision
:  Research Services; or Legislati
ve Archives, 
Presidential Libraries, and Museum Services
. 
Block 3, Minor Subdivision
:  NARA unit with custody of the records
.  If 
the SF
-115 applies to multiple custodial units, list them all in this 
block. 
Block 4, 
Name of 
Person with Whom to Confer
:  Name
 of staff member 
who prepared the SF-115. 
Block 6, Agency C
ertification
:  Check the box indicating that GAO 
concurrence is not needed. 
Block 6, S
ignature of 
Agency R
epresentative
:  Unit head with custody of 
the records
.  If the SF-115 applies to multiple custodial units, 
select one custodial unit to act as lead and sign in Block 6; 
for the 

other 
applicable 
custodial unit heads, a signature line(s) should be 
added to Block 8 and the head(s) should sign 
there.
 Block 7, Item No
.: Should contain item numbers of the records identified 
on the form in sequence, beginning with ﬁ1.ﬂ  Lower case letters 

and numbers may be used to designate subdivisions of an item (1a, 

1b, 1b(1), 1b(2), etc.).

Proposed D
isposition
:  Records are 
descri
bed in accordance with the guidelines in ﬁDisposition of 
Federal Recordsﬂ.  This block must clearly identify the creating 

agency and the date span
; if you need additional pages, attach a 
Word document to the SF-115. The proposed disposition is usually 

ﬁDestroy immediatelyﬂ. 
If records are to be donated, the 
disposition instructions should read ﬁDispose of immediately by 
 NARA 1540, Appendix A 
February 4, 2013 
A-2 
donation to [name of institution].ﬂ  In rare instances, records, while 
temporary, may not appropriate for immediate disposal.  In such 

instances, the proposed disposition would read ﬁReturn to legal 

custody of [agency of origin]. Retain for _____ years.ﬂ  (When 

such situations arise, archival staff in custodial units should consult 

with ACNR concerning the proposed retention period.) 
 (2) Appraisal memorandum that details the background of the records™ 
appraisal, accession
ing, and reference use history, 
present
s 
a clear 
justification for 
internal disposal, and 
states that 
the 
disp
osal is in the 
public interest.
 (3)
 NA Form 13174, Internal Review of Reappraisal \ 
Deaccessioning 
Proposal 
if the SF
-115 covers records in multiple custodial units.  
This 
will provide these custodial units the opportunity to review the appraisal 

and to decide whether to opt-
in to this SF
-115. 
(4)
 Contact ACNR for the Job Number which will be used to track this 
package.  ACNR registers the internal disposal job within 5 working days 

of receipt.  Internal disposal jobs are numbered in the same fashion as 

schedules submitted by agencies except
 that they are given the identifier 
N2 (rather than N1 or DAA).  The jobs are assigned to the Record Group 

of the agency creating the records (e.g., an internal disposal SF
-115 for 
State Department records is assigned to RG 59).
 b. Reviews may be coordinat
ed with other custodial units if there are records in 
other custodial units at other NARA locations that were accessioned under the same 

disposition authority 
and it is decided that the internal disposal at the initiating unit might 

apply to the same recor
ds in other units 
or if there are related records in other custodial 
units whose usefulness for researchers would be affected by the proposed disposal. 
(1)
 The initiating unit consults with its
 next supervisory level, which is 
its 
Access Coordinator in t
he case of Research Services, and together they 
determine if and which other custodial units should be consulted. 
(2)
 In Research Services the consultation includes all the Access Coordinators 
when records at different locations are involved. 
(3) 
Units ide
ntified as additional reviewers are sent a copy of the appraisal 
memorandum and draft SF 115 and they provide their views to the 

initiating unit on the 
NA Form 13174, Internal Review of Reapp
raisal 
\

(4) 
 When the records being r
eappraised are national security classified, the 
National Declassification
 Center (ANDC) 
must 
be 
informed
. 
c. 
After 
the revie
wing units have 
returned the 
NA Form 13174, Internal Review of 
Reappraisal 
\ Deaccessioning Proposal and appraisal memorandum
, the initiating 
 NARA 1540, Appendix A 
February 4, 2013 
A-3 
custodial unit completes an NA Form 13133, Recommendation to the Archivist on 
Records Di
sposition Request.  The unit head signs the NA 
Form 
13133 and then 
forwards 
the internal disposal request

if 
applicable
) for 
additional 
signature and concurrence on the NA 
Form 
13133 up through 
their chain of command 
to the Service Executive.
 (1)
 If there are disagreement
s, the higher level supervisor tries to resolve 
them. In Research Services, this is done by the Access Coordinators. 
(2)
 If agreement is not reached, the higher level supervisor forwards the 
package with a recommendation to the Service Executive for a decision. 
(3)
 If the final decisions entail applying the reappraisal to the same kind of 
records in other units and/or expanding the reappraisal to apply to related 

records, the initiating unit updates 
the 
SF 115 and the appraisal 

memorandum to reflect these c
hanges
. 
d.  If the Service Executive signs the NA 
Form 
13133 approving the internal 
disposal, the package is routed to the Office of the Chief Records Officer 
(AC) 
for review 

and signature.
 (1)
 The Chief Records Officer will circulate
 the
 package to appropriate 
ACNR appraisal staff
 for review
. 
(2)
 If the 
Office of the Chief Records Officer
 has issues or concerns, this will 
be documented in an explanatory memo 
from the Chief Records Officer 
to 

the Service Executive.  If the Service Executive
 decides to continue with 

the deaccessioning proposal, the Chief Records Officer will sign the NA 

Form 13133.   
(3)
 If the Chief Records Officer signs the NA Form 13133, they route the 
package to the General Counsel™s office.
 e. 
If the 
Chief Records Officer 
signs the NA 
Form 
13133 approving the 
internal 
disposal, the package is routed to the General Counsel™s of
fice for review and signature.
 (1)
 If the General Counsel™s office does not concur with the proposed internal 
disposal, they should return the package to the unit head with an 

explanatory memo.
 (2)
 If the General Counsel™s office signs the NA 
Form 
13133, they route the 
package to the National Records Management Program, 
Records 

Management Services 
Section
 Director
 (ACNR).
 f. 
An ACNR
 apprai
ser
 prepares a letter that is sent to the 
agency 
that originated 
the 
records
, enclosing 
the SF
-115 and requesting that the agency concurs by signing and 
returning a copy of the letter
 (ACNR should 
see Appendix 24 for an example).
  Such 
 NARA 1540, Appendix A 
February 4, 2013 
A-4 
letters are sent by the Director, ACNR
, after the ACNR appraiser has spoken with the 
agency records officer giving them a heads
-up the letter is coming
.  Normally, only the 
SF-115 is sent to the agency.  However, if the appraiser believes it would assist in 
securi
ng agency concurrence, he/she may also send the appraisal memorandum.
 (1)
 If the ACNR appraiser meets resistance from the agency, they can call on 
managers to meet with agency personnel to help explain and advocate for 

the proposal. 
g. If the agency concurs and signs 
the 
letter
, an 
ACNR 
appraiser prepares the 
Federal Register notice and submits it 
for publication through the Strategy Division.  
For 

the purposes of the notice, NARA is identified as the agency with either ﬁ
Research 
Servicesﬂ 
or 
ﬁLegislative Archives, Pre
sidential Libraries, and Museum Servicesﬂ as the 
major sub-division.  
The text of the notice identifies the creating agency
, provides a 
description of the 
records
 and
 the date span, and states that records were previously 
accessioned into the National Archives but lack historical value 
(ACNR should 
see 
Appendix 25 for an example).
 h. After the Federa
l Register process is completed
, an 
ACNR
 appraiser
 prepares the 
SF-115 dossier, including updating (with pen and ink)
 the 
NA Form 
13133 to reflect the 
date of Federal 
Register pu
blication, copies requested, and comments received.  
The 
ACNR 
appraiser 
routes the dossier for 
signatures from
 the Director, National Records

ACNR
 appraiser
 notifies the custodial unit director (i.e., the office of the first 
signature on the NA

reflect the change in holdings.

a result 
of step ﬁfﬂ above, the agency does not concur with a NARA-

these records
 retain 
their permanent value.

 ACNR will withdraw the SF

will make a request to the agency that the records be 
returned to the agency™s legal and physical custody.  If the agency agree
s to this request, 
this action is treated as a Permanent Withdrawal.
