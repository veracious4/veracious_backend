 The Kentucky Pain Research and Outcomes Study evaluated massage impact on pain, disability, and health-related quality of life for primary care patients with chronic low back pain.
 We report effectiveness and feasibility results, and make comparisons with established minimal clinically important differences.
 Methods:           Primary care providers referred eligible patients for 10 massage sessions with community practicing licensed massage therapists.
 Oswestry Disability Index and SF-36v2 measures obtained at baseline and postintervention at 12 and 24 weeks were analyzed with mixed linear models and Tukey's tests.
 Additional analyses examined clinically significant improvement and predictive patient characteristics.
 Results:           Of 104 enrolled patients, 85 and 76 completed 12 and 24 weeks of data collection, respectively.
 Group means improved at 12 weeks for all outcomes and at 24 weeks for SF-36v2's Physical Component Summary and Bodily Pain Domain.
