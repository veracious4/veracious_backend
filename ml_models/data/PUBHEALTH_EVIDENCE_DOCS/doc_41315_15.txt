Take special c
are with Rabies Vaccine BP
 
 
T
ell yo
ur doctor
 
or nurse
 
if
 
you or your child
:
 

 
has 
a history of allergy (such as hayfever or asthma) as there may be an incr
eased
 
risk of side 
effects.
 

 
has 
had any other reactions to
 
the vaccine when given before
.  Your doctor will decide whether 
to continue the
 
course and may decide to do a blood test to see if 
you or your child are 
protected. 
 

 
has 
any blood disorders such as haemophilia 
or thrombocytopenia 
(a condition where you bru
ise 
or bleed easily) because 
you or your child 
may get bleeding at the injection
 
site.
 

 
is under 1 year old.
 

 
has had any allergic reaction to latex. The tip cap of the pre
-
filled syringe contains a natural 
rubber latex derivative which may cause a severe allergic reaction.
 
 
As with all vaccines, Rabies Vaccine BP may not protect 100% o
f vaccinated people.
 
 
Your doctor
 
or nurse
 
will decide if 
you or your child 
should receive the vaccine.
 
 
Receiv
ing other vaccines or medicines
 
 
Immunosuppressive treatments, including long
-
term corticosteroid therapy, may interfere with antibody 
production
 
and cause the failure of the vaccination. It is therefore advisable to perform a serological test 2 to 
4 weeks after the last injection.
 
 
Separate injection sites and separate syringes must be used 
in case of concomitant administration with any
 
other
 
medi
cinal product
, including rabies immunoglobulin
.
 
 
As rabies immunoglobulin interferes with development of immune response to the vaccine, the 
recommendations concerning administration of rabies immunoglobulin must be strictly followed.
 
 
Please tell your doc
tor, 
nurse or 
pharmacist
 
if
 
you or your child are
 
taking or ha
ve
 
recently taken any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
 
 
Pregnancy
,
  
breast
-
feeding
 
and fertility
 
 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or breast
-
fe
eding tell the doctor or nurse.
 
There is no evidence that this vaccine affects the 
unborn baby 
or the outcome of pregnancy. The doctor
 
or 
nurse
 
will be able to decide if you should receive the vaccine.
 
 
The vaccine has not been evaluated for impairment of 
male or female fertility.
 
 
If you have been in contact with rabies, the doctor 
or nurse 
will usually decide to give you the vaccine 
because rabies is a serious disease.
 
 
If you have a high risk of coming into contact with rabies in the near future, the doc
tor 
or nurse 
may decide 
to give you a course of Rabies Vaccine BP to prevent infection.
 
 
Ask your doctor
,
 
nurse or 
pharmacist
 
for advice before taking any medicine.

HOW 
RABIES VACCINE BP
 
IS GIVEN
 
 
The
 
vaccination 
will 
be given by 
a doc
tor or nurse
. This
 
i
s
 
because they are 
 
trained in the use of 
v
accines
 
and 
are
 
equipped 
to deal with any uncommon severe allergic reaction to the injection
.
 
 
Dosage
 
The recommended dose is 1mL of reconstituted vaccine.

Pre
-
exposure prophylaxis
 
The primary pre
-
exposure immuni
sation course consists of 3 injections at Day 0, Day 7 and either Day 21 or 
Day 28.
 
If you are at regular or continuing risk of exposure to rabies
, 
your doctor or nurse will assess the need for 
further booster injections in line with official guidance.
 
 
 
P
ost
-
exposure prophylaxis
 
Post
-
exposure prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible after suspected rabies exposure.
 
In all cases, proper wound care (thorough flushing and washing of all bite wounds and scratches the wound 
with soap or detergent and
 
copious amounts of
 
water and/or virucidal agents) must be performed 
immediately or as soon as possible after exposure). It must be performed before administration of rabies
 
vaccine or rabies immunoglobulin, when they are indicated.
 
The rabies vaccine admi
nistration must be carried out by appropriately trained medical staff. It must be 
performed strictly in accordance with the category of
 
exposure, the patient immune status, and the animal 
status for rabies (according to local official recommendations, see 
Table 1 for WHO recommendations).
 
 
Table 1: WHO category of severity of exposure 
 
Category 
of 
exposure
 
Type of exposure to a domestic or 
wild animal suspected or confirmed 
to be rabid or animal unavailable for 
testing
 
Recommended post
-
exposure prophylaxis
 
I
 
 
Touching or feeding of animals
 
Licks on intact skin
 
(no exposure)
 
None, if reliable case history is available
a
 
 
II
 
Nibbling of uncovered skin
 
Minor scratches or abrasions without 
bleeding
 
(exposure)
 
Administer vaccine immediately
 
Stop treatment if ani
mal remains healthy throughout an 
observation period of 10 days
b
 
or is proven to be 
negative for rabies by a reliable laboratory using 
appropriate diagnostic techniques.
 
Treat as category III if bat exposure involved.
 
III
 
 
Single or multiple transdermal
c
 
bites or 
scratches, contamination of mucous 
membrane or broken skin with saliva 
from animal licks, exposures due to 
direct contact with bats.
 
(severe exposure)
 
Administer rabies vaccine immediately, and rabies 
immunoglobulin, preferably as soon as possible
 
after 
initiation of post
-
exposure prophylaxis. 
 
Rabies immunoglobulin can be injected up to 7 days 
after administration of first vaccine dose.
 
Stop treatment if animal remains healthy throughout an 
observation period of 10 days or is proven to be 
negative
 
for rabies by a reliable laboratory using 
appropriate diagnostic techniques.
 
a
 
If an apparently healthy dog or cat in or from a low
-
risk area is placed under observation, treatment 
may be delayed.
 
b
 
This observation period applies only to dogs and cats. 
Except for threatened or endangered species, 
other domestic and wild animals suspected of being rabid should be euthanized and their tissues 
examined for the presence of rabies antigen by appropriate laboratory techniques.
 
c
 
Bites especially on the head, n
eck, face, hands and genitals are category III exposures because of 
the rich innervation of these areas.

Post
-
exposure prophylaxis of previously non
-
immunised individuals
 
Vaccine should be administered on Day 0, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28 (5 injectio
ns of 1mL).
 
 
For category III exposure (see Table 1), rabies immunoglobulin should be given in association with vaccine. 
In this case, the vaccine should be administered contra
-
laterally, if possible.
 
 
Vaccination should not be discontinued unless the anim
al is declared not rabid according to a veterinarian 
assessment (supervision of animal and/or laboratory analysis). 
 
 
Post
-
exposure prophylaxis of previously immunised individuals
 
Previously immunised individuals should receive one dose of vaccine intramus
cularly on both days 0 and 3. 
Rabies immunoglobulin is not indicated in such 
cases.
 
 
Use in immunocompromised individuals
 

 
Pre
-
exposure prophylaxis
 
For immunocompromised individuals, serology testing of neutralising antibodies should be 
performed 2 to 4 wee
ks after the vaccination to assess the possible need for an additional dose of the 
vaccine.
 

 
Post
-
exposure prophylaxis
 
For immunocompromised individuals, only a full vaccination schedule should be administered. 
Rabies immunoglobulin should be given in assoc
iation with the vaccine for both categories II & III 
exposures (see Table 1).
 
 
How the vaccine is administered
 
 
The doctor or nurse will make up and shake the 
vaccine just before it is given, 
and will check that the liquid 
is a pinkish colour and that ther
e are no unexpected particles in it.
 
The vaccine is for intramuscular administration only. The vaccine should be administered into the deltoid 
muscle for adults and children or the anterolateral area of the thigh muscle in
 
infants and toddlers.
 
The 
vaccine
 
should not be given into
 
the
 
buttock
. 
 
If Rabies Immunoglobulin is also being given, then it will be injected at a different site to the vaccination 
site.
