It has only gotten worse with the managers though.
 Here’s a list of some of the stuff happening: -manager makes little comments about my body and my eating habits.
 -manager said certain ethnicities are more likely to steal.
 -manager made fun of an Indian mans accent.
 -manager coming into work despite not passing self assessment.
 There is so much to unpack here.
 I’m not even sure what to do at this point.
 It’s so unbelievably toxic.

 My sister has asked for a nice neutral, every day eyeshadow palette for Christmas.
 Would love to hear your thoughts and what you’d recommend!!
 She has light skin with olive undertones.
 one of them is constantly going after someone, and will make comments about their illnesses/how annoying it is if they call out despite it being a pandemic.
 ive been w the company on \u0026 off for 2.5 yrs and work my ass off and thats how I get thanked.
 but after 3 hours, I still didn't get the e-gift card and credit.
 They are still pretty good, but for the price I would like to extend them as long as I can.
 Another question.
 I placed my first order to bring my status up to Platinum, but I know there's a waiting period on points being awarded.
 However, if I place another order today, will I earn the 1.25 pts or just 1 pt per dollar?

 How many GWP’s can we add to an online order ?
 Not for BOPIS, but regular online shopping ??
 Is there a limit ?
 I know most GWP’s have a specific limit on how much you spend to get it.
 But what if you buy multiple products that each have a GWP ?
 And meet the criteria to add that GWP ?
 I've found this to be the case at most drugstore products at Ulta including makeup, shampoos, hair tools, everything.
 Even with the buy one get one 50% that they occasionally do (which they are not for OGX right now), or the 3.50 off coupons, the prices are often still more expensive or finally the same prices as other drugstores.
 The ingredients are always exactly the same so it's not like the cheaper stores are selling different products that are embellished in a well-known brands packaging.
 I obviously am aware that it's up to me to choose where I ultimately shop at but I've always been curious about product pricing markups and Ulta seems to be one of the biggest perpetuators.
 Can they do that?
 I couldn’t find if this was answered, but does anyone know if there’s going to be a 20% this year that’ll include Dyson?
 I’m Diamond if that helps.
 i’d been thinking about buying some chanel skincare for my mom for christmas - does anyone know if our discount works for chanel?
 i know it does for most stuff but since it’s such a pricey brand i wasn’t sure.

 I’ve applied to 5 seasonal positions at ulta locations yesterday (Nov 2nd) and was wondering how long it typically takes to hear back if I get an interview?
