GROWING GAP BETWEEN SENIORS IN NEED AND SENIORS SERVED
With 12,000 individuals turning 60 every day and a senior population 
increasingly threatened by hunger, the gap between those in need and 
those being served through the OAA continues to widen. OAA Nutrition 
Programs are serving 23 million fewer meals to seniors in need than in 
2005 while waiting lists are mounting in every state. This is due in large 

part to federal funding not keeping pace. Funding for OAA programs is 
provided through the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS-Education) annual 
appropriations bill, and dollars are allocated to states based on a formula. 
THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT
UNITED STATES
2017
For more than 50 years, 
THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT
 (OAA) has been the primary piece of federal legislation 

supporting social and 
nutrition services to Americans age 60 and 
older.
 OAA programs are vital for seniors who are at signi˜cant risk 
of hunger, isolation and losing their ability to live independently.
 Title III of the OAA establishes a grant system to fund programs 

that address the unique needs of vulnerable seniors.
These include services such as:
me-delivered meals and meals served in group 

     settings such as senior centers
ransportation 
n-home personal care and community supports

   Caregiver assistance

reventative health and wellness programs
mployment services and training
