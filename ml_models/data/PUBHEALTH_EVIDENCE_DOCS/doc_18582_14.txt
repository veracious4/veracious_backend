 This cross‐sectional study sought to characterize the association between age and semen quality, a well‐known proxy of fertility status.
 METHODS: A convenience sample of 97 non‐smoking men (aged 22–80 years) without known fertility problems was recruited from a national government laboratory.
 The men provided semen samples and information relating to lifestyle, diet, medical and occupational details.
 Semen volume (ml), sperm concentration (×106/ml), total sperm count (×106), motility (%), progressive motility (%) and total progressively motile sperm count (×106) were measured.
 There was a suggested decrease in sperm concentration and count.
 The proportion of men with abnormal volume, concentration and motility was significantly increased across the age decades.
 CONCLUSIONS: In a convenience sample of healthy men from a non‐clinical setting, semen volume and sperm motility decreased continuously between 22–80 years of age, with no evidence of a threshold.
 Key words: age/semen volume/sperm concentration/sperm motility/total sperm count Introduction Approximately 15% of couples of reproductive age experience infertility, and more than a quarter of infertility cases may be attributed to male factors (Templeton, 1995).
 It is well known that maternal age is a significant contributor to human infertility (Joffe and Li, 1994), due primarily to the precipitous loss of functional oocytes in women by their late thirties (Tietze, 1957; Lansac, 1995).
 Human spermatogenesis, on the other hand, continues well into advanced ages, allowing men to reproduce during senescence.
 Although very little is known about the topic, paternal age may also contribute to human infertility.Understanding the effect of male age on fertility has become increasingly important in public health because a growing number of men are choosing to father children at older ages (Ventura et al., 1997).
 In the United States, for example, there has been a 24% increase in the birth rate for fathers aged 35 to 54 years since 1980.
 However, advanced male age has been associated with significant reductions in pregnancy rates, increased time‐to‐pregnancy and increased subfecundity (Kidd et al., 2001).
 In a recent study of 8515 planned pregnancies (of greater than 24 weeks gestation), men older than 35 years had half the chance of fathering a child within 12 months compared with men aged less than 25 years, after controlling for women’s age and other factors (Ford et al., 2000).Semen quality is generally considered to be a proxy measure of male fertility, and changes in semen quality can occur after exposure to toxic agents (Wyrobek et al., 1983; Wyrobek, 1993) or from host factor effects such as age (Kidd et al., 2001).
 The weight of evidence primarily from clinical studies (see Kidd et al., 2001 for a review) suggests that age is associated with diminished semen volume, sperm motility and/or sperm morphology, but that sperm concentration is affected little by age (Schwartz et al., 1983; Wang et al., 1985; Abramsson, 1988; Carlsen et al., 1992; Berling and Wolner‐Hanssen, 1997; Lemcke et al., 1997; Spandorfer et al., 1998).
 However, it is unclear whether these observations are applicable to the general population of healthy men.
 Also, men at older ages (e.g.
 &gt;50 years) were under‐represented in many of these clinical studies, which limited statistical power and prevented the determination of the shape of the relationship between age and semen quality.
 In addition, potential confounders that might explain changes with age, such as smoking history or duration of abstinence, were seldom controlled.The purpose of the current research was to examine the magnitude and the shape of the relationships between age and semen volume, sperm concentration and sperm motility in a non‐clinical group of men selected to span across a wide range of age, from their 20s to their 80s.
 These men provided extensive information on medical, lifestyle and occupational exposure factors that could affect semen quality.
 Materials and methods Subjects The study population of the Age and Genetic Effects on Sperm (AGES) Study consisted of a convenience sample of 97 male volunteers employed or retired from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) located in Livermore, California.
 LLNL was used as the recruitment site because the workforce is relatively homogeneous and because it was the site of the semen analysis laboratory.
 The AGES Study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the participating institutions and all subjects gave written informed consent.Male workers and retirees were recruited between October 1997 and July 1998 from advertisements posted at the LLNL, e‐mail listings, and in newsletters.
 Preliminary screening over the telephone excluded men who had smoked cigarettes in the last 6 months; had a vasectomy or a history of an undescended testicle or prostate cancer; had ever received chemotherapy or radiation treatments; had current fertility or reproductive problems (men were included who claimed their wives had a fertility problem); or had a previous semen analysis with zero sperm count.
 At least 15 men were recruited from each age decade from age 20 to age 70 years; additional men above age 70 were also enrolled.Eligible men were mailed a questionnaire, a semen collection container, and a small foam‐insulated vacuum container (Aladdin Industries Inc., Nashville, TN, USA).
 The men were instructed to provide a semen sample by masturbation into the collection container after abstaining from ejaculating for 2–7 days, and to deliver it inside the insulated container to a drop box at LLNL.
 The questionnaire gathered information on medical history, reproductive history (e.g.
 fatherhood history), sociodemographic characteristics (age, race, education) and lifestyle habits (e.g.
 diet, alcohol, cigarette and caffeine consumption).
 Completed questionnaires were mailed to the University of California at Berkeley.
 The completed questionnaires were reviewed with the participant over the telephone.
 Semen analysis All semen samples were delivered within 2 h of collection.
 One laboratory technician performed all the analyses, and was blinded to the age and identity of the donors.
 Semen analysis was performed immediately upon receipt of the sample, averaging about 45 min after its production (range 5–120 min).
 Duplicate samples were requested from donors if the sample exhibited any of the following: volume 10% difference was found between the two analyses of the same sample, the sample was re‐analysed.
 All cell counting was performed on a Macintosh computer using a modified version of CytoScore© developed at LLNL.
 Statistical analysis All analyses were conducted using STATA 7.0 (Stata Statistical Software, 1999).
 Total sperm count was calculated by multiplying semen volume by sperm concentration.
 Total progressively motile sperm was defined as the product of total sperm count and percent progressive motility.
 Volume and motility appeared to be normally distributed, while sperm progressive motility, concentration, total count, and total progressively motile sperm were log‐transformed to achieve normality.
 Zero values for semen parameters were re‐coded to half of the lowest measured value before transformation.
 All count and concentration analyses were performed with and without four subjects with azoospermia; all motility analyses were performed without these men.Separate multiple linear regression models were used to examine the relationship of age with each semen parameter controlling for the following potential confounding factors: duration of abstinence; average ejaculation frequency (last 3 months); time from sample collection to sample processing; season; time worked at LLNL; body mass index; ethnicity; years of education; potential occupational exposures (last 3 months); dosimetry records; time spent sitting; medication use; alcohol and caffeine intake; history of tobacco use; history of chronic disease (e.g.
 high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes); history of genitourinary disease (e.g.
 urinary tract or other genitourinary infection, sexually transmitted disease or past history of infertility); and fatherhood history.
 Both percent motile and percent progressively motile sperm were lower in men who had ever had a urinary tract infection.
 Total number of progressively motile sperm was lower in men who had ever had high blood pressure.
 This number is converted from the antilog of the regression coefficient (β) of the log‐linear model [(antilog(β) – 1)×100].
