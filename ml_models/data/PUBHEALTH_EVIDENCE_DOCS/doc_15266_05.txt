The disparity in asthma mortality between black and white children has increased in recent years. The national picture of childhood asthma A major frustration in fighting asthma is the mystery of its development. It remains unknown why some people get the disease and others do not. Research has identified several factors associated with the development of asthma, but none have proven to be the causative agent. Asthma is characterized by episodes or attacks of inflammation and narrowing of small airways. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest pain or tightness, and are triggered by a variety of things such as allergens (e.g., pollen, dust mites, animal dander, etc.), infections, exercise, changes in the weather, and exposure to airway irritants (e.g., tobacco smoke). Some people have mild asthma; others have severe and life-threatening attacks; and some people may have attacks ranging from mild to severe (4). People develop asthma at different stages of their lives, and many subsequently cease to have any symptoms (5). Most likely, the disease known as asthma is a spectrum of conditions, and likewise, the causes of asthma are a complex interaction of different factors. A constellation of causes is likely to gradually emerge. Asthma is a priority for the research, medical, environmental, and public health communities because: +Asthma is one of the leading chronic childhood diseases in the United States (6) and a major cause of childhood disability (7). +Asthma places a huge burden on affected children and their families: asthma may limit a child™s ability to play, learn, and sleep; necessitates potentially complex and expensive interventions (8); and results in both direct medical costs and indirect costs (e.g., missed school days and work days). +Childhood asthma prevalence more than doubled from 1980 to the mid-1990s (9;10) and remains at historically high levels. The factors driving this pattern are still not fully understood. +The causes of asthma remain unclear and current research paints a complex picture (5). +Although there are means to prevent attacks or exacerbations among children with asthma (1), the majority of children with asthma still suffer from attacks (11). +The burden of avoidable emergency department visits and hospitalizations for asthma is high and has remained relatively resistant to intervention efforts (9,11). +Evidence of the impact of the environment on asthma incidence and morbidityŠespecially allergens and irritants such as cigarette smoke and outdoor pollutantsŠhas been mounting (12). This brief report presents overall trends in childhood asthma over the past two decades and examines the burden of asthma through each stage of childhood and among children of different race and ethnic groups. While data for prevalence, health care use, and mortality are major indicators of the impact of asthma on children, asthma symptoms that are unrecognized or not severe enough to warrant emergency care or hospitalization can still lower quality of life. Part of recent efforts to address the burden of asthma involves developing methods to track symptoms and disease management. When available, these new sources of data will provide greater insight into the burden of asthma and the impact of intervention efforts.  3 Advance Data No. 381 + December 12, 2006 Asthma prevalence rates among children remain at historically high levels following dramatic increases from 1980 until the late 1990s Currently, there are no national measures of asthma incidence, or the rate at which people develop asthma over a period of time. Instead, we focus on asthma prevalence, the percentage of the population that has asthma at a given point in time, and thus face the risk of suffering symptoms and adverse effects of the disease. Prevalence is important as it identifies the population in need of effective measures to control asthma symptoms. Figure 2 shows the trend in asthma prevalence since 1980. The major tracking system for asthma prevalence is the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which is used to produce annual health estimates based on self report of a nationally representative sample. From 1980 to 1996, the NHIS measured asthma period prevalence, that is, the percentage of people with asthma in the past 12 months. In 1997, the NHIS questionnaire was redesigned. Starting in 1997, asthma prevalence estimates are based on receiving an asthma diagnosis, currently having the disease at the time of the interview, and experiencing an attack in the past year. The new measure that is most similar to the previous measure of asthma period prevalence is current asthma prevalenceŠthe percentage of children with asthma at the time of the health interview. An analysis of NHIS data before and after the 1997 redesign indicates that if the redesign had not been undertaken, the period prevalence measurements would show a plateau in the late 1990s (13). That is, most of the apparent jump between the 1996 asthma period prevalence estimate from the old NHIS and the 2001 current asthma prevalence estimate is likely attributable to the change in the NHIS questionnaire, and not a substantial change in prevalence.

Because current asthma prevalence estimates are higher than pre-1997 asthma period prevalence estimates, it may be tempting to conclude that asthma prevalence continued to increase after 1996. However, the difference between asthma period prevalence estimates and current asthma prevalence estimates is likely due to NHIS questionnaire changes (13). Nonetheless, prevalence remains at historically high levels. In 2005, 8.9% of children currently had asthma (6.5 million children). +Asthma attack prevalence measures the percentage of children who had at least one attack over the past 12 months. It is a crude estimate of the percentage of symptomatic children who may have poorly controlled asthma, and thus are at risk of adverse outcomes such as emergency department visits or hospitalization. In 2005, 5.2% of children had at least one asthma attack in the previous year (3.8 million children). Nearly two of every three children who currently have asthma had at least one attack in the past 12 months. +Lifetime asthma diagnosis measures the percentage of children who have ever received a diagnosis of asthma. It is a more general measure of the impact of asthma among children. Many of these children do not currently have asthma. In 2005, 12.7% of children had been diagnosed with asthma at some point in their lifetime (9 million children), of whom 70% were reported to currently have asthma (6.5 million). +Measures of asthma morbidity and control are available periodically from the NHIS. In 2003: Œ Children with at least one asthma attack (4 million) in the previous year missed an estimated 12.8 million school days due to asthma. Œ Among children with asthma, 39% reported receiving an asthma management plan from their health care provider, 57% reported being taught how to monitor peak flow, and 52% reported being advised to change things at home or in school to improve asthma management.  4 Advance Data No. 381 + December 12, 2006 Despite the plateau in asthma prevalence, ambulatory care use has continued to grow since 2000 Increasing rates of visits to physician offices and hospital outpatient departments for asthma may indicate increasing prevalence or severity, or reflect progress in addressing the burden of asthma. Clinical practice guidelines from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (1) recommend that asthma symptoms be treated early and aggressively. These guidelines also recommend that patients be evaluated for asthma severity, initial treatment be tailored to severity level, and close monitoring of symptoms and adjustment of therapy be continued over time. Poor asthma outcomes such as hospitalizations and deaths are at least partially sensitive to the quality of ambulatory health care (14). An appropriate frequency of outpatient visits is one component of quality ambulatory care. Managing asthma involves close monitoring by health care professionals both when asthma symptoms flare and when the disease is quiescent. Thus, trends in visits for asthma in outpatient settings reflect a spectrum of reasons for making visits to the doctor for asthma (Figure 3). Visits to physician offices are measured by the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), administered in 1980Œ1981, 1985, and continuously since 1989. In 1992, the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) began to provide data on visits to hospital outpatient departments. Information is obtained on visit events rather than the number of people who went to see physicians.

Number of ambulatory visits for asthma per 1,000 children 0Œ17 years of age, by site, United States, 1980Œ2004 +The periodic data available from 1980 to 1990 show a relatively stable rate of visits for asthma to physician offices. Since the early 1990s, there has been an increase in visit rates. The temporary increase in 1998 appears to be due to random variation. +The majority of nonurgent ambulatory visits for asthma occur in physician offices. In 2004, there were 89 visits to physician offices per 1,000 children (6.5 million visits) and 6 per 1,000 children (0.5 million visits) to hospital outpatient departments, a total of 95 visits per 1,000 children, or 7 million ambulatory visits for asthma. Just over 2.5% of all ambulatory visits among children 0Œ17 years of age made in 2004 were for asthma. +Ambulatory care use has continued to increase after 2000 despite a plateau in prevalence trends. Factors driving this upward trend may include increasing disease severity, and increased health care use to improve asthma control due to increased public and provider awareness. Increased ambulatory care use for asthma has continued during an era when overall rate of ambulatory care use for children did not increase (15).  5 Advance Data No. 381 + December 12, 2006 Since 1992, when data first became available, the rate of 140 emergency department visits 120 for asthma has remained relatively stable 100 Asthma attacks or exacerbations are frequently managed in emergency departments (EDs). Having an asthma attack that warrants a visit to the ED may be a sign of severe asthma or Visits per 10,000 80 60 40 uncontrolled disease, inadequate access to specialist health care, or inappropriate use of emergency services (16,17). Recurrent ED visits and hospitalizations are risk factors for fatal asthma attacks (18). In theory, asthma symptoms and poor outcomes are avoidable with implementation of environmental control measures to minimize exposure to allergens and irritants, appropriate medication use, and patient and health care provider education (1). However, recognizing the early signs and symptoms of the disease, avoiding asthma triggers, arranging appropriate health care, and managing the schedule of medication administration can be complex for children and their families. Indeed, evidence shows that children who visit the ED for asthma continue to suffer from symptoms and activity limitations despite having the health encounter in the ED (19). Trends in ED visits (Figure 4) are a crude indicator of the burden of severe and uncontrolled disease on families and the health care system, the impact of public health interventions, the degree of uptake of asthma guidelines in disease management, and the successful translation of research into medical practice. Data on ED visits are collected by the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), administered since 1992. Information is available for visit events rather than the number of people who visited EDs. 20 0 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 SOURCE: CDC/NCHS, National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.

It also represents significant costs to the health care system and to affected families. Risks for hospitalization for asthma include previous asthma 20 10 admissions, previous intubation for asthma, and severe symptoms (20). In theory, hospitalizations for asthma should be largely preventable if patients and their families are adequately educated about the disease and have access to high quality health care (14). Although some hospitalizations may not be avoidable, especially in very young children suffering from respiratory infections, trends in hospitalization over time (Figure 5) can help determine if intervention and management strategies are having an impact on the burden of disease. The National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) collects information on hospitalizations. The NHDS counts events (hospitalizations) rather than the number of people who are admitted to hospitals. Although some of the hospitalizations for asthma may be re-admissions, research suggests that re-admissions are not driving the overall pattern for asthma (21). 0 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 SOURCE: CDC/NCHS, National Hospital Discharge Survey. Figure 5. Number of hospitalizations for asthma per 10,000 children 0Œ17 years of age, United States, 1980Œ2004 +From 1980 through the mid-1990s, asthma hospitalization rates increased for children 0Œ17 years of age. This pattern follows that for prevalence, although there is evidence that improved diagnosis of asthma also contributed to the increase in hospitalizations attributed to asthma (9). Since the late 1990s, it appears that the asthma hospitalization rate among children plateaued at historically high levels. +In 2004, there were 27 hospitalizations for asthma per 10,000 children for a total of 198,000 hospitalizations. Asthma hospitalizations represented about 3% of all hospitalizations among children. +Many factors drive hospitalization rates among children. Overall hospitalization use among children has decreased over the time period when asthma hospitalization rates remained level (22). The threshold of attack severity for a hospital admission has likely increased. That is, asthma hospitalizations in recent years may represent more severe exacerbations compared with earlier years.  7 Advance Data No. 381 + December 12, 2006 Asthma death rates appear to have declined recently 5 following a rising trend from 1980 through the mid-1990s 4 Asthma deaths among children are Deaths per 1,000,000rare but potentially avoidable. Children most at risk of dying from asthma are those with severe, uncontrolled disease, a near-fatal attack of asthma, a history of recurrent hospitalization or intubation 3 2 ICD Revision 19991 for asthma (18). Trends in asthma 1 deaths (Figure 6) are a stark indicator of how well the disease is diagnosed and controlled. Information on deaths occurring in the U.S. is collected by the Mortality Component of the National Vital Statistics System. The National Center for Health Statistics compiles information abstracted by each state from death records. The impact of asthma varies through the stages of childhood; prevalence increases with age, but health care use is highest among the youngest children The profile of asthma changes as children get older, as shown in Table A. In general, when asthma burden is examined over the stages of childhood, trends in levels of health care with age are inversely related to trends in prevalence rates. Understanding the characteristics of asthma in each stage of childhood helps to explain this pattern. Wheezing is common among infants and toddlers because their small airways are more susceptible to any mechanism that impedes airflow, and they have a high incidence of respiratory infections. Definitively diagnosing asthma in infants and toddlers can be difficult given the many etiologies that cause wheezing in very young children. Furthermore, young children who wheeze only during respiratory infections are likely to have transient symptoms (5,23Œ25). This pattern may make clinicians reluctant to label wheezing as a chronic disease among young children. However, respiratory distress in young children can rapidly become life threatening and warrants prompt attention. For this reason, 0 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2004 1 Beginning with data year 1999, cause-of-death statistics published by NCHS are classified according to ˜the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). ˜SOURCE: CDC/NCHS, Mortality Component of the National Vital Statistics System.˜Figure 6.

Among school-age children, allergies/atopic sensitization starts to become a more prominent cause of wheezing, and displaces respiratory infections as a main trigger of attacks (5,24). The emergence of more clearly identifiable and predictable symptoms in school-age children allows easier identification and management of asthma compared with younger children. Families, health care professionals, and schools who work well together can successfully control symptoms. However, families coping with other factors that can interfere with good asthma management may be less successful. Adolescents with asthma need to learn to recognize and treat symptoms independently. Issues with emerging autonomy may accentuate good management strategies, or exacerbate problems with asthma control. The relatively low level of health care use for asthma among adolescents may indicate a combination of patterns among this group: changes in disease severity, higher success in controlling a chronic disease, or lack of medical attention and poor use of medication to relieve symptoms. Of particular concern for adolescents is the higher rate of asthma deaths in this group compared with younger children. The pattern over childhood differs for boys and girls. Boys experience a higher current asthma prevalence rate throughout most of childhood. By ages 15Œ17 years, however, the current prevalence rate in girls, 10.5%, has surpassed that among boys, 10.1%. Higher prevalence among females persists among adults. Use of ambulatory and hospital health care services through age 10 years is higher among boys. During adolescence, however, ambulatory care use is greater among 11Œ17 year old girls compared with boys. Hospitalization rates among adolescent boys, however, remain slightly higher. Asthma death rates among boys remain higher throughout childhood. Death rates rise between school-age and adolescent groups among both genders. 11-17 years 5-10 years 0-4 years Deaths 2003-2004 Hospitalizations 2003-2004 Emergency department visits 2003-2004 Current prevalence 2004-2005 0% 100% 200% Proportional impact relative to all children ages 0-17 years SOURCES: CDC/NCHS, National Health Interview Survey, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, ˜National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the Mortality Component of the National Vital Statistic System.˜Figure 7.

The 100 percent level represents the overall rate for children 0Œ17 years for each measure, and is shown by the vertical line. Each bar on the chart represents the proportional impact of each outcome for each age group relative to the total for all children ages 0Œ17 years (e.g., the proportional impact of current asthma prevalence rates among children 0Œ4 years is 6.2% over the total prevalence for all children, 8.7%, for a proportional impact of 71%). Children 0Œ4 years have the lowest proportional impact of prevalence. However, the proportional impact of ED visit and hospitalization rates for asthma among the youngest children overshadows that among older age groups. Unlike younger children, the proportional impact of mortality from asthma among adolescents is higher than that for health care use. Racial disparities in childhood asthma are extensive; black and Puerto Rican children have high prevalence rates, and black children have dramatically higher mortality rates compared with white children The higher rates of asthma prevalence, ED visits, hospitalizations and deaths among minority children have been well documented (9,26Œ 28). Racial disparities remained evident in asthma prevalence through 2005 (Table B). Children of American Indian or Alaska Native decent have current asthma prevalence rates 25% higher and black children 60% higher than white children. Asian children have the lowest prevalence rates. When race and ethnicity are considered, Puerto Rican children have the highest prevalence of all groups, 140% higher than non-Hispanic white children, whereas Mexican children have low reported rates. In light of these differing prevalence rates, the lower rate for ambulatory care visits among black children compared with white children suggests that black children may be underutilizing ambulatory care.

The racial disparities in these adverse asthma outcomes are much greater than those in asthma prevalence. Compared with white children, black children have a 260% higher ED visit rate, a 250% higher hospitalization rate, and a 500% higher death rate from asthma. Unfortunately, information about race/ethnicity and income are not consistently available across the health care data systems used to measure the impact of asthma.

Ratio of black to white asthma death rates, children 0Œ17 years, United States, 1999Œ2004 Figures 9a and 9b present recent trends in asthma death rates for black children and white children. Although overall asthma death rates have declined since 1999 (Figure 9a), this pattern is not observed for black children among whom death rates remained relatively level. As a result, the black and white disparity for asthma deaths has increased since 1999 as measured by the ratio of the black rate to the white rate (Figure 9b). The lack of progress among black children in lowering mortality from asthma may reflect a number of factors such as more severe disease, greater environmental obstacles (e.g., residence in more polluted or high poverty areas), lag in uptake of medical advances to control asthma symptoms among health care providers who treat black children, and lack of asthma education or difficulties in adopting certain asthma control methods by black families. Summary The large increases in the burden of childhood asthma seen in the 1980s until the late 1990s appear to have abated in recent years. Yet, the burden remains at the highest levels recorded for all measures except mortality. The decrease in asthma death rates among children since 1999 is encouraging, and may signal the accomplishments of the many diverse groups working to lighten the burden of asthma. However, asthma deaths are theoretically preventable, and black children have not experienced a decrease in asthma mortality. Furthermore, the measures presented in this report reveal only part of the burden of asthma for children and their families, especially because the measures used rely on a physician accurately diagnosing asthma and either relaying this information to the child™s family (prevalence measures) or documenting the condition in medical records (health care use). The most current data show that the challenges of childhood asthma remain and that asthma persists as a significant public health problem.  11 Advance Data No. 381 + December 12, 2006 References 1.˚National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.

Asthma and wheezing in  12 Advance Data No. 381 + December 12, 2006 Technical Notes Asthma prevalence data Prevalence data were obtained from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a cross-sectional household interview survey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. Excluded are patients in long-term care facilities, Armed Forces active duty personnel (although dependents are included), and U.S. nationals living in foreign countries. NHIS interviewing is continuous throughout each year, and follows a multistage area probability design that permits the representative sampling of households. From each family in the NHIS, one sample adult and, for families with children under 18 years of age, one sample child are randomly selected to participate in the detailed health survey. A responsible adult, usually a parent, reports in proxy for the sample child. NHIS obtains information on illnesses, injuries, activity limitation, chronic conditions, health insurance coverage, utilization of health care, other health topics, demographic information, and risk factor data. Special modules and supplements focus on different issues each year. Additional questions about asthma were most recently included in the 2002 and 2003 NHIS. NHIS has been conducted annually since 1957. In 1997, the questionnaire was redesigned and some basic concepts were changed and other concepts were measured in different ways. Also in 1997, the collection methodology changed from paper and pencil questionnaires to computer-assisted personal interviewing. Since 1997, the annual sample has numbered about 100,000 persons with about 30,000 persons participating in the sample adult and about 15,000 persons in the sample child questionnaires. In recent years, the total household response rate was about 90%. National estimates from NHIS are produced by using the sample weights. Because the sample weights incorporate U.S. Census estimates of the civilian noninstitutionalized population, no denominators are necessary to compute percentages. For More Information: See the NHIS website at: http://www.cdc.gov/ nchs/nhis.htm. Physician office visit data Data on asthma visits to physician offices are obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), a national survey designed to provide information about the provision and use of medical care services in office-based physician practices in the U.S. The survey covers patient encounters in the offices of nonfederally employed physicians classified by the American Medical Association or American Osteopathic Association as ‚‚office-based, patient care™™ physicians. Excluded are visits to hospital-based physicians, visits to specialists in anesthesiology, pathology, and radiology, and visits to physicians who are principally engaged in teaching, research, or administration. Telephone contacts and nonoffice visits are also excluded. A multistage probability design is employed. The final stage involves systematic random samples of office visits during randomly assigned 7-day reporting periods. In 1985 the survey excluded Alaska and Hawaii. Data are collected from medical records on type of providers seen; reason for visit; diagnoses; drugs ordered, provided, or continued; and selected procedures and tests ordered or performed during the visit. Patient data include age, sex, race, and expected source of payment. The NAMCS, which began in 1973, was conducted annually until 1981, again in 1985, and resumed an annual schedule in 1989. In 2004, 1,961 physicians were in scope and 1,372 participated for a response rate of 65%. Data were provided for 25,286 visits. National estimates of the number of asthma visits were calculated using survey weights. To obtain visit rates for a group, national estimates of the number of visits were divided by the civilian noninstitutionalized population for that group (see section on population estimates). For More Information: See the Ambulatory Health Care Data website at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ about/major/ahcd/ahcd1.htm. Hospital outpatient and emergency department visit data Visit data to hospital outpatient departments (OPDs) and emergency departments (EDs) were obtained from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) that collects data on the utilization and provision of medical care services provided in hospital OPDs and EDs. The survey is a representative sample of visits to EDs and OPDs of nonfederal, short-stay, or general hospitals. Telephone contacts are excluded. In the NHAMCS OPD survey, a clinic is defined as an administrative unit of the OPD in which ambulatory medical care is provided under the supervision of a physician. If a hospital OPD has five or fewer in-scope clinics, all are included in the sample. For hospital OPDs with more than five clinics, a systematic sample of clinics proportional to size is included in the survey. Visits to eligible EDs and OPDs are systematically sampled over the 4-week reporting period such that about 100 ED encounters and about 200 OPD encounters are selected. Data are collected from medical records on type of providers seen; reason for visit; diagnoses; drugs ordered, provided, or continued; and selected procedures and tests performed during the visit. Patient data include age, sex, race, and expected source of payment. Annual data collection began in 1992. In any given year, the hospital sample consists of approximately 500 hospitals, of which 80 percent have EDs and about half have eligible OPDs. Typically, about 1,000 clinics are selected from participating hospital OPDs. In 2004, the hospital response rate was 89% for EDs and 75% for OPDs. Sample data are weighted to produce national estimates. To obtain visit rates for a group, national estimates of number of visits were divided by the  13 Advance Data No. 381 + December 12, 2006 civilian population for that group (see section on population estimates). For More Information: See the Ambulatory Health Care website at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/ ahcd/ahcd1.htm. Hospital discharge visit data Data on asthma hospital discharges were obtained from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) that collects and produces national estimates on characteristics of inpatient stays in nonfederal short-stay hospitals in the U.S. Included in the survey are hospitals with an average length of stay of less than 30 days for all inpatients, general hospitals, and children™s general hospitals. Excluded are federal, military, and Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals, as well as hospital units of institutions (such as prison hospitals), and hospitals with fewer than six beds staffed for patient use. Two data collection procedures are used in the survey. One is a manual system of sample selection and medical transcription from the hospital records to abstract forms. The second is an automated system in which the National Center for Health Statistics purchases machine-readable medical record data from commercial organizations, state data systems, hospitals, or hospital associations. Patient information collected includes demographics, length of stay, diagnoses, and procedures. Hospital characteristics collected include geographic region of the country, ownership, and bed size. The NHDS has been conducted annually since 1965. Hospitals are selected using a modified three-stage stratified design. For 2004, the sample consisted of 501 hospitals, of which 439 responded. Data were collected for approximately 371,000 discharges. Sample data are weighted to produce national estimates. To obtain hospitalization rates for a group, national estimates of hospitalizations were divided by the civilian population of that group (see section on population estimates). For More Information: See the National Health Care Survey website at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs.nhcs.htm. Mortality data Data on deaths are obtained from the Mortality Component of the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) that collects and publishes official national statistics on births, deaths, and fetal deaths based on U.S. Standard Certificates. Vital events occurring in the U.S. to non-U.S. residents and vital events occurring abroad to U.S. residents are excluded. By law, the registration of deaths is the responsibility of the funeral director. The funeral director obtains demographic data for the death certificate from an informant. The physician in attendance at the death is required to certify the cause of death. The mortality file includes demographic information on age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, state of residence, and educational attainment, and medical information on cause of death. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), by which cause of death is coded and classified, is revised approximately every 10 to 15 years. Beginning with data year 1999, the cause-of-death statistics are classified according to the Tenth Revision of the ICD (ICD-10). Discontinuities between the Ninth and Tenth Revisions for selected causes of death are measured using comparability ratios. For asthma, the comparability ratio for the overall population in 1999 was 0.89. That is, the overall number of deaths attributed to asthma was 11% lower using ICD-10 compared with ICD-9. Data obtained from the mortality file represent a complete count of deaths. To obtain asthma death rates for a group, the number of deaths was divided by the residential population of that group (see section on population estimates). For More Information: See the Mortality Data website at: http:// www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/dvs/ mortdata.htm. Population estimates The census of population (decennial census) has been held in the United States every 10 years since 1790. Data on sex, race, age, and marital status are collected from 100% of the enumerated population. Postcensal population estimates are estimates made for the years following a census before the next census has been taken, and are derived by updating counts in the decennial census using a ‚‚components of population change™™ approach (accounting for births, deaths, net international migration and net movement of U.S Armed Forces and U.S. civilians). Postcensal population estimates were used to calculate ambulatory visit rates, hospitalization rates and death rates for the years 2001Œ2004. With the completion of the decennial census at the end of the decade, intercensal estimates for the preceding decade were prepared to replace the less accurate postcensal estimates. Intercensal population estimates take into account the census of population at the beginning and end of the decade. Intercensal population estimates were used to calculate ambulatory visit rates, hospitalization rates and death rates for the years 1980Œ1999. A different data source was used to provide denominators to calculate death rates for Puerto Rican and Mexican children for the period 2003Œ2004. Population estimates for 0Œ17 year old children by Hispanic subgroup are not available. However, the Current Population Survey (CPS) website at: http://www.census.gov/population/www/ socdemo/hispanic.html collects information on Hispanic subgroup, and so CPS population estimates were used to calculate death rates for Puerto Rican and Mexican children. Because CPS estimates are based on survey data, they are subject to sampling error. In addition, studies have shown that persons self-reported as Hispanic on census and survey records may sometimes be reported as white or non-Hispanic on the death certificate, resulting in an underestimation of deaths and death rates for Hispanic groups. The overall impact of these errors on asthma death rates for Puerto Rican and Mexican children is unknown.  14 Advance Data No. 381 + December 12, 2006 Table I.
