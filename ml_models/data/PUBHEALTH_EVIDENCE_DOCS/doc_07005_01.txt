 "We're not trying to point fingers at who did it -- we just want answers," Anderson said.
 "We know back in the day this happened -- we just want to know why residents weren't notified.
 "Heavily contaminatedContamination at the Butterworth landfill site is no secret.
 The city of Grand Rapids operated the unlined dump for years, using three different sections from 1950 to 1973.
 The landfill areas are bordered by Wealthy Street SW, the Grand River and I-196.From 1950 to 1967, Butterworth #1 was an open dump where trash was often burned to reduce its volume,according to EPA documents.
 Butterworth #2 and #3 were eventually combined in to an 80-acre site that accepted both trash and industrial waste, possibly including liquid solvents and paint sludges that were directly dumped or disposed of in drums until 1973, according to EPA documents.The state closed the landfills in 1973 due to improper operations, and the EPA began its investigation of the site in 1986.
 The worst contaminants in the landfill include antimony, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, 1,1-dichloroethane, vinyl chloride, polychlorinated biphenols and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, according to the EPA.Cleanup started in 1999 and ended in 2000.
 It included removing 1,100 tons of PCB- and chromium-contaminated material and placing a clay cap on the landfill.
 The cap is considered to be "protective" enough to keep people from touching the contaminated soils or buried waste.
 "There is no current exposure to the waste at the site," the EPA said.A diagram of the Butterworth landfill in Grand Rapids, which is classified as a Superfund site by the U.S. EPA due to heavy contamination.
 The site was owned and operated by the city of Grand Rapids from 1950 to 1973, and remains owned by the city.
 It has since been capped.
 (Courtesy | U.S. EPA)'Theoretical cancer risks'The EPA estimates there are theoretical cancer and health risks from the landfill, but those are limited to regular direct contact with the waste over several decades and ingestion of contaminated drinking water -- which shouldn't happen because nearby homes are on the city's Lake Michigan-sourced water supply.
 "A lot of those kids in the '60s and '70s used to play in the dump," said Shane Smith, 36, who grew up down the street from Anderson.
 "It was just starting to alarm to us, because my dad's entire generation passed away from cancer.
 "The EPA said investigators did not collect soil samples and other data from the neighborhood around the landfill, but said that it "appears that the investigation did not conclude that these areas were at risk from the identified contamination at the site.
 ""Area groundwater moves from north to south towards the Grand River, away from these neighborhoods so any site impacts have been monitored in this direction," EPA said.Anderson said she is having the soil tested from a home on Indiana Avenue to see if there are contaminants.The 'Indiana gang'After a friend in the "Indiana gang" was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, Anderson started counting how many family members and former neighbors also had died from cancer.The deaths quickly started to add up, and Anderson started a Facebook group, "Westside Cancer Crisis."
 It has grown from 15 members to more than 250 people in the span of a month.
 Anderson estimated 75 percent of them have had a loved one die prematurely.Anderson and her mother moved to a house on Indiana Avenue in 1974 when she was 13.
 Anderson lived there for the next 20 years.
 Her mother was diagnosed with uterine and cervical cancer in 1993, and died a year later at the age of 54.Anderson, 56, now lives in Muskegon and said she has her own health issues: thyroid problems, leg edema and a history of miscarriages.After a rainy day, Anderson remembers smelling the trash in the dump -- and playing in a mud puddle that formed at the end of Indiana at Wealthy Street.Smith, who grew up on Indiana, said his father, uncle and great-uncle all lived on that street and died from pancreatic cancer.
 He said his grandmother died of lung cancer and cousin died of leukemia.
 "Our hope is maybe to try to figure out why are so many people getting diagnosed in such a small area with cancer," Smith said.A group of Indiana Avenue neighbors are planning to confront the Grand Rapids city commission Tuesday, June 5, about the matter.
 'No easy linkage'Members of the group have met with Kent County Health Department epidemiologist Brian Hartl on their findings so far.
 Hartl told them they needed to collect more information on the rates of cancer in their block before he could advise them on what they've found.
 "If there are rare forms of cancer, or cancers we're seeing affect a young population, it might trigger further investigation," Hartl said.Hartl added a word of caution, noting cancer is difficult to study.
 "Especially in small areas like a neighborhood or a block, it makes it challenging to connect it to environmental exposure," Hartl said.
 "Most cancers are due to lifestyle choices, not environmental factors.
 "Not only is cancer fairly common, it also can take years and multiple triggers to emerge, Hartl said.
 "The disconnect between science and human emotion -- that's what makes it challenging," Hartl said.
 "Cancer has a long latency period.
 A lot of times it takes 10 years before that exposure causes your cells to go awry.
 Within that, there's environmental exposures, there's lifestyle exposures.
 There's no easy linkage there -- I think that plays into it.
 It's not one exposure, one disease.
