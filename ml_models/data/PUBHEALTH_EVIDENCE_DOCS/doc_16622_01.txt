 3  plan and classify it as "suitable" or "unsuitable." The
 4  commission may suggest alternatives to the plan. All findings
 5  of the commission shall be made available to the Department of
 6  Environmental Protection for its consideration at any
 7  subsequent electrical power plant site certification
 8  proceedings. It is recognized that 10-year site plans
 9  submitted by an electric utility are tentative information for
10  planning purposes only and may be amended at any time at the
11  discretion of the utility upon written notification to the
12  commission. A complete application for certification of an
13  electrical power plant site under chapter 403, when such site
14  is not designated in the current 10-year site plan of the
15  applicant, shall constitute an amendment to the 10-year site
16  plan. In its preliminary study of each 10-year site plan, the
17  commission shall consider such plan as a planning document and
18  shall review:
19         (a)  The need, including the need as determined by the
20  commission, for electrical power in the area to be served.
21        (b)  The effect on fuel diversity within the state.22        (c)(b)  The anticipated environmental impact of each23  proposed electrical power plant site.24        (d)(c)  Possible alternatives to the proposed plan.25        (e)(d)  The views of appropriate local, state, and26  federal agencies, including the views of the appropriate water27  management district as to the availability of water and its
28  recommendation as to the use by the proposed plant of salt
29  water or fresh water for cooling purposes.
30        (f)(e)  The extent to which the plan is consistent with31  the state comprehensive plan.                                  41

 5         366.04  Jurisdiction of commission.--
 6         (6)  The commission shall further have exclusive
 7  jurisdiction to prescribe and enforce safety standards for
 8  transmission and distribution facilities of all public
 9  electric utilities, cooperatives organized under the Rural
10  Electric Cooperative Law, and electric utilities owned and
11  operated by municipalities. In adopting safety standards, the
12  commission shall, at a minimum:13         (a)  Adopt the 1984 edition of the National Electrical14  Safety Code (ANSI C2) as initial standards; and
15         (b)  Adopt, after review, any new edition of the
16  National Electrical Safety Code (ANSI C2).
17  
18  The standards prescribed by the current 1984 edition of the
19  National Electrical Safety Code (ANSI C2) shall constitute
20  acceptable and adequate requirements for the protection of the
21  safety of the public, and compliance with the minimum
22  requirements of that code shall constitute good engineering
23  practice by the utilities. The administrative authority
24  referred to in the 1984 edition of the National Electrical
25  Safety Code is the commission. However, nothing herein shall
26  be construed as superseding, repealing, or amending the
27  provisions of s. 403.523(1) and (10).

 3  rates and charges, classifications, standards of quality and
 4  measurements, including the ability to adopt construction 5  standards that exceed the National Electrical Safety Code, for 6  purposes of ensuring the reliable provision of service and 7  service rules and regulations to be observed by each public 8  utility; to require repairs, improvements, additions,
 9  replacements, and extensions to the plant and equipment of any10  public utility when reasonably necessary to promote the11  convenience and welfare of the public and secure adequate
12  service or facilities for those reasonably entitled thereto;
13  to employ and fix the compensation for such examiners and

17  enforce the provisions of this chapter.
18         (8)  If the commission determines that there is
19  probable cause to believe that inadequacies exist with respect
20  to the energy grids developed by the electric utility
21  industry, including inadequacies in fuel diversity or fuel22  supply reliability, it shall have the power, after proceedings23  as provided by law, and after a finding that mutual benefits24  will accrue to the electric utilities involved, to require
25  installation or repair of necessary facilities, including
26  generating plants and transmission facilities, with the costs
27  to be distributed in proportion to the benefits received, and
28  to take all necessary steps to ensure compliance. The electric
29  utilities involved in any action taken or orders issued

 9         403.521  Legislative intent.--The legislative intent of
10  this act is to establish a centralized and coordinated
11  licensing permitting process for the location of electric12  transmission line corridors and the construction, operation,13  and maintenance of electric transmission lines, which are14  critical infrastructure facilities. This necessarily involves15  several broad interests of the public addressed through the16  subject matter jurisdiction of several agencies. The
17  Legislature recognizes that electric transmission lines will18  have an effect upon the reliability of the electric power19  system, the environment, land use, and the welfare of the20  population. Recognizing the need to ensure electric power21  system reliability and integrity, and in order to meet
22  electric electrical energy needs in an orderly and timely23  fashion, the centralized and coordinated licensing permitting24  process established by this act is intended to further the25  legislative goal of ensuring through available and reasonable
26  methods that the location of transmission line corridors and
27  the construction, operation, and maintenance of electric28  transmission lines produce minimal adverse effects on the29  environment and public health, safety, and welfare while not30  unduly conflicting with the goals established by the31  applicable local comprehensive plan. It is the intent of this                                  94CODING: Words stricken are deletions; words underlined are additions.

This additional data must be submitted17  within 14 days after the determination by the department.18         3.  If the department, within 14 days after receiving19  the additional data, determines that the data remains20  incomplete, the incompleteness of the data is deemed a21  withdrawal of the proposed alternate corridor. The department22  may make its determination based on recommendations made by23  other affected agencies.

If such additional28  data is determined insufficient, such insufficiency of data29  shall be deemed a withdrawal of the proposed alternate30  corridor.

23  rescheduled, the rescheduling shall not provide the
24  opportunity for parties to file additional alternate corridors
25  to the applicant's proposed corridor or any accepted alternate
26  corridor. However, an amendment to the application which
27  changes the alignment of the applicant's proposed corridor
28  shall require rescheduling of the certification hearing, if
29  necessary, so as to allow time for a party to file alternate
30  corridors to the realigned proposed corridor for which the
31  application has been amended. Any such alternate corridor                                 120CODING: Words stricken are deletions; words underlined are additions.

 3  amendment, provided that the administrative law judge for good
 4  cause shown may authorize another starting or ending point in
 5  the area of the applicant's amended corridor.
 6         (3)(a)  Notwithstanding the rejection of a proposed 7  alternate corridor by the applicant or the department, any 8  party may present evidence at the certification hearing to
 9  show that a corridor proper for certification does not satisfy
10  the criteria listed in s. 403.529 or that a rejected alternate
11  corridor would meet the criteria set forth in s. 403.529. No12  Evidence may not shall be admitted at the certification13  hearing on any alternate corridor, unless the alternate14  corridor was proposed by the filing of a notice at least 45 5015  days before prior to the originally scheduled certification16  hearing pursuant to this section.
