 Beginning in 2014, IPAB will issue recommendations to lower Medicare costs in the event that spending exceeds targets established in the health care reform law.
 This brief explains how the Independent Payment Advisory Board will be structured, the process and timelines for IPAB to make recommendations to achieve Medicare savings and the scope of its recommendations.
 It also explores issues and questions that have been raised about IPAB, its implementation, and its workings in practice.
 The brief was authored by Jack Ebeler of Health Policy Alternatives and Tricia Neuman and Juliette Cubanski of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
