From July to September, Education Week tracked the first-day instructional plans for over 900 of the nation’s 13,000 public school districts.
 The collection captures what school reopenings looked like in this most unorthodox year.
 This data provides a snapshot of how districts began the 2020-21 school year.
 We did not track changes after a district's first day of classes.
 When the project concluded Sept. 22, the dataset included:   907 districts The 100 largest districts in the U.S., including Puerto Rico The largest district in each state At least 5 districts from each state (exceptions are Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico)   Some key findings:  74% of the 100 largest school districts, chose remote learning only as their back-to-school instructional model, affecting over 9 million students.
 Almost half (49%) of all districts opened with remote learning.
 Hybrid instruction was used in 27% of the school districts.
 Full in-person instruction was available to all students in 24% of the districts.
