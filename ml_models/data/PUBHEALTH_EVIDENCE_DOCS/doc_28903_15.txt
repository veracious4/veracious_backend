water use is high; or it may be discovered that 
too much water is applied to shallow hard pan 
soils creating a water l
ogged soil; or, that too 
much water is applied to well drained soils 
increasing energy and water costs.  A water meter is the most direct way of tracking 
irrigation amounts. Howeve
r, irrigation amounts 
can also be determined by noting pumping time 
per irrigation along with pump discharge rate as 
shown in the above example. Table 1 shows a 
simple format for keeping records of irrigations 
and irrigation amounts. 
 Another Example: You have 50 
acres of drip 
irrigated vineyard with
 454 vines per acre. The 
average E.T. for this vineyard during the month 
of July is 0.2 acre-inches per day. How many 

gallons of water must be applied daily to the 
vineyard to keep up 
with E.T.? How many 
gallons does an individual vine use each day? 
The answers are 271,500 gallons per day for the 
50 acre vineyard, and 12 gallons per day for an 
individual vine.  Calculated as follows: 
1) Vineyard E.T. (gals/acre/day)  = 0.2 inches/day x 27,154 gals/inch     
= 5430 gallons per day acre 
per day; 5430 gallons per acre x 50 acres  
    
= 271,500 gallons per day 
for the entire 50 acres 
2) Vine E.T. (gals/vine/day)
  = 5430 gals per acre/454 vines per acre     = 
12 gallons per vine per day With a water meter, drip irrigations are 
scheduled so that the 271,500 gallons of water 
required daily by the 50 acre vineyard are 
metered out accurately. Without a water meter, 
the irrigator must know the average flow of the 
drippers. For example, if every grapevine has 
two drippers and the average dripper flow is Â½ 
gallon per hour; then, the drip system needs to 
run 12 hours each day to apply the required 12 
gallons per vine - which is equal to 5430 gallons 
per acre, which is equal to 271,500 gallons for 
50 acres. 
 Final Example: The evapotranspiration rate of 
a deciduous orchard during July averages 0.22 
acre-inches per day. What is the E.T. of this 
orchard in gallons per minute per acre? You 
irrigate with a low volume irrigation system 
which has an application efficiency of 80%; 
what would be the minimum size pump 
discharge for one acre to meet the orchards E.T. 
requirement, allowing for the system 
inefficiency? The answers are 4.1 and 5.1 
gallons per minute, respectively. 
 Calculated as follows: 
1)E.T.  =0.22 inches per day x 27,154 
gallons per inch      =5974 gallons per acre per day 
2)E.T.  =5974 gallons per day/24 hours 
per day      =249 gallons per acre per hour  
3)E.T.  =249 gallons per hour/60 
minutes per hour  
    
=4.1 gallons per minute per 
acre 4)Pump requirement =4.1 gallons per minute/0.8 
    
=5.2 gallons per minute per 
acre   To keep up with the E.T. of 
one acre during 
July, a pump discharging 5.2 GPM would have 
 to run 24 hours a day (assuming the irrigation 
system has an application efficiency of 80%). 
 Note: To allow for down time and more 
flexibility, most irrigato
rs would like to have a 
minimum pump capacity of 10 GPM per 
acre. Therefore, a 50 acre farm would require a 
pumping capacity of 500 GPM, etc.
