 Executive Summary 
The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Prote
ction (MassDEP) in collaboration 
with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health 
(MDPH) convened a panel of independent 
experts to identify any documented or potential hea
lth impacts of risks that may be associated 
with exposure to wind turbines, and, specifically, 
to facilitate discussion of wind turbines and 
public health based on scientific findings.   
While the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has goals f
or increasing the use of wind 
energy from the current 40 MW to 2000 MW by the yea
r 2020, MassDEP recognizes there are 
questions and concerns arising from harnessing wind
 energy.  The scope of the Panel™s effort 
was focused on health impacts of wind turbines 
per se
.  The panel was 
not
 charged with 
considering any possible benefits of avoiding adver
se effects of other energy sources such as 
coal, oil, and natural gas as a result of switching
 to energy from wind turbines.  
Currently, ﬁregulationﬂ of wind turbines is done at
 the local level through local boards of 
health and zoning boards.  Some members of the publ
ic have raised concerns that wind turbines 
may have health impacts related to noise, infrasoun
d, vibrations, or shadow flickering generated 
by the turbines.  The goal of the Panel™s evaluatio
n and report is to provide a review of the 
science that explores these concerns and provides u
seful information to MassDEP and MDPH 
and to local agencies that are often asked to respo
nd to such concerns.  The Panel consists of 
seven individuals with backgrounds in public health
, epidemiology, toxicology, neurology and 
sleep medicine, neuroscience, and mechanical engine
ering.  All of the Panel members are 
considered independent experts from academic instit
utions.   
In conducting their evaluation, the Panel conducted
 an extensive literature review of the 
scientific literature as well as other reports, pop
ular media, and the public comments received by 
the MassDEP.

a total of three times.  In addition, calls were al
so held with Panel members to further clarify 
points of discussion.  An independent facilitator s
upported the Panel™s deliberations.  Each Panel 
member provided written text based on the literatur
e reviews and analyses.  Draft versions of the 
report were reviewed by each Panel member and the P
anel reached consensus for the final text 
and its findings. 

ES 3. Report Introduction and Description 
Many countries have turned to wind power as a clean
 energy source because it relies on 
the wind, which is indefinitely renewable; it is ge
nerated ﬁlocally,ﬂ thereby providing a measure 
of energy independence; and it produces no carbon d
ioxide emissions when operating.  There is 
interest in pursuing wind energy both on-land and o
ffshore.  For this report, however, the focus 
is on land-based installations and all comments are
 focused on this technology.  Land-based

 wind turbines currently range from 100 kW to 3 MW (
3000 kW).  In Massachusetts, the largest 
turbine is currently 1.8 MW.  
The development of modern wind turbines has been an
 evolutionary design process, 
applying optimization at many levels.  An overview 
of the characteristics of wind turbines, noise, 
and vibration is presented in Chapter 2 of the repo
rt.  Acoustic and seismic measurements of 
noise and vibration from wind turbines provide a co
ntext for comparing measurements from 
epidemiological studies and for claims purported to
 be due to emissions from wind turbines.  
Appendices provide detailed descriptions and equati
ons that allow a more in-depth 
understanding of wind energy, the structure of the 
turbines, wind turbine aerodynamics, 
installation, energy production, shadow flicker, ic
e throws, wind turbine noise, noise 
propagation, infrasound, and stall vs. pitch contro
lled turbines.  
Extensive literature searches and reviews were cond
ucted to identify studies that 
specifically evaluate human population responses to
 turbines, as well as population and 
individual responses to the three primary character
istics or attributes of wind turbine operation: 
noise, vibration, and flicker.  An emphasis of the 
Panel™s efforts was to examine the biological 
plausibility or basis for health effects of turbine
s (noise, vibration, and flicker).  Beyond 
traditional forms of scientific publications, the P
anel also took great care to review other non-
peer reviewed materials regarding the potential for
 health effects including information related to 
ﬁWind Turbine Syndromeﬂ and provides a rigorous ana
lysis as to whether there is scientific basis 
for it.  Since the most commonly reported complaint
 by people living near turbines is sleep 
disruption, the Panel provides a robust review of t
he relationship between noise, vibration, and 
annoyance as well as sleep disturbance from noises 
and the potential impacts of the resulting 
sleep deprivation. 
In assessing the state of the evidence for health e
ffects of wind turbines, the Panel 
followed accepted scientific principles and relied 
on several different types of studies.  It 
considered human studies of the most important or p
rimary value.  These were either human 
epidemiological studies specifically relating to ex
posure to wind turbines or, where specific 
exposures resulting from wind turbines could be def
ined, the panel also considered human 
experimental data.  Animal studies are critical to 
exploring biological plausibility and 
understanding potential biological mechanisms of di
fferent exposures, and for providing 
information about possible health effects when expe
rimental research in humans is not ethically

 or practically possible.  As such, this literature 
was also reviewed with respect to wind turbine 
exposures.  The non-peer reviewed material was cons
idered part of the weight of evidence.  In all 
cases, data quality was considered; at times, some 
studies were rejected because of lack of rigor 
or the interpretations were inconsistent with the s
cientific evidence.   
ES 4.  Findings  
The findings in Chapter 4 are repeated here. 

Based on the detailed review of the scientific lite
rature and other available reports and 
consideration of the strength of scientific evidenc
e, the Panel presents findings relative to three 
factors associated with the operation of wind turbi
nes: noise and vibration, shadow flicker, and 
ice throw.  The findings that follow address specif
ics in each of these three areas. 
ES 4.1  Noise 

ES 4.1.a Production of Noise and Vibration by Wind 
Turbines 
1.
 Wind turbines can produce unwanted sound (referred 
to as noise) during operation.  The 
nature of the sound depends on the design of the wi
nd turbine.  Propagation of the sound 
is primarily a function of distance, but it can als
o be affected by the placement of the 
turbine, surrounding terrain, and atmospheric condi
tions.  
a.
 Upwind and downwind turbines have different sound c
haracteristics, primarily 
due to the interaction of the blades with the zone 
of reduced wind speed behind 
the tower in the case of downwind turbines.  
b.
 Stall regulated and pitch controlled turbines exhib
it differences in their 
dependence of noise generation on the wind speed 
c.
 Propagation of sound is affected by refraction of s
ound due to temperature 
gradients, reflection from hillsides, and atmospher
ic absorption.  Propagation 
effects have been shown to lead to different experi
ences of noise by neighbors.  
d.
 The audible, amplitude-modulated noise from wind tu
rbines (ﬁwhooshingﬂ) is 
perceived to increase in intensity at night (and so
metimes becomes more of a 
ﬁthumpingﬂ) due to multiple effects: i) a stable at
mosphere will have larger wind 
gradients, ii) a stable atmosphere may refract the 
sound downwards instead of 
upwards, iii) the ambient noise near the ground is 
lower both because of the stable 
atmosphere and because human generated noise is oft
en lower at night. 
  WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
ES-

| Page
 2.
 The sound power level of a typical modern utility s
cale wind turbine is on the order of 
103 dB(A), but can be somewhat higher or lower depe
nding on the details of the design 
and the rated power of the turbine.  The perceived 
sound decreases rapidly with the 
distance from the wind turbines.  Typically, at dis
tances larger than 400 m, sound 
pressure levels for modern wind turbines are less t
han 40 dB(A), which is below the level 
associated with annoyance in the epidemiological st
udies reviewed.  
3.  Infrasound refers to vibrations with frequencie
s below 20 Hz.  Infrasound at amplitudes 
over 100Œ110 dB can be heard and felt.  Research ha
s shown that vibrations below these 
amplitudes are not felt.  The highest infrasound le
vels that have been measured near 
turbines and reported in the literature near turbin
es are under 90 dB at 5 Hz and lower at 
higher frequencies for locations as close as 100 m.
 4.  Infrasound from wind turbines is not related to
 nor does it cause a ﬁcontinuous 
whooshing.ﬂ 
5.  Pressure waves at any frequency (audible or inf
rasonic) can cause vibration in another 
structure or substance.  In order for vibration to 
occur, the amplitude (height) of the wave 
has to be high enough, and only structures or subst
ances that have the ability to receive 
the wave (resonant frequency) will vibrate.  
ES 4.1.b Health Impacts of Noise and Vibration 
1.
 Most epidemiologic literature on human response to 
wind turbines relates to self-reported 
ﬁannoyance,ﬂ and this response appears to be a func
tion of some combination of the 
sound itself, the sight of the turbine, and attitud
e towards the wind turbine project. 
a.
 There is limited epidemiologic evidence suggesting 
an association between exposure 
to wind turbines and annoyance. 
b.
 There is insufficient epidemiologic evidence to det
ermine whether there is an 
association between noise from wind turbines and an
noyance independent from the 
effects of seeing a wind turbine and vice versa. 
  WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
ES-
6 
| Page
 2.
 There is limited evidence from epidemiologic studie
s suggesting an association between 
noise from wind turbines and sleep disruption.  In 
other words, it is possible that noise 
from some wind turbines can cause sleep disruption.
  
3.
 A very loud wind turbine could cause disrupted slee
p, particularly in vulnerable 
populations, at a certain distance, while a very qu
iet wind turbine would not likely disrupt 
even the lightest of sleepers at that same distance
.  But there is not enough evidence to 
provide particular sound-pressure thresholds at whi
ch wind turbines cause sleep 
disruption.  Further study would provide these leve
ls.  
4.
 Whether annoyance from wind turbines leads to sleep
 issues or stress has not been 
sufficiently quantified.  While not based on eviden
ce of wind turbines, there is evidence 
that sleep disruption can adversely affect mood, co
gnitive functioning, and overall sense 
of health and well-being. 
5.
 There is insufficient evidence that the noise from 
wind turbines is 
directly (i.e., 
independent from an effect on annoyance or sleep) 
causing health problems or disease.  
6.
 Claims that infrasound from wind turbines directly 
impacts the vestibular system have 
not been demonstrated scientifically.  Available ev
idence shows that the infrasound levels 
near wind turbines cannot impact the vestibular sys
tem.   
a.
 The measured levels of infrasound produced by moder
n upwind wind turbines at 
distances as close as 68 m are well below that requ
ired for non-auditory perception 
(feeling of vibration in parts of the body, pressur
e in the chest, etc.).  
b.
 If infrasound couples into structures, then people 
inside the structure could feel a 
vibration.  Such structural vibrations have been sh
own in other applications to lead to 
feelings of uneasiness and general annoyance.  The 
measurements have shown no 
evidence of such coupling from modern upwind turbin
es. 
c.
 Seismic (ground-carried) measurements recorded near
 wind turbines and wind turbine 
farms are unlikely to couple into structures.  
d.
 A possible coupling mechanism between infrasound an
d the vestibular system (via 
the Outer Hair Cells (OHC) in the inner ear) has be
en proposed
 but is not yet fully 
understood or sufficiently explained.  Levels
 of infrasound near wind turbines have 
been shown to be high enough to
 be sensed by the OHC.  However, evidence does not 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
ES-

| Page
 exist to demonstrate the influence of wind turbine-
generated infrasound on vestibular-
mediated effects
 in the brain.
 e.
 Limited evidence from rodent (rat) laboratory studi
es identifies short-lived 
biochemical alterations in cardiac and brain cells 
in response to short exposures to 
emissions at 16 Hz and 130 dB.  These levels exceed
 measured infrasound levels 
from modern turbines by over 35 dB.  
7.
 There is no evidence for a set of health effects, f
rom exposure to wind turbines that could 
be characterized as a "Wind Turbine Syndrome." 
8.
 The strongest epidemiological study suggests that t
here is not an association between 
noise from wind turbines and measures of psychologi
cal distress or mental health 
problems.
  
There were two smaller, weaker, studies: one did no
te an association, one did 
not.  Therefore, we conclude the weight of the evid
ence suggests no association between 
noise from wind turbines and measures of psychologi
cal distress or mental health 
problems
. 9.
 None of the limited epidemiological evidence review
ed suggests an association between 
noise from wind turbines and pain and stiffness, di
abetes, high blood pressure, tinnitus, 
hearing impairment, cardiovascular disease, and hea
dache/migraine. 
ES 4.2  Shadow Flicker 

ES 4.2.a Production of Shadow Flicker 
Shadow flicker results from the passage of the blad
es of a rotating wind turbine between 
the sun and the observer.   
1.
 The occurrence of shadow flicker depends on the loc
ation of the observer relative to the 
turbine and the time of day and year. 
2.
 Frequencies of shadow flicker elicited from turbine
s is proportional to the rotational 
speed of the rotor times the number of blades and i
s generally between 0.5 and 1.1 Hz for 
typical larger turbines. 
3.
 Shadow flicker is only present at distances of less
 than 1400 m from the turbine. 
ES 4.2.b Health Impacts of Shadow Flicker 
1.
 Scientific evidence suggests that shadow flicker do
es not pose a risk for eliciting seizures 
as a result of photic stimulation.  
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
ES-
8 
| Page
 2.
 There is limited scientific evidence of an associat
ion between annoyance from prolonged 
shadow flicker (exceeding 30 minutes per day) and p
otential transitory cognitive and 
physical health effects. 
ES 4.3  Ice Throw 

ES 4.3.a Production of Ice Throw 
Ice can fall or be thrown from a wind turbine durin
g or after an event when ice forms or 
accumulates on the blades.   
1.
 The distance that a piece of ice may travel from th
e turbine is a function of the wind 
speed, the operating conditions, and the shape of t
he ice.  
2.
 In most cases, ice falls within a distance from the
 turbine equal to the tower height, and in 
any case, very seldom does the distance exceed twic

(tower height plus blade length). 
ES 4.3.b Health Impacts of Ice Throw 
1.
 There is sufficient evidence that falling ice is ph
ysically harmful and measures should be 
taken to ensure that the public is not likely to en
counter such ice. 
ES 4.4  Other Considerations 
In addition to the specific findings stated above f
or noise and vibration, shadow flicker 
and ice throw, the Panel concludes the following:  
1.
 Effective public participation in and direct benefi
ts from wind energy projects (such as 
receiving electricity from the neighboring wind tur
bines) have been shown to result in 
less annoyance in general and better public accepta
nce overall. 
ES 5.   Best Practices Regarding Human Health Effec
ts of Wind Turbines 
The best practices presented in Chapter 5 are repea
ted here. 
Broadly speaking, the term ﬁbest practiceﬂ refers t
o policies, guidelines, or 
recommendations that have been developed for a spec
ific situation.  Implicit in the term is that 
the practice is based on the best information avail
able at the time of its institution.  A best 
practice may be refined as more information and stu
dies become available.  The panel recognizes 
that in countries which are dependent on wind energ
y and are protective of public health, best 
practices have been developed and adopted.

 In some cases, the weight of evidence for a specifi
c practice is stronger than it is in other 
cases.  Accordingly, best practice* may be categori
zed in terms of the evidence available, as 
follows:

 ES 5.1 Noise 
Evidence regarding wind turbine noise and human hea
lth is limited.   There is limited 
evidence of an association between wind turbine noi
se and both annoyance and sleep disruption, 
depending on the sound pressure level at the locati
on of concern.  However, there are no 
research-based sound pressure levels that correspon
d to human responses to noise.  A number of 
countries that have more experience with wind energ
y and are protective of public health have 
developed guidelines to minimize the possible adver
se effects of noise.  These guidelines 
consider time of day, land use, and ambient wind sp
eed.  The table below summarizes the 
guidelines of Germany (in the categories of industr
ial, commercial and villages) and Denmark 
(in the categories of sparsely populated and reside
ntial).  The sound levels shown in the table are 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
ES-

 for nighttime and are assumed to be taken immediate
ly outside of the residence or building of 
concern.  In addition, the World Health Organizatio
n recommends a maximum nighttime sound 
pressure level of 40 dB(A) in residential areas.  R
ecommended setbacks corresponding to these 
values may be calculated by software such as WindPr
o or similar software.  Such calculations 
are normally to be done as part of feasibility stud
ies.  The Panel considers the guidelines shown 
below to be Promising Practices (Category 3) but to
 embody some aspects of Field Tested Best 
Practices (Category 2) as well.

*measured at 10 m above ground, outside of residenc
e or location of concern 
 
The time period over which these noise limits are m
easured or calculated also makes a 
difference.  For instance, the often-cited World He
alth Organization recommended nighttime 
noise cap of 40 dB(A) is averaged over one year (an
d does not refer specifically to wind turbine 
noise).  Denmark™s noise limits in the table above 
are calculated over a 10-minute period.  These 
limits are in line with the noise levels that the e
pidemiological studies connect with insignificant 
reports of annoyance.  
The Panel recommends that noise limits such as thos
e presented in the table above be 
included as part of a statewide policy regarding ne
w wind turbine installations.  In addition, 
suitable ranges and procedures for cases when the n
oise levels may be greater than those values 
should also be considered.  The considerations shou
ld take into account trade-offs between 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
ES-
11 
| Page
 environmental and health impacts of different energ
y sources, national and state goals for energy 
independence, potential extent of impacts, etc.   
The Panel also recommends that those involved in a 
wind turbine purchase become 
familiar with the noise specifications for the turb
ine and factors that affect noise production and 
noise control.  Stall and pitch regulated turbines 
have different noise characteristics, especially in
 
high winds.  For certain turbines, it is possible t
o decrease noise at night through suitable control 
measures (e.g., reducing the rotational speed of th
e rotor).  If noise control measures are to be 
considered, the wind turbine manufacturer must be a
ble to demonstrate that such control is 
possible.  
The Panel recommends an ongoing program of monitori
ng and evaluating the sound 
produced by wind turbines that are installed in the
 Commonwealth.  IEC 61400-11 provides the 
standard for making noise measurements of wind turb
ines (International Electrotechnical 
Commission, 2002).  In general, more comprehensive 
assessment of wind turbine noise in 
populated areas is recommended.  These assessments 
should be done with reference to the 
broader ongoing research in wind turbine noise prod
uction and its effects, which is taking place 
internationally.  Such assessments would be useful 
for refining siting guidelines and for 
developing best practices of a higher category. Clo
ser investigation near homes where outdoor 
measurements show A and C weighting differences of 
greater than 15 dB is recommended.   
ES 5.2 Shadow Flicker 
Based on the scientific evidence and field experien
ce related to shadow flicker, Germany has 
adopted guidelines that specify the following: 
1.
 Shadow flicker should be calculated based on the as
tronomical maximum values (i.e., not 
considering the effect of cloud cover, etc.).   
2.
 Commercial software such as WindPro or similar soft
ware may be used for these 
calculations.  Such calculations should be done as 
part of feasibility studies for new wind 
turbines. 
3.
 Shadow flicker should not occur more than 30 minute
s per day and not more than 30 
hours per year at the point of concern (e.g., resid
ences).   
4.
 Shadow flicker can be kept to acceptable levels eit
her by setback or by control of the 
wind turbine.  In the latter case, the wind turbine
 manufacturer must be able to 
demonstrate that such control is possible. 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
ES-

| Page
 The guidelines summarized above may be considered t
o be a Field Tested Best Practice 
(Category 2).  Additional studies could be performe
d, specifically regarding the number of hours 
per year that shadow flicker should be allowed, tha
t would allow them to be placed in Research 
Validated (Category 1) Best Practices. 
 ES 5.3 Ice Throw 
Ice falling from a wind turbine could pose a danger
 to human health.  It is also clear that the 
danger is limited to those times when icing occurs 
and is limited to relatively close proximity to 
the wind turbine.  Accordingly, the following shoul
d be considered Category 1 Best Practices. 
1.
 In areas where icing events are possible, warnings 
should be posted so that no one passes 
underneath a wind turbine during an icing event and
 until the ice has been shed.   
2.
 Activities in the vicinity of a wind turbine should
 be restricted during and immediately 
after icing events in consideration of the followin
g two limits (in meters).   
For a turbine that may not have ice control measure
s, it may be assumed that ice could 
fall within the following limit: 
()HRxthrow
+=25.1
max,
Where: 
R = rotor radius (m), 
H = hub height (m) 
 For ice falling from a stationary turbine, the foll
owing limit should be used: 
()15/
max,
HRUxfall
+=Where: 
U = maximum likely wind speed (m/s) 
The choice of maximum likely wind speed should be t
he expected one-year return 
maximum, found in accordance to the International E
lectrotechnical Commission™s 
design standard for wind turbines, IEC 61400-1. 

Danger from falling ice may also be limited by ice 
control measures.  If ice control 
measures are to be considered, the wind turbine man
ufacturer must be able to demonstrate that 
such control is possible. 

ES 5.4 Public Participation/Annoyance 
There is some evidence of an association between pa
rticipation, economic or otherwise, 
in a wind turbine project and the annoyance (or lac
k thereof) that affected individuals may 
express.  Accordingly, measures taken to directly i
nvolve residents who live in close proximity 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
ES-
13 
| Page
 to a wind turbine project may also serve to reduce 
the level of annoyance.  Such measures may 
be considered to be a Promising Practice (Category 
3).   
ES 5.5 Regulations/Incentives/Public Education 
The evidence indicates that in those parts of the w
orld where there are a significant 
number of wind turbines in relatively close proximi
ty to where people live, there is a close 
coupling between the development of guidelines, pro
vision of incentives, and educating the 
public.  The Panel suggests that the public be enga
ged through such strategies as education, 
incentives for community-owned wind developments, c
ompensations to those experiencing 
documented loss of property values, comprehensive s
etback guidelines, and public education 
related to renewable energy.  These multi-faceted a
pproaches may be considered to be a 
Promising Practice (Category 3).

Introduction to the Study 
The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Prote
ction (MassDEP), in collaboration 
with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health 
(MDPH), convened a panel of independent 
experts to identify any documented or potential hea
lth impacts or risks that may be associated 
with exposure to wind turbines, and, specifically, 
to facilitate discussion of wind turbines and 
public health based on sound science.  While the Co
mmonwealth of Massachusetts has goals for 
increasing the use of wind energy from the current 
40 MW to 2000 MW by the year 2020, 
MassDEP recognizes there are questions and concerns
 arising from harnessing wind energy.  
Although fossil fuel non-renewable sources have neg
ative environmental and health impacts, it 
should be noted that the scope of the Panel™s effor
t was focused on wind turbines and is not 
meant to be a comparative analysis of the relative 
merits of wind energy vs. nonrenewable fossil 
fuel sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas.  C
urrently, ﬁregulationﬂ of wind turbines is done at 
the local level through local boards of health and 
zoning boards.  Some members of the public 
have raised concerns that wind turbines may have he
alth impacts related to noise, infrasound, 
vibrations, or shadow flickering generated by the t
urbines.  The goal of the Panel™s evaluation 
and report is to provide a review of the science th
at explores these concerns and provides useful 
information to MassDEP and MDPH and to local agenci
es who are often asked to respond to 
such concerns.  
The overall context for this study is that the use 
of wind turbines results in positive 
effects on public health and environmental health. 
 For example, wind turbines operating in 
Massachusetts produce electricity in the amount of 
approximately 2,100Œ2,900 MWh annually 
per rated MW, depending on the design of the turbin
e and the average wind speed at the 
installation site.  Furthermore, the use of wind tu
rbines for electricity production in the New 
England electrical grid will result in a significan
t decrease in the consumption of conventional 
fuels and a corresponding decrease in the productio
n of CO
2 and oxides of nitrogen and sulfur 
(see Appendix A for details).  Reductions in the pr
oduction of these pollutants will have 
demonstrable and positive benefits on human and env
ironmental health.  However, local impacts 
of wind turbines, whether anticipated or demonstrat
ed, have resulted in fewer turbines being 
installed than might otherwise have been expected. 
 To the extent that these impacts can be 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

 ameliorated, it should be possible to take advantag
e of the indigenous wind energy resource 
more effectively. 
The Panel consists of seven individuals with backgr
ounds in public health, epidemiology, 
toxicology, neurology and sleep medicine, neuroscie
nce, and mechanical engineering.  With the 
exception of two individuals (Drs. Manwell and Mill
s), Panel members did not have any direct 
experience with wind turbines.  The Panel did an ex
tensive literature review of the scientific 
literature (see bibliography) as well as other repo
rts, popular media, and the public comments 
received by the MassDEP.

Introduction to Wind Turbines
 This chapter provides an introduction to wind turbi
nes so as to provide a context for the 
discussion that follows.  More information on wind 
turbines may be found in the appendices, 
particularly in Appendix A. 

2.1
 Wind Turbine Anatomy and Operation 
Wind turbines utilize the wind, which originates fr
om sunlight due to the differential 
heating of various parts of the earth.  This differ
ential heating produces zones of high and low 
pressure, resulting in air movement.  The motion of
 the air is also affected by the earth™s rotation. 
 
Many countries have turned to wind power as a clean
 energy source because it relies on the 
wind, which is indefinitely renewable; it is genera
ted ﬁlocally,ﬂ thereby providing a measure of 
energy independence; and it produces no carbon diox
ide emissions when operating.  There is 
interest in pursuing wind energy both on-land and o
ffshore.  For this report, however, the focus 
is on land-based installations, and all comments wi
ll focus on this technology. 
The development of modern wind turbines has been an
 evolutionary design process, 
applying optimization at many levels.  This section
 gives a brief overview of the characteristics 
of wind turbines with some mention of the optimizat
ion parameters of interest.  Appendix A 
provides a detailed explanation of wind energy.   
The main features of modern wind turbines one notic
es are the very tall towers, which are 
no longer a lattice structure but a single cylindri
cal-like structure and the three upwind, very 
long, highly contoured turbine blades.  The tower d
esign has evolved partly because of biological 
impact factors as well as for other practical reaso
ns.  The early lattice towers were attractive 
nesting sites for birds.  This led to an unnecessar
y impact of wind turbines on bird populations.  
The lattice structures also had to be climbed exter
nally by turbine technicians.  The tubular 
towers, which are now more common, are climbed inte
rnally.  This reduces the health risks for 
maintenance crews.   
The power in the wind available to a wind turbine i
s related to the cube of the wind speed 
and the square of the radius of the rotor.  Not all
 the available power in the wind can be captured 
by a wind turbine, however.  Betz (van Kuik, 2007) 
showed that the maximum power that can be 
extracted is 16/27 times the available power (see A
ppendix A).  In an attempt to extract the 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
4 
| Page
 maximum power from the wind, modern turbines have v
ery large rotors and the towers are quite 
high.  In this way the dependence on the radius is 
ﬁoptimized,ﬂ and the dependence on the wind 
speed is ﬁoptimized.ﬂ  The wind speed is higher awa
y from the ground due to boundary layer 
effects, and as such, the towers are made higher in
 order to capture the higher speed winds (more 
information about the wind profiles and variability
 is found in Appendix A).  It is noted here that 
the rotor radius may increase again in the future, 
but currently the largest rotors used on land are 
around 100 m in diameter.  This upper limit is curr
ently a function of the radius of curvature of 
the roads on which the trucks that deliver the turb
ine blades must drive to the installation sites.  
Clearance under bridges is also a factor.  
The efficiency with which the wind™s power is captu
red by a particular wind turbine (i.e., 
how close it comes to the Betz limit) is a function
 of the blade design, the gearbox, the electrical 
generator, and the control system.  The aerodynamic
 forces on the rotor blade play a major role.  
The best design maximizes lift and minimizes drag a
t every blade section from hub to tip.  The 
twisted and tapered shapes of modern blades attempt
 to meet this optimal condition.  Other 
factors also must be taken into consideration such 
as structural strength, ease of manufacturing 
and transport, type of materials, cost, etc.  
Beyond these visual features, the number of blades 
and speed of the tips play a role in the 
optimization of the performance through what is cal
led solidity.  When setting tip speeds based 
on number of blades, however, trade-offs exist beca
use of the influence of these parameters on 
weight, cost, and noise.  For instance, higher tip 
speeds often results in more noise.   
The dominance of the 3-bladed upwind systems is bot
h historic and evolutionary.  The 
European manufacturers moved to 3-bladed systems an
d installed numerous turbines, both in 
Europe and abroad.  Upwind systems are preferable t
o downwind systems for on-land 
installations because they are quieter.  The downwi
nd configuration has certain useful features 
but it suffers from the interaction noise created w
hen the blades pass through the wake that forms 
behind the tower.  
The conversion of the kinetic energy of the wind in
to electrical energy is handled by the 
rotor nacelle assembly (RNA), which consists of the
 rotor, the drive train, and various ancillary 
components.  The rotor grouping includes the blades
, the hub, and the pitch control components.  
The drive train includes the shafts, bearings, gear
box (not necessary for direct drive generators), 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
5 
| Page
 couplings, mechanical brake, and generator.  A sche
matic of the RNA, together with more detail 
concerning the operation of the various parts, is i
n Appendix A.  
The rotors are controlled so as to generate electri
city most effectively and as such must 
withstand continuously fluctuating forces during no
rmal operation and extreme loads during 
storms.  Accordingly, in general a wind turbine rot
or does not operate at its own maximum 
power coefficient at all wind speeds.  Because of t
his, the power output of a wind turbine is 
generally described by a relationship, known as a p
ower curve.  A typical power curve is shown 
in the appendix.  Below the cut-in speed no power i
s produced.  Between cut-in and rated wind 
speed the power increases significantly with wind s
peed.  Above the rated speed, the power 
produced is constant, regardless of the wind speed,
 and above the cut-out speed the turbine is 
shut down often with use of the mechanical brake. 
Two main types of rotor control systems exist:  pit
ch and stall.  Stall controlled turbines 
have fixed blades and operate at a fixed speed.  Th
e aerodynamic design of the blades is such 
that the power is self-limiting, as long as the gen
erator is connected to the electrical grid.  Pitch 
regulated turbines have blades that can be rotated 
about their long axis.  Such an arrangement 
allows more precise control.  Pitch controlled turb
ines are also generally quieter than stall 
controlled turbines, especially at higher wind spee
ds.  Until recently, many turbines used stall 
control.  At present, most large turbines use pitch
 control.  Appendices A and F provide more 
details on pitch and stall. 
The energy production of a wind turbine is usually 
considered annually.  Estimates are 
usually obtained by calculating the expected energy
 that will be produced every hour of a 
representative year (by considering the turbine™s p
ower curve and the estimated wind resource) 
and then summing the energy from all the hours.  So
metimes a normalized term known as the 
capacity factor (CF) is used to characterize the pe
rformance.  This is the actual energy produced 
(or estimated to be produced) divided by the amount
 of energy that would be produced if the 
turbine were running at its rated output for the en
tire year.  Appendix A gives more detail on 
these computations.

 2.2  Noise from Turbines 
Because of the concerns about the noise generated f
rom wind turbines, a short summary 
of the sources of noise is provided here.  A thorou
gh description of the various noise sources 
from a wind turbine is given in the text by Wagner 
et al. (1996).  
A turbine produces noise mechanically and aerodynam
ically.  Mechanical noise sources 
include the gearbox, generator, yaw drives, cooling
 fans, and auxiliary equipment such as 
hydraulics.  Because the emitted sound is associate
d with the rotation of mechanical and 
electrical equipment, it is often tonal.  For insta
nce, it was found that noise associated with a 
1500 kW turbine with a generator running at  speeds
 between 1100 and 1800 rpm contained a 
tone between 20 and 30 Hz (Betke et al., 2004).  Th
e yaw system on the other hand might 
produce more of a grinding type of noise but only w
hen the yaw mechanism is engaged.  The 
transmission of mechanical noise can be either airb
orne or structure-borne as the associated 
vibrations can be transmitted into the hub and towe
r and then radiated into the surrounding 
space.   
Advances in gearboxes and yaw systems have decrease
d these noise sources over the 
years.  Direct drive systems will improve this even
 more.  In addition, utility scale wind turbines 
are usually insulated to prevent mechanical noise f
rom proliferating outside the nacelle or tower 
(Alberts, 2006) 
Aerodynamic sound is generated due to complex fluid
-structure interactions occurring on 
the blades.  Wagner et al. (1996) break down the so
urces of aerodynamic sound as follows in 
Table 1.

 Of these mechanisms, the most persistent and often 
strongest source of aerodynamic 
sound from modern wind turbines is the trailing edg
e noise.  It is also the amplitude modulation 
of this noise source due to the presence of atmosph
eric effects and directional propagation effects 
that result in the whooshing or beating sound often
 reported (van den Berg, 2004).  As a turbine 
blade rotates through a changing wind stream, the a
erodynamics change, leading to differences 
in the boundary layer and thus to differences in th
e trailing edge noise (Oerlemans, 2009).  Also, 
the direction in which the blade is pointing change
s as it rotates, leading to differences in the 
directivity of the noise from the trailing edge.  T
his noise source leads to what some people call 
the ﬁwhooshingﬂ sound. 
Most modern turbines use pitch control for a variet
y of reasons.  One of the reasons is 
that at higher wind speeds, when the control system
 has the greatest impact, the pitch controlled 
turbine is quieter than a comparable stall regulate
d turbine would be.  Appendix E shows the 
difference in the noise from two such systems. 
When discussing noise from turbines, it is importan
t to also consider propagation effects 
and multiple turbine effects.  One propagation effe
ct of interest is due to the dependence of the 
speed of sound on temperature.  When there is a lar
ge temperature gradient (which may occur 
during the day due to surface warming or due to top
ography such as hills and valleys) the path a 
sound wave travels will be refracted.  Normally thi
s means that during a typical day sound is 
ﬁturnedﬂ away from the earth™s surface.  However, a
t night the sound propagates at a constant 
height or even be ﬁturnedﬂ down toward the earth™s 
surface, making it more noticeable than it 
otherwise might be. 
The absorption of sound by vegetation and reflectio
n of sound from hillsides are other 
propagation effects of interest.  Several of these 
effects were shown to be influencing the sound 
field near a few homes in North Carolina that were 
impacted by a wind turbine installation 
(Kelley et al., 1985).  A downwind 2-bladed, 2 MW t
urbine was installed on a mountaintop in 
North Carolina.  It created high amplitude impulsiv
e noise due to the interaction of the blades 
and the tower wakes.  Some homes (10 in 1000) were 
adversely affected by this high amplitude 
impulsive noise.  It is shown in the report by Kell
ey et al. (1985) that echoes and focusing due to 
refraction occurred at the location of the affected
 homes. 
In flat terrain, noise in the audible range will pr
opagate along a flat terrain in a manner 
such that its amplitude will decay exactly as dista
nce from the source (1/distance).  Appendix E 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
9 
| Page
 provides formulae for approximating the overall sou
nd level at a given distance from a source.  
In the inaudible range, it has been noted that ofte
n the sound behaves as if the propagation was 
governed by a 1/(distance)
1/2
 (Shepherd & Hubbard, 1991). 
When one considers the noise from a wind farm in wh
ich multiple turbines are located 
close to each other, an estimate for the overall no
ise from the farm can be obtained.  Appendix E 
describes the method for obtaining the estimate.  A
ll these estimates rely on information 
regarding the sound power generated by the turbine 
at the hub height.  The power level for 
several modern turbines is given in Appendix D. 

2.2.a Measurement and Reporting of Noise 
Turbines produce multiple types of sound as indicat
ed previously, and the sound is 
characterized in several ways: tonal or broadband, 
constant amplitude or amplitude modulated, 
and audible or infrasonic.  The first two character
ization pairs have been mentioned previously.  
Audible refers to sound with frequencies from 20 Hz
 to 20 kHz.  The waves in the infrasonic 
range, less than 20 Hz, may actually be audible if 
the amplitude of the sound is high enough.  
Appendix D provides a brief primer on acoustics and
 the hearing threshold associated with the 
entire frequency spectrum. 
Sound is simply pressure fluctuations and as such, 
this is what a microphone measures.  
However, the amplitude of the fluctuations is repor
ted not in units of pressure (such as Pascals) 
but on a decibel scale.  The sound pressure level (
SPL) is defined by 
SPL = 10 log

 [p

(p/p

the resulting number having the units of decibels (

sound is 20 x 10
-6
 Pa (i.e., 20 µPa or 20 micro Pascals).  Some impli
cations of the decibel scale 
are noted in Appendix D. 
When sound is broadband (contains multiple frequenc
ies), it is useful to use averages that 
measure approximately the amplitude of the sound an
d its frequency content.  Standard 
averaging methods such as octave and 1/3-octave ban
d are described in Appendix D.  In essence, 
the entire frequency range is broken into chunks, a
nd the amplitude of the sound at frequencies 
in each chunk is averaged.  An overall sound pressu
re value can be obtained by averaging all of 
the bands.

 When presenting the sound pressure it is common to 
also use a filter or weighting.  The 
A-weighting is commonly used in wind turbine measur
ements.  This filter takes into account the 
threshold of human hearing and gives the same decib
el reading at different frequencies that 
would equate to equal loudness.  This means that at
 low frequencies (where amplitudes have to 
be incredibly high for the sound to be heard by peo
ple) a large negative weight would be applied.  
C-weighting only filters the levels at frequencies 
below about 30 Hz and above 4 kHz and filters 
them only slightly between 0 and 30 Hz.  The weight
 values for both the A and C weightings 
filters are shown in Appendix D, and an example wit
h actual wind turbine data is presented.  
There are many other weighting methods.  For instan
ce, the day-night level filter 
penalizes nighttime noise between the hours of 10 p
.m. and 7 a.m. by adding an additional 10 dB 
to sound produced during these hours.  
When analyzing wind turbine and other anthropogenic
 sound there is a question as to 
what averaging period should be used.  The World He
alth Organization uses a yearly average.  
Others argue though that especially for wind turbin
es, which respond to seasonal variations as 
well as diurnal variations, much shorter averages s
hould be considered.   
2.2.b Infrasound and Low-frequency Noise (IFLN) 
The term
 infrasound
 refers to pressure waves with frequencies less tha
n 20 Hz.  In the 
infrasonic range, the amplitude of the sound must b
e very high for it to be audible to humans.  
For instance, the hearing threshold below 20 Hz req
uires that the amplitude be above 80 dB for it 
to be heard and at 5 Hz it has to be above 103 dB (
O™Neal, 2011; Watanabe & Moeller, 1990).  
This gives little room between the audible and the 
pain values for the infrasound range: 165 dB 
at 2 Hz and 145 dB at 20 Hz cause pain (Leventhal, 
2006). 
The 
low frequency
 range is usually characterized as 20Œ200 Hz (Leven
thal, 2006; 
O™Neal, 2011).  This is within the audible range bu
t again the threshold of hearing indicates that 
fairly high amplitude is required in this frequency
 range as well.  The A-weighting of sound is 
based upon the threshold of human hearing such that
 it reports the measured values adjusted by -
50 dB at 20 Hz, -10 dB at 200 Hz, and + 1 dB at 100
0 Hz.  The A-weighting curve is shown in 
Appendix D.    
It is known that low frequency waves propagate with
 less attenuation than high-frequency 
waves.  Measurements have shown that the amplitude 
for the airborne infrasonic waves can be 
cylindrical in nature, decaying at a rate inversely
 proportional to the square root of the distance 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
11 
| Page
 from the source.  Normally the decay of the amplitu
de of an acoustic wave is inversely 
proportional to the distance (Shepherd & Hubbard, 1
991).   
It is difficult to find reliable and comparable inf
rasound and low frequency noise (ILFN) 
measurement data in the peer-reviewed literature.  
Table 2 provides some examples of such 
measurements from wind turbines.  For each case, th
e reliability of the infrasonic data is not 
known (the infrasonic measurement technique is not 
described in each report), although it is 
assumed that the low frequency noise was captured a
ccurately.  The method for obtaining the 
sound pressure level is not described for each repo
rted data set, and some may come from 
averages over many day/time/wind conditions while o
thers may be just from a single day™s 
measurement campaign.

When these recorded levels are taken at face value,
 one might conclude that the 
infrasonic regime levels are well below the audible
 threshold.  In contrast, the low frequency 
regime becomes audible around 30 Hz.  Such data hav
e led many researchers to conclude that 
the infrasound and low frequency noise from wind tu
rbines is not an issue (Leventhal, 2009; 
O'Neal, 2011; Bowdler, 2009).  Others who have soug
ht explanations for complaints from those 
living near wind turbines have pointed to ILFN as a
 problem (Pierpont, 2009; Branco & Alves-
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
13

 Pereira, 2004).  Some have declared the low frequen
cy range to be of greatest concern 
(Kamperman et al., 2008; Jung, 2008).  
It is important to make the clear distinction betwe
en amplitude-modulated noise from 
wind turbines and the ILFN from turbines.  Amplitud
e modulation in wind turbines noise has 
been discussed at length by Oerlemans (2009) and va
n den Berg (2004).  Amplitude modulation 
is what causes the whooshing sound referred to as s
wish-swish by van den Berg (that sometimes 
becomes a thumping sound).  The whooshing noise cre
ated by modern wind turbines occurs 
because of variations in the trailing edge noise pr
oduced by a rotor blade as it sweeps through its 
path and the directionality of the noise because of
 the perceived pitch of the blade at different 
locations along its 360
° rotation.  The sound is produced in the audible ra
nge, and it is modulated 
so that it is quiet and then loud and then quiet ag
ain at a rate related to the blade passing 
frequency (rate blades pass the tower) which is oft
en around 1 Hz.  Van den Berg (2004) noted 
that the level of amplitude modulation is often gre
ater at night because the difference between 
the wind speed at the top and bottom of the rotor d
isc can be much larger at night when there is a 
stable atmosphere than during the day when the wind
 profile is less severe.  It is further argued 
that in a stable atmosphere there is little wind ne
ar the ground so wind noise does not mask the 
turbine noise for a listener near the ground.  Fina
lly, atmospheric effects can change the 
propagation of the sound refracting the noise towar
ds the ground rather than away from the 
ground.  The whooshing that is heard is NOT infraso
und and much of its content is not at low 
frequency.  Most of the sound is at higher frequenc
y and as such it will be subject to higher 
atmospheric attenuation than the low frequency soun
d.  An anecdotal finding that the whooshing 
sound carries farther when the atmosphere is stable
 does not imply that it is infrasound or heavy 
in low frequency content, it simply implies that th
e refraction of the sound is also different when 
the atmosphere is stable.  It is important to note 
then that when a complaint is tied to the 
thumping or whooshing that is being heard, the comp
laint may not be about ILFN at all even if 
the complaint mentions low frequency noise.  Kamper
man et al. (2008) state that, ﬁIt is not clear 
to us whether the complaints about ﬁlow frequencyﬂ 
noise are about the audible low frequency 
part of the ﬁswoosh-boomﬂ sound, the once-per-secon
d amplitude modulation – of the ﬁswoosh-
boomﬂ sound, or some combination of the two.ﬂ

Health Effects 
3.1
 Introduction 
Chapter 3 reviews the evidence for human health eff
ects of wind turbines.  Extensive 
literature searches and reviews were conducted to i
dentify studies that specifically evaluate 
population responses to turbines, as well as popula
tion and individual responses to noise, 
vibration, and flicker.  The biological plausibilit
y or basis for health effects of turbines (noise, 
vibration, and flicker) was examined.  Beyond tradi
tional forms of scientific publications, the 
Panel also reviewed other non-peer reviewed materia
ls including information related to ﬁWind 
Turbine Syndromeﬂ and provides a rigorous analysis 
of its scientific basis.  Since the most 
commonly reported complaint by people living near t
urbines is sleep disruption, the Panel 
provides a robust review of the relationship betwee
n noise, vibration, annoyance as well as sleep 
disturbance from noises and the potential impacts o
f the resulting sleep deprivation. 
In assessing the state of the evidence for health e
ffects of wind turbines, the Panel relied 
on several different types of studies.  It consider
ed human studies of primary value.  These were 
either human epidemiological studies specifically r
elating to exposure to wind turbines or, where 
specific exposures resulting from wind turbines cou
ld be defined, the Panel also considered 
human experimental data.  Animal studies are critic
al to exploring biological plausibility and 
understanding potential biological mechanisms of di
fferent exposures, and for providing 
information about possible health effects when expe
rimental research in humans is not ethically 
or practically possible (National Research Council 
(NRC), 1991).  As such, this literature was 
also reviewed with respect to wind turbine exposure
s.  In all cases, data quality is considered.  At 
times some studies were rejected because of lack of
 rigor or the interpretations were inconsistent 
with the scientific evidence.  These are identified
 in the discussion below.  
In the specific case of the possibility of ice bein
g thrown from wind turbine blades, the 
Panel discusses the physics of such ice throw in or
der to provide the basis of the extent of the 
potential for injury from thrown ice (see Chapter 2
).

 Human Exposures to Wind Turbines 
Epidemiologic study designs differ in their ability
 to provide evidence of an association 
(Ellwood, 1998).  Typical study designs include ran
domized trials, cohort studies, and case-
control studies and can include elements of prospec
tive follow-up, retrospective assessments, or 
cross-sectional analysis where exposure and outcome
 data are essentially concurrent.  Each of 
these designs has strengths and weaknesses and thus
 can provide varying levels of strength of 
evidence for causal associations between exposures 
and outcomes, which can also be affected by 
analytic choices.  Thus, this literature needs to b
e examined in detail, regardless of study type, to 
determine strength of evidence for causality. 
Review of this literature began with a PubMed searc
h for ﬁwind turbineﬂ or ﬁwind 
turbinesﬂ to identify peer-reviewed literature pert
aining to health effects of wind turbines.  Titles 
and abstracts of identified papers were then read t
o make a first pass determination of whether 
the paper was a study on health effects of exposure
 to wind turbines or might possibly contain 
relevant references to such studies.  Because the p
eer-reviewed literature so identified was 
relatively limited, we also examined several non-pe
er reviewed papers, reports, and books that 
discussed health effects of wind turbines.  All of 
this literature was examined for additional 
relevant references, but for the purposes of determ
ining strength of evidence, we only considered 
such publications if they described studies of some
 sort in sufficient detail to assess the validity 
of the findings.  This process identified four stud
ies that generated peer-reviewed papers on 
health effects of wind turbines.  A few other non-p
eer reviewed documents described data of 
sufficient relevance to merit consideration and are
 discussed below as well. 
3.3
 Epidemiological Studies of Exposure to Wind Turbine
s 
The four studies that generated peer-reviewed paper
s on health effects of wind turbines 
included two from Sweden (E. Pedersen et al., 2007;
 E. Pedersen & Waye, 2004), one from the 
Netherlands (E. Pedersen et al., 2009), and one fro
m New Zealand (Shepherd at al., 2011).  The 
primary outcome assessed in the first three of thes
e studies is annoyance.  Annoyance 
per se
 is 
not a biological disease, but has been defined in d
ifferent ways.  For example, as ﬁa feeling of 
resentment, displeasure, discomfort, dissatisfactio
n, or offence which occurs when noise 
interferes with someone™s thoughts, feelings or dai
ly activitiesﬂ (Passchier-Vermeer, 1993); or ﬁa 
mental state characterized by distress and aversion
, which if maintained, can lead to a 
deterioration of health and well-beingﬂ (Shepherd e
t al., 2010).  Annoyance is usually assessed 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
16 
| Page
 with questionnaires, and this is the case for the t
hree studies mentioned above.  There is 
consistent evidence for annoyance in populations ex
posed for more than one year to sound levels 
of 37 dB(A), and severe annoyance at about 42 dB(A)
 (Concha-Barrientos et al., 2004).  In each 
of those studies annoyance was assessed by question
naire, and the respondent was asked to 
indicate annoyance to a number of items (including 
wind turbines) on a five-point scale (do not 
notice, notice but not annoyed, slightly annoyed, r
ather annoyed, very annoyed).  While 
annoyance as such is certainly not to be dismissed,
 in assessing global burden of disease the 
World Health Organization (WHO) has taken the appro
ach of excluding annoyance as an 
outcome because it is not a formally defined health
 outcome 
per se
 (Concha-Barrientos et al., 
2004).  Rather, to the extent annoyance may cause o
ther health outcomes, those other outcomes 
could be considered directly.  Nonetheless, because
 of a paucity of literature on the association 
between wind turbines and other health outcomes, we
 consider here the literature on wind 
turbines and annoyance. 

3.3.a Swedish Studies 
Both Swedish studies were cross sectional and invol
ved mailed questionnaires to 
potential participants.  For the first Swedish stud
y, 627 households were identified in one of five 
areas of Sweden chosen to have enough dwellings at 
varying distances from wind turbines and of 
comparable geographical, cultural, and topographica
l structure (E. Pedersen & Waye, 2004).  
There were 16 wind turbines in the study area and o
f these, 14 had a power of 600Œ650 kW, and 
the other 2 turbines had 500 kW and 150 kW.  The to
wers were between 47 and 50 m in height. 
Of the turbines, 13 were WindWorld machines, 2 were
 Enercon, and 1 was a Vestas turbine.  
Questionnaires were to be filled out by one person 
per household who was between the ages of 
18 and 75.  If there was more than one such person,
 the one whose birthday was closest to May 
20
th
  was chosen.  It is not clear how the specific 627
 households were chosen, and of the 627, 
only 513 potential participants were identified, al
though it is not clear why the other households 
did not have potential participants.  Of the 513 po
tential participants, 351 (68.4%) responded. 
The purpose of the questionnaire was masked by quer
ying the participant about living 
conditions in general, some questions on which were
 related to wind turbines.  However, a later 
section of the questionnaire focused more specifica
lly on wind turbines, and so the degree to 
which the respondent was unaware about the focus on
 wind turbines is unclear.  A-weighted 
sound levels were determined at each respondent™s d
welling, and these levels were grouped into 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
17 
| Page
 6 categories (in dB(A): <30, 30Œ32.5, 32.5Œ35, 35Œ3
7.5, 37.5Œ40, and >40).  Ninety-three 
percent of respondents could see a wind turbine fro
m their dwelling. 
The main results of this study were that there was 
a significant association between noise 
level and annoyance.  This association was attenuat
ed when adjusted for the respondent™s 
attitude towards the visual impact of the turbines,
 which itself was a strong predictor of 
annoyance levels, but the association with noise st
ill persisted.  Further adjustment for noise 
sensitivity and attitude towards wind turbines in g
eneral did not change the results.  The authors 
indicated that the reporting of sleep disturbances 
went up with higher noise categories, but did 
not report on the significance of this association.
  Nor did the authors report on associations with 
other health-related questions that were apparently
 on the questionnaire (such as headache, 
undue tiredness, pain and stiffness in the back, ne
ck or shoulders, or feeling tensed/stressed, or 
irritable). 
The 68% response rate in this study is reasonably g
ood, but it is somewhat disconcerting 
that the response rate appeared to be higher in the
 two highest noise level categories (76% and 
78% vs. 60Œ69%).  It is not implausible that those 
who were annoyed by the turbines were more 
inclined to return the questionnaire.  In the lowes
t two sound categories (<32.5 dB(A)) nobody 
reported being more than slightly annoyed, whereas 
in the highest two categories 28% (37.5Œ40 
dB(A)) and 44% (>40 dB(A)) reported being more than
 slightly annoyed (unadjusted 
percentages).  Assuming annoyance would drive retur
ning the questionnaires, this would suggest 
that the percentages in the highest categories may 
be somewhat inflated.  The limited description 
of the selection process in this study is a limitat
ion as well, as is the cross sectional nature of th
e 
study.  Cross-sectional studies lack the ability to
 determine the temporality of cause and effect; in 
the case of these kinds of studies, we cannot know 
whether the annoyance level was present 
before the wind turbines were operational from a cr
oss sectional study design.  Furthermore, 
despite efforts to blind the respondent to the emph
asis on wind turbines, it is not clear to what 
degree this was successful. 
The second Swedish study (E. Pedersen & Persson Way
e, 2007) took a similar approach 
to the first, but in this study the selection proce
dures were explained in more detail and were 
clearly rigorous.  Specific details on the wind tur
bines in the area were not provided, but it was 
noted that areas were sought with wind turbines tha
t had a nominal power of more than 500 kW, 
although some of the areas also contained turbines 
with lower power.  A later publication by 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
18 
| Page
 these authors (Pedersen et al., 2009) indicates tha
t the turbines in this study were up to 1.5 MW 
and up to 65 m high.  In the areas chosen, either a
ll households were recruited or a random 
sample was used.  In this study 1,309 questionnaire
s were sent out and 754 (57.6%) were 
returned.  The response rate by noise category leve
l, however, was not reported.  There was a 
clear association between noise level and hearing t
urbine noise, with the percentage of those 
hearing turbine noise steadily increasing across th
e noise level categories.  However, despite a 
significant unadjusted association between noise le
vels and annoyance (dichotomized as more 
than slightly annoyed or not), and after adjusting 
for attitude towards wind turbines or visual 
aspects of the turbines (e.g., visual angle on the 
horizon, an indicator of how prominent the 
turbines are in the field of view), each of which w
as strongly associated with annoyance, the 
association with noise level category was lost.  Th
e model from which this conclusion was 
drawn, however, imposed a linear relation on the as
sociation between noise level category and 
annoyance.  But in the crude percentages of people 
annoyed across noise level categories, it 
appeared that the relation might not be linear, but
 rather most prevalent in the highest noise.  The 
percentage of those in the highest noise level cate
gory (>40 dB(A)) reporting annoyance (~15%) 
appeared to be higher than among people in the lowe
r noise categories (<5%). 
Given the more rigorous description of the selectio
n process in this study, it has to be 
considered stronger than the first Swedish study.  
While 58% is pretty good for a questionnaire 
response rate, the non-response levels still leave 
room for bias.  The authors do not report the 
response rate by noise level categories, but if the
 pattern is similar to the first Swedish study, it 
could suggest that the percentage annoyed in the hi
ghest noise category could be inflated.  The 
cross sectional nature of the study is also a limit
ation and complicates interpretation of the 
effects on the noise-annoyance association of adjus
tment for the other factors.  Regarding the 
loss of the association after adjustment for attitu
de, if one assumes that the noise levels caused a 
negative attitude towards wind turbines, then the l
oss of association between noise and 
annoyance after adjusting for attitude does not arg
ue against annoyance being caused by 
increasing turbine noise, but rather that that is t
he path by which noise causes annoyance (louder 
noise
negative attitude
annoyance).  If, on the other hand, the attitude to
wards turbines was 
not caused by the noise, then the results would sug
gest that noise levels did not cause the 
annoyance.  Visual angle, however, clearly does not
 cause the noise level; thus, the lack of 
association between noise and annoyance in analyses
 adjusted for visual angle more strongly 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
19 
| Page
 suggest that the turbine noise level is not causing
 the annoyance, but perhaps the visual intrusion 
instead.  This is similar to the conclusion of an e
arlier Danish report (T. H. Pedersen & Nielsen, 
1994).  Either way, however, the data still suggest
 that there may be an association between 
turbine noise and annoyance when the noise levels a
re >40 dB(A).  
A more intricate statistical model of the associati
on between turbine noise levels and 
annoyance that used the data from both Swedish stud
ies was reported separately (Pedersen & 
Larsman, 2008).  The authors used structural equati
on models (SEMs) to simultaneously account 
for several aspects of visual attitude towards the 
turbines and general attitude towards the 
turbines.  These analyses suggested a significant a
ssociation between noise levels and annoyance 
even after considering other factors.   

3.3.b Dutch Study 
The Dutch study aimed to recruit households that re
flected general wind turbine exposure 
conditions over a range of background sound levels.
  All areas within the Netherlands that were 
characterized by one of three clearly defined land-
use typesŠbuilt-up area, rural area with a 
main road, and rural area without a main roadŠand t
hat had at least two wind turbines of at least 
500 kW within 500 meters of each other were selecte
d for the study.  Sites dominated by 
industry or business were excluded.  All addresses 
within these areas were obtained and 
classified into one of five wind turbine noise cate
gories (<30, 30Œ35, 35Œ40, 40Œ45, and >45 
dB(A)) based on characteristics of nearby wind turb
ines, measurements of sound from those 
turbines, and the International Standards Organizat
ion (ISO) standard model of wind turbine 
noise propagation.  Individual households were rand
omly selected for recruitment within 
noise/land type categories, except for the highest 
noise level for which all households were 
selected because of the small number exposed at the
 wind turbine noise levels of the highest 
category.   
As with the Swedish studies, the Dutch study was cr
oss sectional and involved a mailed 
questionnaire modeled on the one used in the Swedis
h studies.  Of 1,948 mailed surveys, 725 
(37%) were returned.  There was only minor variatio
n in response rate by turbine noise category, 
although unlike the Swedish studies, the response r
ate was slightly lower in the higher noise 
categories.  A random sample of 200 non-responders 
was sent an abbreviated questionnaire 
asking only two questions about annoyance from wind
 turbine noise.  There was no difference in 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
20 
| Page
 the distribution of answers to these questions amon
g these non-responders and those who 
responded to the full questionnaire.  
One of the more dramatic findings of this study was
 that among people who benefited 
economically from the turbines (n=100; 14%)Šwho wer
e much more commonly in the higher 
noise categoriesŠthere was virtually no annoyance (
3%) despite the same pattern of noticing the 
noise as those who did not benefit economically.  I
t is possible that this is because attitude 
towards turbines drives annoyance, but it was also 
suggested that those who benefit 
economically are able to turn off the turbines when
 they become annoying.  However, it is not 
clear how many of those who benefited economically 
actually had that level of control over the 
turbines.   
Similarly, there was very little annoyance among pe
ople who could not see a wind 
turbine from their residence even when those people
 were in higher noise categories (although 
none were in the highest category).  In models that
 adjusted for visibility of wind turbines and 
economic benefit, sound level was still a significa
nt predictor of annoyance.  However, because 
of the way in which sound and visibility were model
ed in this analysis, the association between 
higher noise levels and higher annoyance could have
 been driven entirely by those who could see 
a wind turbine, while there could still have been n
o association between wind turbine noise level 
and annoyance among those who could not see a wind 
turbine.  Thus, this study has to be 
considered inconclusive with respect to an associat
ion between wind turbine sound level and 
annoyance 
independent of
 the effect of seeing a wind turbine (and vice vers
a). 
The Dutch study has the limitation of being cross s
ectional as were the Swedish studies, 
and the non-response in the Dutch study was much la
rger than in the Swedish studies.  The 
results of the limited assessment of a subset of no
n-responders mitigate somewhat against the 
concerns raised by the low response rate, but not c
ompletely.  
3.3.c New Zealand Study 
The New Zealand study recruited participants from w
hat the authors refer to as two 
demographically matched neighborhoods (an exposed g
roup living near wind turbines and a 
control group living far from turbines), although s
upporting data for this are not presented.  The 
area with the turbines is described as being charac
terized by hilly terrain, with long ridges 
running 250Œ450 m above sea level, on which 66 125 
m high wind turbines are positioned.  The 
power of the turbines is not provided.  For the exp
osed group, participants were drawn from

 those 18 years and older living in 56 houses locate
d within 2 km of a wind turbine, and for the 
control group participants were drawn from those 18
 years and older living in 250 houses located 
at least 8 km from the wind turbines.  It is unclea
r how many participants per household were 
recruited, but the final study sample included 39 p
eople in the exposed group and 158 in the 
control group.  Response rates of 34% for the expos
ed group and 32% for the control group are 
given.  The outcome assessed was response to the ab
breviated version of the WHO™s quality of 
life (QOL)-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF)Ša health-related QOL 
questionnaire.  These questions 
were embedded within a larger questionnaire with va
rious facets designed to mask the focus on 
wind turbines.  Although there were no statisticall
y significant demographic differences between 
the two groups, 43.6% of those in the exposed group
 had a university education while only 
34.2% in the control group did. 
The exposed group was found to have significantly w
orse physical QOL (in particular the 
sleep and energy level items of this scale) and wor
se environmental QOL (in particular ratings of 
how healthy the environment is and satisfaction wit
h the conditions of their living space).  The 
groups did not differ in scores on the social or ps
ychological scales.  The mean ratings for an 
overall QOL item was significantly lower in the exp
osed group.  All of these analyses were 
adjusted for length of residence, but for no other 
variables. 
As with the other studies discussed, this study has
 the limitation of being cross sectional.  
As with the Dutch study, the response rate in the p
resent study is rather low, and unfortunately, 
there are no data in the New Zealand study on non-p
articipants.  This raises concern that self-
selection into the study could differ by important 
factors in some way between the two groups.  
The difference seen in education level between the 
groups exacerbates this concern.  It is also 
unclear whether appropriate statistical analysis me
thods were used given that there may have 
been multiple respondents from the same household, 
which is not stated but would have needed 
to have been accounted for in the analysis.  The la
ck of control for other variables that may be 
related to reporting of QOL is also a limitation.  
In this regard it is important to note that a lack 
of a statistically significant difference in factor
s between groups does not rule out the possibility 
of those factors potentially accounting for some of
 the difference in outcome scores between 
groups, particularly when the sample size is small 
like in this study.  Whether participants could 
see wind turbines was not assessed, but it is likel
y that most if not all in the exposed group could 
and most if not all in the control group could not,
 given their locations.  Given the findings in the 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
22 
| Page
 Swedish and Dutch studies, this means that even if 
the difference in QOL scores seen are due to 
wind turbines, it is possible that it is driven by 
seeing the turbines rather than sound from the 
turbines.  Overall, the level of evidence from this
 study for a causal association between wind 
turbines and reported QOL is limited. 

3.3.d Additional Non-Peer Reviewed Documents 
Papers that appear in the peer-reviewed literature 
have by definition undergone a level of 
review external to the study team by not only the e
ditors of the journal, but also two to three 
(usually) scientists familiar with the field of the
 study and the methodology used.  These hurdles 
provide an opportunity to identify problems with th
e paperŠfrom methodology to interpretation 
of the resultsŠand either provide the opportunity t
o address problems or reject the paper if the 
problems are considered fatal to the interpretation
 of the results.  Non-peer reviewed literature is 
not subject to this external review scrutiny.  This
 does not mean that all peer-reviewed literature 
is of high quality nor that non-peered reviewed lit
erature is necessarily inferior to peer-reviewed 
literature, but it does mean that non-peered review
ed literature does not need to undergo any 
review process to appear.  Indeed, at times studies
 appear in non-peer reviewed outlets precisely 
because they did not meet the bar of quality necess
ary to appear in the peer-reviewed literature.  
Thus, non-peer reviewed literature needs to be scru
tinized with this in mind.  Four such non-
peer-reviewed reports are described below.  In addi
tion to those four, a few early reports of 
annoyance from wind turbines generally found a weak
 relationship between annoyance and the 
equivalent A-weighted SPL, although those studies w
ere mainly based on studies of smaller 
turbines of less than 500 kW (T. H. Pedersen & Niel
sen, 1994; Rand & Clarke, 1990; Wolsink et 
al., 1993). 
Project WINDFARMperception:  Visual and acoustic im
pact of wind turbine farms on 
residents (van den Berg et al., 2008).
  This report describes the study upon which the Du
tch 
paper summarized above (E. Pedersen et al., 2009) i
s based.  The characteristics of the wind 
turbines are thus as described above.  In addition 
to the data that appeared in the peer-reviewed 
literature, this report describes analyses of addit
ional data that was collected.  These additional 
data relate to health effects and turbine noise exp
osure.  The questionnaire assessed stress levels 
with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), a vali
dated scale that has been widely used in 
such studies and which assesses symptoms felt over 
the past several weeks.  In models adjusted 
for age, economic benefit from the turbines, and se
x, there was no association between sound

 levels and stress.  In contrast, there was a signif
icant association between sound levels and 
interrupted sleep (at least once a month), even whe
n further adjusting for background noise 
levels.  This was most obvious at turbine noise lev
els >45 dB(A), but there appeared to be an 
increasing trend in occurrence of interrupted sleep
 with increasing noise categories even across 
the lower noise categories.  This study also asked 
participants about chronic health conditions 
including diabetes, high blood pressure, tinnitus, 
hearing impairment, cardiovascular disease, and 
migraine.  Although no associations were seen betwe
en wind turbine noise and these outcomes 
in adjusted analyses, the chronic nature of these o
utcomes and the lack of data on timing of onset 
with respect to when the wind turbines were introdu
ced make interpreting these negative 
findings difficult. 
Report to the commission related to Moturimu wind f
arm, New Zealand (Phipps, 2007).
  
This report to a commission in New Zealand related 
to the Moturimu wind farm describes a 
survey conducted by Robyn Phipps to investigate the
 visual and acoustical effects experienced 
by residents living at least 2 km from existing win
d farms in the Manawatu and Tararua regions 
of New Zealand.  Most respondents were within 3 km,
 although a few lived further away, as far 
as 15 km.  The characteristics and number of wind t
urbines was not provided.  Although this 
work does not appear to have come out in the peer-r
eviewed literature, reasonable details about 
the methodology are provided. 
Roughly 1,100 surveys were delivered to postal addr
esses and 614 (56%) were returned.  
Participants were asked to rate on a scale of 1Œ5 t
heir agreement with different statements related 
to their perceptions of the wind turbines.  When th
ese questions dealt with visual issues, they 
were framed both positively and negatively (e.g., ﬁ
I think the turbines spoil the view,ﬂ and ﬁI 
think the turbines are quite attractiveﬂ).  This ap
parently was not the case with other questions 
(e.g., ﬁWatching the turbines can create an unpleas
ant physical sensation in my bodyﬂ). 
Overall, 9% of respondents endorsed being ﬁaffected
ﬂ by the flicker of the wind turbines; 
15% were sufficiently bothered by the visual and no
ise effects of the turbines to consider 
complaining, and 10% actually had complained.  Whil
e 56% is a relatively good response rate 
for a mailed survey, the reasons for non-response o
f nearly half of potential participants must be 
considered.  It is possible that non-respondents di
d not care enough about the effects of the wind 
turbines to bother responding, which presumably wou
ld lower the overall percentages that were 
ﬁaffectedﬂ by the turbines.  On the other hand, it 
is not clear how long the turbines were in 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
24 
| Page
 operation prior to the survey, and it is conceivabl
e that some more affected people may have 
moved out of the area before the time of the survey
.   
A further drawback to the reported survey was that 
there was not a determination of how 
the percentage of ﬁaffectedﬂ respondents related to
 distance from the turbines, the ability to see 
the turbines, or noise levels experienced from the 
turbines.  The report cites a lot of literature on 
noise and health effects, and while such effects ha
ve been reported in the literature, they are 
almost uniformly at sound levels above what is usua
lly found for people living near turbines (and 
most certainly higher than those usually reported f
or people living more than 2 km from a 
turbine).  A WHO report provides a good review of t
his literature (WHO, 2009).  The lowest 
threshold levels for seeing any effect are about 35
 dB(A) (maximum per event or L
Amax
) for 
some physiological sleep responses (e.g., EEG, or d
uration of sleep stages), but these thresholds 
are for levels inside the house near the sleeper, w
hich will be much lower than what is 
experienced outside the house.  The lowest threshol
d level for complaints of well-being were 
estimated at 35 dB(A) as a yearly average outside t
he house at night (L
night, outside
).  But for health 
outcomes the thresholds for any effect are much hig
her, for example 50 dB(A) (L
night, outside
) for 
hypertension or myocardial infarction.  
ﬁWind Turbine Syndromeﬂ (Pierpont, 2009)
:  This book describes several people who 
suffer health symptoms that they attribute to wind 
turbines.  Such descriptions can be 
informative in describing phenomena and raising sug
gestions for possible follow-up with more 
rigorous study designs, but generally are not consi
dered evidence for causality.  In this particular 
case, though, there are elements that go beyond the
 most basic symptom descriptions and so 
warrant consideration as a study.  But limitations 
to the design employed make it impossible for 
this work to contribute any evidence to the questio
n of whether there is a causal association 
between wind turbine exposure and health effects.  
Given this, the very term ﬁWind Turbine 
Syndromeﬂ is misleading as it implies a causal role
 for wind turbines in the described health 
symptoms. 
The book describes health symptoms experienced amon
g 38 people from 10 different 
families who lived near wind turbines and subsequen
tly either moved away from the turbines or 
spent significant periods of time away.  The partic
ipants ranged in age from less than 1 to 75 
years old, with 13 (34%) younger than 16 years and 
17 (45%) younger than 22.  The participants 
were queried about their health symptoms before exp
osure to turbines (presumably before the 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
25 
| Page
 turbines were operational), during exposure to turb
ines, and after moving away.  There is an 
impressive detailed description of the extent and s
everity of health symptoms experienced by this 
group, with a core group of symptoms centered aroun
d vibratory responses and termed Visceral 
Vibratory Vestibular Disturbance (VVVD) by Pierpont
.  While these symptoms for the most part 
are attributed to exposure to the wind turbines by 
the participantsŠeither because they appeared 
once the turbines were operational or because they 
seemed to diminish after going away from the 
turbinesŠthe way in which these participants were r
ecruited makes it impossible to draw any 
conclusions about attributing causality to the turb
ines.  
The most critical problem with respect to inferring
 causality from Pierpont™s findings lies 
in how the families were identified for participati
on.  To be included in the study, among other 
criteria, at least one family member had to have se
vere symptoms 
and
 reside near a recently 
erected wind turbine.  In epidemiological terms thi
s is selecting participants based on both 
exposure and outcome, which guarantees a biased (no
n-causal) association between wind 
turbines and symptoms.  While it could be argued th
at other family members may not have had 
severe symptomsŠand so would not be selected based 
on outcomeŠit is hard to consider other 
family members as truly independent observations, a
s their reporting of symptoms, or indeed 
their experiencing of symptoms, could be influenced
 by the more severely affected family 
member.  This is particularly so when the symptoms 
are in the realm of anxiety, sleep 
disturbance, memory, and concentration; and the sev
erely affected family members are reporting 
increased irritability, anger, and shouting.   
Although not always, several of the participants re
ported an improvement of symptoms 
after moving away from the wind turbines.  While th
is is suggestive and should not be 
discounted as something to explore further, the hig
hly selective nature of the interviewed group 
as a whole makes the evidence for causality from th
ese data 
per se
 weak.  There are also many 
factors that change when moving, making it difficul
t to attribute changes to any specific 
difference with certainty.  Additional factors that
 contribute to the inability to infer causality 
from these data include the small sample size, lack
 of detail on the larger population that could 
have been considered for inclusion in the study, an
d lack of detail on precisely how the actual 
participants were recruited.  In addition, while th
e clinical history was extensive, the symptom 
data were all self-reported.  Another complication 
is that there are no precise data on distance to 
turbines, and noise levels or infrasound vibration 
levels at the participants™ homes.  
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

 ﬁAdverse health effects of industrial wind turbines
: a preliminary reportﬂ (Nissenbaum et 
al., 2011)
:  This report describes a study involving question
naire assessment of mental and 
physical health (SF-36), sleep disturbance (Pittsbu
rgh Sleep Quality Index), and sleepiness 
(Epworth Sleepiness Scale) among residents near one
 of two wind farms in Maine (Vinalhaven 
& Mars Hill).  The Mars Hill site is a linear arran
gement of 28 General Electric 1.5 MW 
turbines, sited on a ridgeline.  The Vinalhaven sit
e is a cluster of three similar turbines, sited on 
a 
flat, tree-covered island.  All residents within 1.
5 km of one of the turbines were identified, and 
all those older than 18 years and non-demented were
 considered eligible for the study.  A set of 
households from an area of similar socioeconomic ma
keup but 3Œ7 km from wind turbines were 
also recruited.  The recruitment process involved h
ouse-to-house visits up to three times to 
recruit participants.  Among those within at most 1
.5 km from the nearest turbine, 65 adults were 
identified and 38 (58%; 22 male, 16 female) partici
pated from 23 unique households.  Among 
those 3-7 km from the nearest turbine, houses were 
visited until a similar number of participants 
were recruited.  This process successfully recruite
d 41 adults (18 male, 23 female) from 33 
unique households.  No information was given on the
 number of homes or people approached so 
the participation rate cannot be determined. 
Analyses adjusted for age, sex, and site (the two d
ifferent wind farms) found that those 
living within 1.5 km of a wind turbine had worse sl
eep quality and mental health scores and 
higher ratings of sleepiness than those living 3Œ7 
km from a turbine.  Physical health scores did 
not differ between the groups.  Similar association
s were found when distance to the nearest 
turbine was analyzed as a continuous variable.   
This study is somewhat limited by its sizeŠmuch sma
ller than the Swedish or Dutch 
studies described aboveŠbut nonetheless suggests re
levant potential health impacts of living 
near wind turbines.  There are, however, critical d
etails left out of the report that make it difficul
t 
to fully assess the strength of this evidence.  In 
particular, critical details of the group living 3Œ
7 
km from wind turbines is left out.  It is stated th
at the area is of similar socioeconomic makeup, 
and while this may be the case, no data to back thi
s up are presentedŠeither on an area level or 
on an individual participant level.  In addition, w
hile the selection process for these participants 
is described as random, the process of recruiting t
hese participants by going home to home until 
a certain number of participants are reached is not
 random.  Given this, details of how homes 
were identified, how many homes/people were approac
hed, and differences between those who

 did and did not participate are important to know. 
 Without this, attributing any of the observed 
associations to the wind turbines (either noise fro
m them or the sight of them) is premature.   
3.3.e Summary of Epidemiological Data 
There is only a limited literature of epidemiologic
al studies on health effects of wind 
turbines.  Furthermore, existing studies are limite
d by their cross sectional design, self-reported 
symptoms, limited ability to control for other fact
ors, and to varying degrees of non-response 
rates.  The study that accounted most extensively f
or other factors that could affect reported 
symptoms had a very low response rate (E. Pedersen 
et al., 2009; van den Berg, et al., 2008).   
All four peer-reviewed papers discussed above sugge
sted an association between 
increasing sound levels from wind turbines and incr
easing annoyance.  Such an association was 
also suggested by two of the non-peer reviewed repo
rts that met at least basic criteria to be 
considered studies.  The only two papers to conside
r the influence of seeing a wind turbine (each 
one of the peer-reviewed papers) both found a stron
g association between seeing a turbine and 
annoyance.  Furthermore, in the studies with availa
ble data, the influence of either sound from a 
turbine or seeing a turbine was reducedŠif not elim
inated, as was the case for sound in one 
studyŠwhen both of these factors were considered to
gether.  However, this precise relation 
cannot be disentangled from the existing literature
 because the published analyses do not 
properly account for both seeing and hearing wind t
urbines given the relation between these two 
that the data seem to suggest.  Specifically, the p
ossibility that there may be an association 
between either of those factors and annoyance, but 
possibly only for those who both see and hear 
sound from a turbine, and not for those who either 
do not hear sound from or do not see a 
turbine.  Furthermore, in the one study to consider
 whether individuals benefit economically 
from the turbines in question, there appeared to be
 virtually no annoyance regardless of whether 
those people could see or hear a turbine.  Even if 
one considers the data just for those who could 
see a wind turbine and did not benefit economically
 from the turbines, defining at what noise 
levels the percentage of those annoyed becomes more
 dramatic is difficult.  Higher percentages 
of annoyance did appear to be more consistent above
 40 dB(A).  Roughly 27% were annoyed (at 
least 4 on a 1Œ5 point scale of annoyance; 5 being 
the worst), while roughly 18% were very 
annoyed (5 on a 1Œ5 scale).  The equivalent levels 
of annoyed and very annoyed for 35Œ40 
dB(A) were roughly 15% and 6%, respectively.  These
 percentages, however, should be 
considered upper bounds for a specific relation wit
h noise levels because, with respect to 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
28 
| Page
 estimating direct effects of noise, they are likely
 inflated as a result of both selective participati
on 
in the studies and the fact that the percentages do
 not take into account the effect of seeing a 
turbine.   
Thus, in considering simply exposure to wind turbin
es in general, while all seem to 
suggest an association with annoyance, because even
 the peer-reviewed papers have weaknesses, 
including the cross sectional designs and sometimes
 quite low response rates, 
the Panel 
concludes that there is limited evidence suggesting
 an association between exposure to wind 
turbines and annoyance
.  However, only two of the studies considered both
 seeing and hearing 
wind turbines, and even in these the possible contr
ibutions of seeing and hearing a wind turbine 
were not properly disentangled.  Therefore, 
the Panel concludes that there is insufficient 
evidence to determine whether there is an associati
on between noise from wind turbines 
and annoyance independent from the effects of seein
g a wind turbine and vice versa
.  Even 
these conclusions must be considered in light of th
e possibility suggested from one of the peer-
reviewed studies that there is extremely low annoya
nceŠregardless of seeing or hearing sound 
from a wind turbineŠamong people who benefit econom
ically from the turbines.   
There was also the suggestion that poorer sleep was
 related to wind turbine noise levels.  
While it intuitively makes sense that more noise wo
uld lead to more sleep disruption, there is 
limited data to inform whether this is occurring at
 the noise levels produced from wind turbines.  
An association was indicated in the New Zealand stu
dy, suggested without presenting details in 
one of the Swedish studies, and found in two non-pe
er-reviewed studies.  Therefore, 
the Panel 
concludes that there is limited evidence suggesting
 an association between noise from wind 
turbines and sleep disruption and that further stud
y would quantify precise sound levels 
from wind turbines that disrupt sleep
. 
The strongest epidemiological study to examine the 
association between noise and 
psychological health suggests there is not an assoc
iation between noise from wind turbines and 
measures of psychological distress or mental health
 problems.
  
There were two smaller, weaker, 
studies: one did note an association, one did not. 
 Therefore, 
the Panel concludes the weight of 
the evidence suggests no association between noise 
from wind turbines and measures of 
psychological distress or mental health problems. 
One Swedish study apparently collected data on head
ache, undue tiredness, pain and 
stiffness in the back, neck, or shoulders, or feeli
ng tensed/stressed and irritable, but did not repor
t 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
29

 on analyses of these data.  The Dutch study found n
o association between noise from wind 
turbines and diabetes, high blood pressure, tinnitu
s, hearing impairment, cardiovascular disease, 
and migraine, although this was not reported in the
 peer-reviewed literature.  Therefore, 
the 
Panel concludes that none of the limited epidemiolo
gical evidence reviewed suggests an 
association between noise from wind turbines and pa
in and stiffness, diabetes, high blood 
pressure, tinnitus, hearing impairment, cardiovascu
lar disease, and headache/migraine. 
These conclusions align with those presented in the
 peer-reviewed article by Knopper and 
Ollson (2011).  They write ﬁConclusions of the peer
 reviewed literature differ in some ways from 
those in the popular literature. In peer reviewed s
tudies, wind turbine annoyance has been 
statistically associated with wind turbine noise, b
ut found to be more strongly related to visual 
impact, attitude to wind turbines and sensitivity t
o noise. –  it is acknowledged that noise from 
wind turbines can be annoying to some and associate
d with some reported health effects (e.g., 
sleep disturbance), especially when found at sound 
pressure levels greater than 40 db(A).ﬂ 
3.4
 Exposures from Wind Turbines: Noise, Vibration, Sha
dow Flicker, and Ice Throw 
In addition to the human epidemiologic study litera
ture on exposure to wind turbines and 
health effects described in the section above, the 
Panel assessed literature that could shed light on 
specific exposures resulting from wind turbines and
 possible health effects.  The exposures 
covered here include noise and vibration, shadow fl
icker, and ice throw.  Each of these exposures 
is addressed separately in light of their documente
d and potential health effects.  When health 
effects are described in the popular media, these c
laims are discussed.  
3.4.a  Potential Health Effects Associated with Noi
se and Vibration  
The epidemiologic studies discussed above point to 
noise from wind turbines as a source 
of annoyance.  The studies also noted that some res
pondents note sleep disruption due to the 
turbine noise.  In this section, the characteristic
s of audible and inaudible noise from turbines are 
discussed in light of our understanding of their im
pacts on human health. 
It is clear that when sound levels get too high, th
e sound can cause hearing loss (Concha-
Barrientos et al., 2004).  These sound levels, howe
ver, are outside the range of what one would 
experience from a wind turbine.  There is evidence 
that levels of audible noise below levels that 
cause hearing loss can have a variety of health eff
ects or indicators.  Detail about the evidence 
for such health effects have been well summarized i
n a WHO report that came to several relevant 
conclusions (WHO, 2009).  First, there is sufficien
t evidence for biological effects of noise 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
30 
| Page
 during sleep: increase in heart rate, arousals, sle
ep stage changes and awakening; second, there is 
limited evidence that noise at night causes hormone
 level changes and clinical conditions such as 
cardiovascular illness, depression, and other menta
l illness.  What the WHO report also details is 
observable noise threshold levels for these potenti
al effects.  For such health effects, where data 
are sufficient to estimate a threshold level, that 
level is never below 40 dB(A)Šas a yearly 
averageŠfor noise outside (ambient noise) at nightŠ
and these estimates take into account 
sleeping with windows slightly open.   
One difficulty with the WHO threshold estimate is t
hat a yearly average can mask the 
particular quality of turbine noise that leads surv
ey respondents to note annoyance or sleep 
disruption.  For instance, the pulsatile nature of 
wind turbine noise has been shown to lead to 
respondents claiming annoyance at a lower averaged 
sound level than for road noise (E. 
Pederson, 2004).  Yearly averaging of sound elimina
tes (or smooths) the fluctuations in the 
sound and ignores differences between day and night
 levels.  Regulations may or may not take 
this into account. 
Health conditions caused by intense vibration are d
ocumented in the literature.  These are 
the types of exposures that result from jackhammers
, vibrating hand tools, pneumatic tools, etc.  
In these cases, the vibration is called arm-body or
 whole-body vibration.  Vibration can cause 
changes in tendons, muscles, bones and joints, and 
can affect the nervous system.  Collectively, 
these effects are known as Hand-Arm Vibration Syndr
ome (HAVS).  Guidelines and 
interventions are intended to protect workers from 
these vibration-induced effects (reviewed by 
European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2008
; (NIOSH 1989).  OSHA does not have 
standards concerning vibration exposure.  The Ameri
can Conference of Governmental Industrial 
Hygienists (ACGIH) has developed Threshold Limit Va
lues (TLVs) for vibration exposure to 
hand-held tools.  The exposure limits are given as 
frequency-weighted acceleration (NIOSH, 
1989).  

3.4.a.i  Impact of Noise from Wind Turbines on Slee
p 
The epidemiological studies indicate that noise and
/or vibration from wind turbines has 
been noted as causing sleep disruption.  In this se
ction sleep and sleep disruption are discussed.  
In addition, suggestions are provided for more defi
nitively evaluating the impact of wind 
turbines on sleep.  
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
31

 All sounds have the potential to disrupt sleep.  Si
nce wind turbines produce sounds, they 
might cause sleep disruption.  A very loud wind tur
bine at close distance would likely disrupt 
sleep, particularly in vulnerable populations (such
 as those with insomnia or mood disorders, 
aging populations, or ﬁlight sleepersﬂ), while a re
latively quiet wind turbine would not be 
expected to disrupt even the lightest of sleepers, 
particularly if it were placed at considerable 
distance.  
There is insufficient evidence to provide very spec
ific information about how likely 
particular sound-pressure thresholds of wind turbin
es are at disrupting sleep.  Physiologic studies 
of noises from wind turbines introduced to sleeping
 people would provide these specific levels.  
Borrowing existing data (e.g., Basner, 2011) and gu
idelines (e.g., WHO) about noises at night, 
beyond wind turbines, might help provide reasonable
 judgment about noise limits at night.  But it 
would be optimal to have specific data about the pa
rticular influence that wind turbines have on 
sleep. 
In this section we introduce broad concepts about s
leep, the interaction of sleep and 
noises, and the potential for wind turbines to caus
e that disruption. 
Sleep  
Sleep is a naturally occurring state of altered con
sciousness and reduced physical activity 
that interacts with all aspects of our physiology a
nd contributes daily to our health and well-
being. 
Measurements of sleep in people are typically perfo
rmed with recordings that include 
electroencephalography (EEG).  This can be performe
d in a laboratory or home, and for clinical 
or experimental purposes.  Other physiological para
meters are also commonly measured, 
including muscle movements, lung, and heart functio
n.  
While the precise amount of sleep that a person req
uires is not known, and likely varies 
across different people and different ages, there a
re numerous consequences of reduced sleep 
(i.e., sleep deprivation).  

 Deficiencies of sleep can take numerous forms, inc
luding the inability to initiate sleep; 
the inability to maintain sleep; abnormal compositi
on of sleep itself, such as too little deep sleep 
(sometimes called slow-wave sleep, or stage N3); or
 frequent brief disruptions of sleep, called 
arousals.  Sources of sleep deprivation can be volu

Voluntary sources include staying awake late at nig
ht or awakening early.  These can be for

 work or school, or while engaging in some personal 
activities during normal sleep times.  Sleep 
deprivation can also be caused by myriad involuntar
y and undesired problems (including those 
internal to the body such as pain, anxiety, mood di
sorders) and frequent need to urinate, or by 
numerous sleep disorders (including insomnia, sleep
 apnea, circadian disorders, parasomnias, 
sleep-related movement disorders, etc), or simply b
y the lightening of sleep depth in normal 
aging.  Finally, sleep deprivation can be caused by
 numerous external factors, such as noises or 
other sensory information in the sleeper™s environm
ent. 
Sleep is conventionally categorized into rapid eye 
movement (REM) and non-REM sleep.  
Within the non-REM sleep are several stages of slee
p ranging from light sleep to deep sleep.  
Beyond these traditional sleep categories, the EEG 
signal can be analyzed in a more detailed and 
sophisticated way, including looking at the frequen
cy composition of the signals.  This is 
important in sleep, as we now know that certain sig
natures in the brain waves (i.e., EEG) 
disclose information about who is vulnerable to noi
se-induced sleep disruption, and what 
moments within sleep are most vulnerable (Dang-Vu e
t al., 2010; McKinney et al., 2011). 
Insomnia can be characterized by a person having di
fficulty falling asleep or staying 
asleep that is not better explained by another cond
ition (such as pain or another sleep disorder) 
(see ICSD, 2
nd
 Edition for details of the diagnostic criteria for
 insomnia).  Approximately 25% of 
the general population experience occasional sleep 
deprivation or insomnia.  Sleep deprivation is 
defined by reduced quantity or quality of sleep, an
d it can result in excessive daytime sleepiness 
as well as problems including those associated with
 mood and cognitive function (Roth et al., 
2001; Rogers, 2007; Walker, 2008).  As might be exp
ected, the severity of the sleep deprivation 
has an impact on the level of cognitive functioning
, and real-life consequences can include 
driving accidents, impulsive behaviors, errors in a
ttention, and mood problems (Rogers, 2007; 
Killgore, 2010).  Loss of sleep appears to be cumul
ative, meaning it adds up night after night.  
This can result in subtle impairments in reaction t
imes, decision-making ability, attentional 
vigilance, and integration of information that is s
ometimes only apparent to the sleep-deprived 
individual after an accident or error occurs, and s
ometimes not perceived by the sleep-deprived 
person at all (Rogers, 2007; van Dongen 2003).     

Sleep and Wind Turbines 
Given the effects of sleep deprivation on health an
d well-being, including problems with 
mood and cognition, it is possible that cognitive a
nd mood complaints and other medical or 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
33 
| Page
 psychological issues associated with sleep loss can
 stem from living in immediate proximity to 
wind turbines, if the turbines disrupt sleep.  Exis
ting data, however, on the relationship between 
wind turbines and sleep are inadequate.  Numerous f
actors determine whether a sound disrupts 
sleep.  Broadly speaking, they are derived from fac
tors about the sleeper and factors about the 
sound. 
Case reports of subjective complaints about sleep, 
particularly those not critically and 
objectively appraised in the normal scientific mann
er, are the lowest level of evidence, not 
simply because they lack any objective measurements
, but also because they lack the level of 
scrutiny considered satisfactory for making even cr
ude claims about cause and effect.  For 
instance, consider the case of a person who sleeps 
poorly at home (near a wind turbine), and 
sleeps better when on vacation (away from a wind tu
rbine).  One might conclude from this case 
that wind turbines cause sleep disruption for this 
person, and even generalize that information to 
other people.  But there are numerous factors that 
might make it more likely that a person can 
sleep well on vacation, having nothing to do with t
he wind turbine.  Furthermore, given the 
enormous prevalence of sleep disorders, such as ins
omnia, and the potentially larger prevalence 
of disorders that impinge on sleep, such as depress
ion, it is crucial that these factors be taken into
 
consideration when weighing the evidence pointing t
o a causal effect of wind turbines on sleep 
disruption for the general population.  It is also 
important to obtain objective measurements of 
sleep, in addition to subjective complaints.  
Subjective reports of sleeping well or sleeping poo
rly can be misleading or even 
inaccurate.  People can underestimate or overestima
te the quality of their sleep.  Future studies 
should examine the acoustic properties of wind turb
ines when assessing the elements that might 
disrupt sleep.  There are unique properties of the 
noises wind turbines make, and there are some 
acoustic properties in common with other noises (su
ch as trucks or trains or airplanes).  It is 
important to make these distinctions when assessing
 the effects of wind turbines on noise, by 
using data from other noises.  Without this physiol
ogic, objective information, the effects of 
wind turbines on sleep might be over- or underestim
ated. 
It should be noted that not all sounds impair the a
bility to fall asleep or maintain sleep.  
To the contrary, people commonly use sound-masking 
techniques by introducing sounds in the 
environment that hinder the perception of undesirab
le noises.  Colloquially, this is sometimes 
called ﬁwhite noise,ﬂ and there are certain key aco
ustic properties to these kinds of sounds that 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
34 
| Page
 make them more effective than other sounds.  Differ
ent noises can affect people differently.  The 
emotional valence that is ascribed by an individual
 to a particular sound can have a major 
influence on the ability to initiate or maintain sl
eep.  Certain aspects of sounds are particularly 
alerting and therefore would be more likely to disr
upt sleep at lower sound pressure levels.  But 
among those that are not, there is a wide range of 
responses to these sounds, depending partly on 
the emotional valence ascribed to them.  A noise, f
or instance, that is associated with a 
distressing object, is more likely to impede sleep 
onset. 
Finally, characteristics of sleep physiology change
 across a given night of sleepŠand 
across the life cycle of a personŠand are different
 for different people, including the effects of 
noise on sleep (e.g., Dang-Vu et al., 2010; McKinne
y et al., 2011).  And some people might 
initially have difficulty with noises at night, but
 habituate to them with repeated exposure 
(Basner, 2011).  
In summary, 
sleep is a complex biological state, important for 
health and well-being 
across a wide range of physiologic functions.  To d
ate, no study has adequately examined 
the influence of wind turbines on sleep.
  
Future directions: The precise effects of noise-ind
uced sleep disruption from wind 
turbines may benefit from further study that examin
es sound-pressure levels near the sleeper, 
while simultaneously measuring sleep physiology to 
determine responses of sleep to a variety of 
levels of noise produced by wind turbines.  The pur
pose would be to understand the precise 
sound-pressure levels that are least likely to dist
urb sleep.  It would also be helpful to examine 
whether sleepers might habituate to these noises, m
aking the impact of a given sound less and 
less over time.  Finally, it would be helpful to st
udy these effects in susceptible populations, 
including those with insomnia or mood disorders or 
in aging populations, in addition to the 
general population. 

Summary of Sleep Data

3.4.b Shadow Flicker Considerations and Potential H
ealth Effects 
Shadow flicker is caused when changes in light inte
nsity occur from rotating wind 
turbine blades that cast shadows (see Appendix B fo
r more details on the physics of the 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
35 
| Page
 phenomenon.)  These shadows move on the ground and 
on buildings and structures and vary in 
terms of frequency rate and intensity.  Shadow flic
ker is reported to be less of a problem in the 
United States than in Northern Europe due to higher
 latitudes and lower sun angles in Europe.  
Nonetheless, it can still be a considerable nuisanc
e to individuals exposed to shadow flicker for 
considerable amounts of time per day or year in the
 United States as well.  Shadow flicker can 
vary significantly by wind speed and duration, geog
raphic location of the sunlight, and the 
distance from the turbine blades to any relevant st
ructures or buildings.  In general, shadow 
flicker branches out from the wind turbine in a dec
lining butterfly wing characteristic geographic 
area with higher amounts of flicker being closer to
 the turbine and less flicker in the outer parts 
of the geographic area (New England Wind Energy Edu
cation Project (NEWEEP), 2011; 
Smedley et al., 2010).  Shadow flicker is present u
p until approximately 1400 m, but the 
strongest flicker is up to 400 m from the turbine w
hen it occurs (NEWEEP, 2011).  In addition, 
shadow flicker usually occurs in the morning and ev
ening close to sunrise and sunset when 
shadows are the longest.  Furthermore, shadow flick
er can fluctuate in different seasons of the 
year depending on the geographic location of the tu
rbine such that some sites will only report 
flicker during the winter months while others will 
report it during summer months.  Other factors 
that determine shadow flicker rates and intensity i
nclude objects in the landscape (i.e., trees and 
other existing shadows) and weather patterns.  For 
instance, there is no shadow flicker on cloudy 
days without sun as compared with sunny days.  Also
, shadow flicker speed (shadows passing 
per second) increases with the rotor speed (NRC, 20
07).  In addition, when several turbines are 
located relatively close to one another there can b
e combined flicker from the different blades of 
the different turbines and conversely, if situated 
on different geographic areas around structures, 
shadow flicker can occur at different times of the 
day at the same site from the different turbines 
so pre-planning of siting location is very importan
t (Harding et al., 2008).  General consensus in 
Germany resulted in the guidance of 30 hours per ye
ar and 30 minutes per day (based on 
astronomical, clear sky calculations) as acceptable
 limits for shadow flicker from wind turbines 
(NRC, 2007).  This is similar to the Denmark guidan
ce of 10 hours per year based on actual 
conditions.  

3.4.b.i Potential Health Effects of Flicker 
Because some individuals are predisposed to have se
izures when exposed to certain types 
of flashing lights, there has been concern that win
d turbines had the potential to cause seizures in 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
36 
| Page
 these vulnerable individuals.  In fact, seizures ca
used by visual or photic stimuli are typically 
observed in people with certain types of epilepsy (
Guerrini & Genton, 2004), particularly 
generalized epilepsy.  While it is not precisely kn
own how many people have photosensitivity 
that causes seizures, it appears to be approximatel
y 5% of people with epilepsy, amounting to 
about 100,000 people in the United States.  And man
y of these people will already be treated 
with antiepileptic medications thus reducing this r
isk further.  
Fortunately, not all flashing light will elicit a s
eizure, even in untreated people with 
known photosensitivity.  There are several key fact
ors that likely need to simultaneously occur in 
order for the stimulus to induce a seizure, even am
ong the fraction of people with photosensitive 
seizures.  The frequency of the stimulus is importa
nt as is the stimulus area and pattern (See 
below) (
http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/aboutepilepsy/sei
zures/photosensitivity/gerba.cfm
). 
Frequencies above 10 Hz are more likely to cause ep
ileptic seizures in vulnerable 
individuals, and seizures caused by photic stimulat
ion are generally produced at frequencies 
ranging from greater than 5 Hz.  However, shadow fl
icker frequencies from wind turbines are 
related to the rotor frequency and this usually res
ults in 0.3Œ1.0 Hz, which is outside of the range 
of seizure thresholds according to the National Res
ource Council and the Epilepsy Foundation 
(NRC, 2007).  In fact, studies performed by Harding
 et al. (2008) initially concluded that 
because light flicker can affect the entire retina,
 and even if the eyes are closed that intermittent 
light can get in the retina, suggested that 4 km wo
uld be a safe distance to avoid seizure risk 
based on shadow flicker (Harding et al., 2008).  Ho
wever, a follow-up analysis considering 
different meteorological conditions and shadow flic
ker rates concluded that there appeared to be 
no risk for seizures unless a vulnerable individual
 was closer than 1.2 times the total turbine 
height on land and 2.8 times the total turbine heig
ht in the water, which could potentially result 
in frequencies of greater than 5 Hz (Smedley et al.
, 2010).        
Although some individuals have complained of additi
onal health complaints including 
migraines, nausea, dizziness, or disorientation fro
m shadow flicker, only one government-
sponsored study from Germany (Pohl et al., 1999) wa
s identified for review.  This German study 
was performed by the Institute of Psychology, Chris
tian-Albrechts-University Kiel on behalf of 
the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (B
MWi) and supported by the Office of 
Biology, Energy, and Environment of the Federal Min
istry for Education and Research (BMBF), 
and on behalf of the State Environmental Agency of 
Schleswig.  The purpose of this 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
37 
| Page
 government-sponsored study was to determine whether
 periodic shadow with a duration of more 
than 30 minutes created significant stress-related 
health effects.  The shadows were created by a 
projection system, which simulated the flicker from
 actual wind turbines. 
          Two groups of different aged individuals 
were studied.  The first group consisted of 32 
students (average age 23 years).  The second group 
included 25 professionals (average age 47 
years).  Both men and women were included.  The sub
jects were each randomly assigned to one 
of two experimental groups, so there was a control 
group and an experimental group.  The 
experimental group was exposed to 60 minutes of sim
ulated flicker.  For the control group 
lighting conditions were the same as in the experim
ental group, but without periodic shadow.  
The main part of the study consisted of a series of
 six test and measurement phases, two before 
the light was turned on, three each at intervals of
 20 minutes while the simulated shadow 
flickering was taking place, and one more after the
 flicker light was turned off.  Among the 
variables measured were general performance indicat
ors of stress (arithmetic, visual search 
tasks) and those of mental and physical well-being,
 cognitive processing, and stress in the 
autonomic nervous system (heart rate, blood pressur
e, skin conductance, and finger temperature).  
Systematic effects due to the simulated flicker cou
ld be detected in comparable ways in both 
exposure groups studied.  Both physical and cogniti
ve effects were found in this exposure 
scenario for shadow flicker.   
It appears clear that shadow flicker can be a signi
ficant annoyance or nuisance to some 
individuals, particularly if they are wind project 
non-participants (people who do not benefit 
economically or receive electricity from the turbin
e) whose land abuts the property where the 
turbine is located.  In addition, flashing (a pheno
menon closely related to shadow flicker, but due 
to the reflection of sunlight Œ see Appendix B) can
 be a problem if turbines are sited too close to 
highways or other roadways.  This could cause dange
rous conditions for drivers.  Accordingly, 
turbine siting near highways should be planned so a
s to reduce flashing as much as possible to 
protect drivers.  However, use of low reflective tu
rbine blades is commonly employed to reduce 
this potential flashing problem.  Provisions to avo
id many of these potential health and 
annoyance problems appear to be employed as current
 practice in many pre-planning sites with 
the use of computer programs such as WindPro.  Thes
e programs can accurately determine 
shadow flicker rates based on input of accurate ana
lysis area, planned turbine location, the 
turbine design (height, length, hub height, rotor d
iameter, and blade width), and residence or

 roadway locations.  Many of these computer programs
 can then create maps indicating the 
location and incidence of shadow flicker.  Such pro
grams may also provide estimates of daily 
minutes and hours per year of expected shadow flick
er that can then be used for wind turbine 
planning and siting or for mitigation efforts.  Sev
eral states require these analyses to be 
performed before any new turbine projects can be im
plemented.  
3.4.b.ii Summary of Impacts of Flicker 
Collectively, although shadow flicker can be a cons
iderable nuisance particularly to wind 
turbine project non-participants, the evidence sugg
ests that there is no risk of seizure from 
shadow flicker caused by wind turbines.  In additio
n, there is limited evidence primarily from a 
German government-sponsored study (Pohl et al., 199
9) that prolonged shadow flicker (more 
than 30 minutes) can result in transient stress-rel
ated effects on cognition (concentration, 
attention) and autonomic nervous system functioning
 (heart rate, blood pressure).  There was 
insufficient documentation to evaluate other than a
necdotal reports of additional health effects 
including migraines or nausea, dizziness or disorie
ntation.  There are documented mitigation 
methods for addressing shadow flicker from wind tur
bines and these methods are presented in 
Appendix B.  

3.4.c  Ice Throw and its Potential Health Effects 
Under certain weather conditions ice may form on th
e surface of wind turbine blades.  
Normally, wind turbines intended for use in locatio
ns where ice may form are designed to shut 
down when there is a significant amount of ice on t
he blades.  The means to prevent operation 
when ice is present may include ice sensor and vibr
ation sensors.  Ice sensors are used on most 
wind turbines in cold climates.  Vibration sensors 
are used on nearly all wind turbines.  They 
would cause the turbine to shut down, for example, 
if ice buildup on the blades resulted in an 
imbalance of the rotor and hence detectable vibrati
ons in the structure. 
  Ice built up on blades normally falls off while t
he turbine is stationary.  If that occurs 
during high winds, the ice could be blown by the wi
nd some distance from the tower.  In 
addition, it is conceivable that ice could be throw
n from a moving wind turbine blade under 
some circumstances, although that would most likely
 occur only during startup (while the 
rotational speed is still relatively low) or as a r
esult of the failure of the control system.  It is 
therefore worth considering the maximum plausible d
istance that a piece of ice could land from 
the turbine under two ﬁworst caseﬂ circumstances: 1
) ice falls from a stopped turbine during very 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
39 
| Page
 high winds, and 2) ice is suddenly released from a 
blade when the rotor is rotating at its normal 
operating speed. 
Ice is a physical hazard, that depending on the mas
s, velocity, and the angle of throw can 
result in a wide range of effects to humans: alarm 
and surprise to abrasions, organ damage, 
concussions, and perhaps death.  Avoidance of ice t
hrow is critical.  More detail on ice throw and 
options for mitigation are presented in Appendix C.
 3.5
 Effects of Noise and Vibration in Animal Models 

Domestic animals such as cats and dogs can serve as
 sentinels of problematic 
environmental conditions.  The Panel searched for l
iterature that might point to non-laboratory 
animal studies or well-documented cases of animals 
impacted by wind turbines.  Anecdotal 
reports in the press of goat deaths (UK), premature
 births and adverse effects in cows (Japan, 
US) provide circumstantial evidence, but lack speci
fics regarding background rates of illness or 
extent of impact.  
Laboratory-based animal models are often used to pr
edict and to develop mechanistic 
explanations of the causes of disease by external f
actors, such as noise or chemicals in humans.  
In the absence of robust epidemiological data, anim
al models can provide clues to complex 
biological responses.  However, the limitations of 
relying on animal models are well 
documented, particularly for endpoints that involve
 the brain.  The benefits of using an animal 
model include ease of experimental manipulation suc
h as multiple exposures, typically well-
controlled experimental conditions, and genetically
 identical groups of animals.  
Evaluation of biological plausibility for the multi
tude of reported health effects of wind 
turbines requires a suitable animal model documente
d with data that demonstrate cause and 
effect.  Review of this literature began with a Pub
Med and ToxNet search for ﬁwind turbineﬂ or 
ﬁwind turbinesﬂ; or ﬁinfrasoundﬂ or ﬁlow frequency 
noiseﬂ; and ﬁanimalﬂ or ﬁmammalﬂ to 
identify peer-reviewed studies in which laboratory 
animals were exposed to noise or vibration 
intended to mimic that of wind turbines.  Titles an
d abstracts of identified papers were read to 
make a first pass determination of whether the pape
r was a study on effects in mammals or might 
contain relevant references to other relevant studi
es.  The searches yielded several studies, many 
of which were not peer-reviewed, were not whole-ani
mal mammalian or were not experimental, 
but were reviews in which animal studies were menti
oned or experiments conducted in dissected 
cochlea.  The literature review yielded eight peer-
reviewed studies, all relying on the laboratory

 rat as the model.  The studies fall into two groups
Šthose conducted in the 1970™s and early 
1980™s and those conducted in 2007Œ2010.  The most 
recent studies are conducted in China and 
are funded by the National Natural Science Foundati
on of China.  Table AG.1 (in Appendix G) 
provides a summary of the studies.  
There is no general agreement about the specific bi
ological activity of infrasound on 
rodents, although at high doses it appears to negat
ively affect the cardiovascular, brain, and 
respiratory systems (Sienkiewicz, 2007).  Early stu
dies lacked the ability to document the doses 
of infrasound given the rats, did not report genera
l pathologies associated with the exposures and 
lacked suitable controls.  Since then, researchers 
have focused on the brain and cardiac systems 
as sensitive targets of infrasound.  Experimental c
onditions in these studies lack a documented 
rationale for the selection and the use of infrasou
nd of 5-15 Hz at 130 dB.  While this appears to 
be standard practice, the relevance of these freque
ncies and pressures is unclearŠboth to the rat 
and more importantly to the human.  The exposures a
re acuteŠshort-term, high dose.  
Researchers do not document rat behaviors (includin
g startle responses), pathologies, frank 
toxicities, and outcomes due to these exposures.  T
herefore, interpretation of all of the animal 
model data for infrasound outcomes must be with the
 lens of any high-dose, short-term exposure 
in toxicology, specifically questioning whether the
 observations are readily translatable to low-
dose, chronic exposures. 
Pei et al., (2007 and 2009) examine changes in card
iac ultrastructure and function in adult 
male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 5 Hz at 130 dB 
for 2 hours for 1, 7, or 14 successive days. 
Cardiomyocytes were enzymatically isolated from the
 adult left ventricular hearts after sacrifice.  
Whole cell patch-clamp techniques were employed to 
measure whole cell L-Type Ca
2+
 currents.  
The objective of these studies was to determine whe
ther there was a cumulative effect of insult 
as measured by influx of calcium into cardiomyocyte
s.  After infrasound exposure, rats in the 7Œ 
and 14Œday exposure groups demonstrated statistical
ly significant changes in intracellular Ca
2+ 
homeostasis in cardiomyocytes as demonstrated by el
ectrochemical stimulation of the cells, 
molecular identification of specific heart-protein 
levels, and calcium transport measurements.  
Several studies examine the effects of infrasound o
n behavioral performance in rats.  The 
first of these studies was conducted under primitiv
e acoustic conditions compared with those of 
today (Petounis et al., 1977).  In this study the r
esearchers examined the behavior of adult female 
rats (undisclosed strain) exposed to increasing inf
rasound (2 Hz, 104 dB; 7 Hz, 122 dB; and 16 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
41 
| Page
 Hz, 124 dB) for increasing time (5-minute increment
s for up to 120 minutes).  Decreased activity 
levels (sleeping more) and exploratory behavior wer
e documented as dose and duration of 
exposure increased.  The authors fail to mention th
at frank toxicity including pain is associated 
with these behaviors, raising the question of relev
ance of high dose exposures.  In response to 
this and similar studies that identify increase in 
sleep, increase in avoidance behaviors and 
suppression of locomotor activity,  Spyraki et al.,
 (1977) hypothesized that these responses are 
mediated by norepinephrine levels in the brain and 
as such, exposed adult male Wistar rats to 
increasing doses of infrasound for one hour.  Using
 homogenized brain tissue, norepinephrine 
concentrations were measured using fluorometric met
hods.  Researchers demonstrated a dose-
dependent decrease in norepinephrine levels in brai
n tissue from infrasound-treated rats, 
beginning at a dose of 7 Hz and 122 dB for one hour
.  No observations of frank toxicity were 
recorded.  Liu et al., (2010) hypothesized that sin
ce infrasound could affect the brain, it 
potentially could increase cell proliferation (neur
ogenesis) in the dentate gyrus of the rat 
hippocampus, specifically a region that continues t
o generate new neurons in the adult male 
Sprague-Dawley rat.  Using a slightly longer exposu
re period of 2 hours/day for 7 days at 16 Hz 
and 130 dB, the data suggest that infrasound exposu
re inhibits cell proliferation in the dentate 
gyrus, yet has no affect on early migration and dif
ferentiation.  This study lacks suitable positive 
and negative controls that allow these conclusions 
to be drawn.  
Several unpublished or non-peer reviewed studies re
ported behavioral responses as 
relevant endpoints of infrasound exposure.  These d
ata are not discussed, yet are the basis for 
several recent studies.  In one more recent peer-re
viewed behavioral rat study, adult male Wistar 
rats were classified as ﬁsuperior enduranceﬂ and th
ose as ﬁinferior enduranceﬂ using the Rota-rod 
Treadmill (Yamamura et al., 1990).  A range of freq
uencies and pressures were used to expose 
the rats for 60Š150 minutes.  Comparison of the pre
-exposure endurance time on the Rota-Rod 
Treadmill with endurance after exposure to infrasou
nd showed that the endurance time of the 
superior group after exposure to 16 Hz, 105 dB was 
not reduced.  The endurance of the inferior 
group was reduced by exposure to 16 Hz, 105 dB afte
r 10 minutes, to 16 Hz, 95 dB after 70 
minutes, and to 16 Hz, 85 dB after 150 minutes.  Of
 most relevance is the identification of a 
subset of rats that may be more responsive to infra
sound due to their genetic makeup.  There has 
been no follow-up regarding intra-strain susceptibi
lity since this study. 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

 More recent studies have focused on the mechanisms 
by which infrasound may disrupt 
normal brain function.  As stated above, the infras
ound exposures are acuteŠshort-term, high 
dose.  At the very least, researchers should docume
nt rat behaviors, pathologies, frank toxicities, 
and outcomes due to these high dose exposures in ad
dition to measuring specific subcellular 
effects. 
Some of the biological stress literature suggests t
hat microglial activation can occur with 
heightened stress, but it appears to be short-lived
 and transitory affecting the autonomic nervous 
system and neuroendocrine system, resulting in mult
iple reported effects. To investigate the 
effect of infrasound on hippocampus-dependent learn
ing and memory, Yuan et al. (2009) 
measure cognitive abilities and activation of molec
ular signaling pathways in order to determine 
the role of the neuronal signaling transduction pat
hway, BDNF-TRkB, in infrasound-induced 
impairment of memory and learning in the rat.  Adul
t male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 
infrasound of 16 Hz and 130 dB for 2 hours daily fo
r 14 days. The acoustic conditions appeared 
to be well monitored and documented.  The Morris wa
ter maze was used to determine spatial 
learning and retention, and molecular techniques we
re used to measure cell proliferation and 
concentrations of signaling pathway proteins.  Usin
g these semi-quantitative methods, rats 
exposed to infrasound demonstrated impaired hippoca
mpal-dependent spatial learning 
acquisition and retention performance in the maze s
cheme compared with unexposed control 
rats, demonstrable downregulation of the BDNF-TRkB 
pathway, and decreased BrdU-labeled 
cell proliferation in the dentatel gyrus.   
In another study, Du et al. (2010) hypothesize that
 microglial cells may be responsible for 
infrasound-induced stress.  To test this hypothesis
, 60 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
exposed in an infrasonic chamber to 16 Hz at 130 dB
 for 2 hours.  Brains were removed and 
sectioned and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucl
eus (PVN) examined.  Primary microglial 
cells were isolated from whole brains of neonatal r
ats and grown in culture before they were 
exposed to infrasound under the same conditions as 
the whole animals.  Molecular methods were 
used to identify the presence and levels of protein
s indicative of biological stress (corticotrophin-
releasing hormone (CRH) and corticotrophin-releasin
g hormone receptor (CRH type 1 receptor) 
in areas of the brain that control the stress respo
nse.  Specifically, studies were done to determine 
whether microglial cells are involved in infrasound
-response, changes in microglial activation, 
and CRH-R1 expression in vivo in the PVN and in vit
ro at time points after the two-hour

 infrasound exposure.  The data show that the exposu
res resulted in microglial activation, 
beginning at 0.5 hours post exposure, and up-regula
tion of CRH-R1 expression.  The magnitude 
of the response increased significantly from the co
ntrol to 6 hours post exposure, returning to 
control levels, generally by 24 hours post-exposure
.  This study is well controlled, and while it 
does rely on a specific antagonist for dissecting t
he relative involvement of the neurons and the 
microglial cells, the data suggest that infrasound 
as administered in this study to rats can activate 
microglial cells, suggesting a possible mechanism f
or infrasound-induced ﬂstressﬂ or nuisance at 
a physical level (i.e., proinflammatory cytokines c
ausing sickness response behaviors).  
In summary, there are no studies in which laborator
y animals are subjected to exposures 
that mimic wind turbines.  There is insufficient ev
idence from laboratory animal studies of 
effects of low frequency noise on the respiratory s
ystem.  There is limited evidence that rats are a 
robust model for human infrasound exposure and effe
cts.  The reader is referred to Appendix G 
for specific study conditions.  In any case, the in
frasound levels and exposure conditions to 
which the rodents are exposed are adequate to cause
 pain to the rodents.  When exposed to these 
levels of infrasound, there is some evidence of rev
ersible molecular effects including short-lived 
biochemical alterations in cardiac and brain cells,
 suggesting a possible mechanism for high-
dose, infrasound-induced effects in rats.

 Health Impact Claims Associated with Noise and Vibr
ation Exposure 
The popular media contain a large number of article
s that claim the noise and vibration 
from wind turbines adversely affect human health.  
In this section the Panel examines the 
physical and biological basis for these assertions.
  Additionally, the scientific articles from which 
these assertions are made are examined in light of 
the methods used and their limitations.   
Pierpont (2009) has been cited as offering evidence
 of the physical effects of ILFN, 
referring to ﬁWind Turbine Syndromeﬂ and its impact
 on the vestibular systemŠby disturbed 
sensory input to eyes, inner ears, and stretch and 
pressure receptors in a variety of body 
locations.  The basis for the syndrome relies on da
ta from research carried out for reasons (e.g., 
space missions) other than assessment of wind turbi
nes on health.  Such research can be valuable 
to understanding new conditions, however, when the 
presentation of data is incomplete, it can 
lead to inaccurate conclusions.  A few such cases a
re mentioned here: 
Pierpont (2009) notes that von Dirke and Parker (19
94) show that the abdominal area 
resonates between 4 and 6 Hz and that wind turbines
 can produce infrasound within this range 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
44 
| Page
 (due to the blade rotation rate).  However, the von
 Dirke paper states that our bodies have 
evolved to be tolerant of the 4Œ6 Hz abdominal moti
on range: this range coincides with jogging 
and running.  The paper also reveals that motion si
ckness (which was the focus of the study) only 
occurred when the vibrations to which people were s
ubjected were between 0.01 and 0.5 Hz.  
The study exposed people to vibration from positive
 to negative 1 G forces.  Subjects were also 
rotated around various axes to achieve the vibratio
n levels and frequencies of interest in the 
study.  Interpretation of these data may allow one 
to conclude that while the abdominal area has 
a resonance in a region at which there is infrasoun
d being emitted by wind turbines, there will be 
no impact.  Further, the infrasound emitted by wind
 turbines in the range of frequencies at which 
subjects did note motion sickness is orders of magn
itude less than the level that induced motion 
sickness (see Table 2).  So while a connection is m
ade, the evidence at this point is not sufficient 
to draw a conclusion that a person™s abdominal area
 or stretch point can be excited by turbine 
infrasound.  If it were, this might lead to symptom
s of motion sickness.  
Pierpont (2009) points to a study by Todd et al. (2
008) as potential proof that the inner 
ear may be playing a role in creating the symptoms 
of ﬁWind Turbine Syndrome.ﬂ  Todd et al. 
(2008) show that the vestibular system shows a best
 frequency response around 100 Hz.  This is 
a fact, but again it is unclear how it relates to l
ow frequency noise from wind turbines.  The best 
frequency response was assessed by moving subjects™
 heads (knocking the side of the head) in a 
very specific direction because the portion of the 
inner ear that is being discussed acts as a 
gravitational sensor or an accelerometer; therefore
, it responds to motion.  A physical mechanism 
by which the audible sound produced by a wind turbi
ne at 100 Hz would couple to the human 
body in a way to create the necessary motion to whi
ch this portion of the inner ear would 
respond is unknown.  
More recently, Salt and Hullar (2010) have looked f
or something physical about the ear 
that could be responding to infrasonic frequencies.
  They describe how the outer (OHC) and 
inner (IHC) hair cells of the cochlea respond to di
fferent types of stimuli: the IHC responding to 
velocity and OHC responding to displacement.  They 
discuss how the OHC respond to lower 
frequencies than the IHC, and how the OHC acts as a
n amplifier for the IHC.  They state that it is 
known that low frequencies present in a sound signa
l can mask the higher frequenciesŠ
presumably because the OHC is not amplifying the hi
gher frequency correctly when the OHC is 
responding to low frequency disturbances.  However,
 they emphatically state that ﬁalthough 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
45 
| Page
 vestibular hair cells are maximally sensitive to lo
w frequencies they typically do not respond to 
airborne infrasound.  Rather, they normally respond
 to mechanical inputs resulting from head 
movements and positional changes with their output 
controlling muscle reflexes to maintain 
posture and eye position.ﬂ  It is completely unknow
n how the very few neural paths from the 
OHC to the brain respond, if they do at all (95% of
 the connections are between the IHC and the 
brain).  So at this moment, inner ear experts have 
not found a method for airborne infrasound to 
impact the inner ear.  The potential exists such th
at the OHC respond to infrasound, but that the 
functional role of the connection between the OHC a
nd the brain remains unknown.  Further, the 
modulation of the sound received at the IHC itself 
has not been shown to cause nausea, 
headaches, or dizziness.    
In the discussion of amplitude-modulated noise, it 
was already noted that wind turbines 
produce audible sound in the low frequency regime (
20Œ200Hz).  It has been shown that the 
sound levels in this range from some turbines are a
bove the levels for which subjects in a Korean 
study have complained of psychological effects (Jun
g & Cheung, 2008).  O™Neal (2011) also 
shows that the sound pressure level for frequencies
 between 30 and 200 Hz from two modern 
wind turbines at roughly 310 m are above the thresh
old of hearing but below the criterion for 
creating window rattle or other perceptible vibrati
ons.  The issue of vibration is discussed more 
in the next section.  It is noted that the amplitud
e-modulated noise is most likely at the heart of 
annoyance complaints.  In addition, amplitude-modul
ated noise may be a source of sleep 
disturbance noted by survey respondents.  However, 
direct health impacts have not been 
demonstrated.  

3.6.a Vibration 
Vibroacoustics disease (VAD) has been identified as
 a potential health impact of wind 
turbines in the Pierpont book.  Most of the literat
ure around VAD is attributed to Branco and 
Alves-Pereira.  Related citations attributed to Tak
ahashi (2001), Hedge and Rasmussen (1982) 
though are also provided.  These studies all requir
ed very clear coupling to large vibration 
sources such as jackhammers and heavy equipment.  T
he latter references focus on high levels of 
low frequency vibrations and noise.  In particular,
 Rasmussen studied the response of people to 
vibrating floors and chairs.  The vibration displac
ements in the study were on the order of 0.01 
cm (or 1000 times larger than the motion found 100 
m from a wind farm in a seismic study 
(Styles et al., 2005).  Takahashi used loud speaker
s placed 2 m from subjects™ bodies, only

 testing audible frequencies 20Œ50 Hz, using pressur
e levels on the order of 100Œ110 dB (roughly 
30 dB higher than any sound measured from a wind tu
rbine in this frequency range) to induce 
vibrations at various points on the body.  The Hedg
e source is not a study but a bulleted list of 
points that seem to go along with a lecture in an e
rgonomics class for which no citations are 
provided.  Branco™s work is slightly different in t
hat she considered very long-term exposures to 
moderately intense vibration inputs.  While there m
ay be possible connection to wind turbines, at 
present, the connection is not substantiated given 
the very low levels of vibration and airborne 
ILFN that have been measured from wind turbines.  
While vibroacoustic disease may not be substantiate
d, vibration levels that lead to 
annoyance or feelings of uneasiness may be more pla
usible.   Evidence for these responses is 
discussed below. 
Pierpont refers to a paper by Findeis and Peters (2
004).  This reference describes a 
situation in Germany where complaints of disturbing
 sound and vibration were investigated 
through the measurement of the vibration and acoust
ics within the dwelling, noting that people 
complained about vibrations that were not audible. 
 The one figure provided in the text shows 
that people were disturbed by what was determined t
o be structure-borne sound that was radiated 
by walls and floors at levels equivalent to 65 dB a
t 10 Hz and 40 dB at 100 Hz.  The 10 Hz level 
is just below audible.  The level reported at 100 H
z, however, is just above the hearing threshold.  
The authors concluded that the disturbances were du
e to a component of the HVAC system that 
coupled directly to the building.    
The Findeis and Peters (2004), report is reminiscen
t of papers related to investigations of 
ﬁhauntedﬂ spaces (Tandy, 1998, 1999).  In these stu
dies room frequencies around 18 Hz were 
found.  The studies hypothesized that apparitions w
ere the result of eye vibrations (the eye is 
sensitive to 18 Hz) induced by the room vibration f
ield.  In one of these studies, a ceiling fan was 
found to be the source of the vibration.  In the ot
her, the source was not identified. 
When the source was identified in the previously me
ntioned studies, there appears to be 
an obvious physical coupling mechanism.  In other s
ituations it has been estimated that airborne 
disturbances have influenced structures.  A NASA re
port from 1982 gives a figure that estimates 
the necessary sound pressure level at various frequ
encies to force vibrations in windows, walls, 
and floors of typical buildings (Stephens, 1982).  
The figure on page 14 of that report shows 
infrasound levels of 70Œ80 dB can induce wall and f
loor vibrations.  On page 39 the report also 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
47 
| Page
 shows some floor vibration levels that were associa
ted with a wind turbine.  On the graph these 
were the lowest levels of vibration when compared t
o vibrations from aircraft noise and sonic 
booms.  Another figure on page 43 shows vibrations 
and perception across the infrasonic 
frequency range.  Again, wind turbine data are show
n, and they are below the perception line.  
A second technical report (Kelley, 1985) from that 
timeframe describes disturbances 
from the MOD-1 wind turbine in Boone, North Carolin
a.  This was a downwind turbine mounted 
on a truss tower.  Out of 1000 homes within about 2
 km, 10 homes experienced room vibrations 
under certain wind conditions.  A careful measureme
nt campaign showed that indeed these few 
homes had room vibrations related to the impulsive 
noise unique to downwind turbines.  The 
report contains several findings including the foll
owing:  1) the disturbances inside the homes 
were linked to the impulsive sound generated by the
 turbine (due to tower wake/blade 
interaction) and not seismic waves, 2) the impulsiv
e signal was feeding energy into the 
vibrational modes of the rooms, floors, and walls w
here the floor/wall modes were the only 
modes in the infrasonic range, 3) people felt the d
isturbance more than they heard it, 4) peak 
vibration values were measured in the frequency ran
ge 10Œ20 Hz (floor/wall resonances) and it 
was deduced that the wall facing the turbine was be
ing excited, 5) the fact that only 10 homes 
out of 1000 (scattered in various directions around
 the turbine) were affected was shown to be 
related to complicated sound propagation paths, and
 6) while the shape of the impulse itself was 
given much attention and was shown to be a driving 
force in the coupling to the structural 
vibrations, comments were made in the report to the
 effect that nonimpulsive signals with energy 
at the right frequency could couple into the struct
ure.  The report describes a situation in Oregon 
where resonances in the flow through an exhaust sta
ck of a gas-run turbine plant had an 
associated slow modulation of the sound leading to 
annoyance near the plant.  Again it was 
found that structural modes in nearby homes were be
ing excited but this time by an acoustic field 
that was not impulsive in nature.  This is an impor
tant point because modern wind turbines do 
not create impulsive noise with strong content arou
nd 20 Hz like the downwind turbine in North 
Carolina.  Instead, they generate amplitude-modulat
ed sound around 1 kHz as well as broadband 
infrasound (van den Berg, 2004).  The broadband inf
rasound that also existed for the North 
Carolina turbine was not shown to be responsible fo
r the disturbances.  As well, the amplitude-
modulated noise that existed was not shown to be re
sponsible for the disturbances.  So, while 
there are comparisons made to the gas turbine power
 plant and to the HVAC system component 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

 where the impulsiveness of the sound was not the sa
me, direct comment on the effect of modern 
turbines on the vibration of homes is not possible.
     
A recent paper by Bolin et al. (2011), surveys much
 of the low frequency literature 
pertinent to modern wind turbines and notes that al
l measurements of indoor and outdoor levels 
of sound simultaneously do not show the same amplif
ication and ringing of frequencies 
associated with structural resonances similar to wh
at was found in North Carolina.  Instead the 
sound inside is normally less than the sound outsid
e the structure.  Bolin et al. (2011) note that 
measurements indicate that the indoor ILFN from win
d turbines typically comply with national 
guidelines (such as the Danish guideline for 44 dB(
A) outside a dwelling).    However, this does 
not preclude a situation where levels would be foun
d to be higher than the standards.  They 
propose that further investigations of an individua
l dwelling should be conducted if the measured 
difference between C-weighted and A-weighted sound 
pressure level of outdoor exposure is 
greater than 15 dB.  A similar criterion is noted i
n the non-peer reviewed report by Kamperman 
et al. (2008). 
Related to room vibration is window rattle.  This t
opic is described in the NASA reports, 
discussed above (Stephens, 1982) and discussed in t
he articles by Jung and Cheung (2008) and 
O™Neal (2011).  In these articles it has been noted
 that window rattle is often induced by 
vibrations between 5 and 9 Hz, and measurements fro
m wind turbines show that there can be 
enough energy in this range to induce window rattle
.  Whether the window rattle then generates 
its own sound field inside a room at an amplitude g
reat enough to disturb the human body is 
unknown.   
Seismic transmission of vibration at the North Caro
lina site was considered.  In that study 
the seismic waves were ruled out as too low of ampl
itude to induce the room vibrations that were 
generated.  Related are two sets of measurements th
at were taken near wind farms to assess the 
potential impact of seismic activity on extremely s
ensitive seismic measurement stations (Styles, 
2005, Schofield, 2010).  One study considered both 
waves traveling in the ground and the 
coupling of airborne infrasound to the ground, show
ing that the dominant source of seismic 
motion is the Rayleigh waves in the ground transmit
ted directly by the tower, and that the 
airborne infrasound is not playing a role in creati
ng measurable seismic motion.  The two reports 
indicate that at 100 meters from a wind turbine far
m (>6 turbines) the maximum motion that is 
induced is 120 nanometers (at about 1 Hz).  A nanom
eter is 10
-9
 m.  So this is 1.2 x 10
-7
 m of

 ground displacement.  Extremely sensitive measuring
 devices have been used to detect this slight 
motion.  To put the motion in perspective, the diam
eter of a human hair is on the order of 10
-6
 m.  
These findings indicate that seismic motion induced
 from one or two turbines is so small that it 
would be difficult to induce any physical or struct
ural response.    
Hessler and Hessler, (2010) reviewed various state 
noise limits and discussed them in 
connection with wind turbines.  The article contain
s a few comments related to low frequency 
noise.  It is stated that, ﬁa link between health c
omplaints and turbine noise has only been 
asserted based on what is essentially anecdotal evi
dence without any valid epidemiological 
studies or scientific proof of any kind.ﬂ  The arti
cle states that if a metric for low frequency noise
 
is needed, then a limit of 65 dB(C) could be used. 
 This proposed criterion is not flexible for use 
in different environments such as rural vs. city.  
In this sense, Bolin et als™ suggestion of 
checking for a difference between C-weighted and A-
weighted sound pressure level of outdoor 
exposure greater than 15 dB is more appropriate.  T
his value of 15 dB, was based on past 
complaints associated with combustion turbines.  Th
e Bolin article, however, also cautions that 
obtaining accurate low frequency measurements for w
ind turbines is difficult because of the 
presence of wind.  Even sophisticated windscreens c
annot eliminate the ambient low frequency 
wind noise.   
Leventhal (2006) notes that when hearing and deaf s
ubjects are tested simultaneously, the 
subjects™ chests would resonate with sounds in the 
range of 50Œ80 Hz.  However, the amplitude 
of the sound had to be 40Œ50 dB higher than the hum
an hearing threshold for the deaf subjects to 
report the chest vibration.  This leads one to conc
lude that chest resonance in isolation should not 
be associated with inaudible sound.  If a room is v
ibrating due to a structural resonance, such 
levels may be obtained.  Again, this effect has nev
er been measured associated with a modern 
wind turbine.   
The stimulation of house resonances and self-report
ed ill-effects due to a modern wind 
turbine appear in a report by independent consultan
ts that describes pressure measurements taken 
inside and outside of a home in Falmouth Massachuse
tts in the spring of 2011 (Ambrose & 
Rand, 2011).  The measurements were taken at roughl
y 500 meters from a single 1.65 MW stall-
regulated turbine when the wind speeds were relativ
ely high: 20-30 m/s at hub height. The 
authors noted feeling ill when the dB(A) levels ind
oors were between 18 and 24 (with a 
corresponding dB(G) level of 51-64).  They report t
hat they felt effects both inside and outside 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
50 
| Page
 but preferred to be outside where the dB(A) levels 
ranged from 41-46 (with corresponding dB(G) 
levels from 54-65.)  This is curious because weight
ed measurements account for human response 
and the weighted values were higher outside. Howeve
r, the actual dB(L) levels were higher 
inside.   
The authors present some data indicating that the G
-weighted value of the pressure signal 
is often greater than 60 dB(G), the averaged thresh
old value proposed by Salt and Hullar (2011) 
for OHC activation.  However, the method used to ob
tain the data is not presented, and the time 
scale over which the data are presented (< 0.015 se
conds or 66 Hz) is too short to properly 
capture the low frequency content.   
The data analysis differed from the common standard
 of practice in an attempt to 
highlight weaknesses in the standard measurement ap
proach associated with the capture of 
amplitude modulation and ILFN.  This departure from
 the standard is a useful step in defining a 
measurement technique such as that called for in a 
report by HGC Engineering (HGC, 2010), 
that notes policy making entities should ﬁconsider 
adopting or endorsing a proven measurement 
procedure that could be used to quantify noise at i
nfrasonic frequencies.ﬂ 
The measurements by Ambrose and Rand (2011) show a 
difference in A and C weighted 
outdoor sound levels of around 15 dB at the high wi
nd speeds (which is Bolin et. al.™s 
recommended value for triggering further interior i
nvestigations).  The simultaneous indoor and 
outdoor measurements indicate that at very low freq
uencies (2-6 Hz) the indoor pressure levels 
are greater than those outdoors.  It is useful to n
ote that the structural forcing at the blade-
passage-frequency, the time delay and the subsequen
t ringing that was present in the Boone 
homes (Kelley, 1985) is not demonstrated by Ambrose
 and Rand (2011).  This indicates that the 
structural coupling is not forced by the amplitude 
modulation and is due to a much subtler 
process.  Importantly, while there is an amplificat
ion at these lower frequencies, the indoor levels 
(unweighted) are still far lower than any levels th
at have ever been shown to cause a physical 
response (including the activation of the OHC) in h
umans.  
The measurements did reveal a 22.9 Hz tone that was
 amplitude modulated at 
approximately the blade passage frequency.  The sou
rce of the tone was not identified, and no 
indication as to whether the tone varied with wind 
speed was provided, a useful step  to help 
determine whether the tone is aerodynamically gener
ated.  The level of this tone is shown to be 
higher than the OHC activation threshold. The 22.9 
Hz tone did not couple to the structure and 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
51

 showed the normal attenuation from outside to insid
e the structure.  In order to determine if the 
results that show potential tonal activation of the
 OHC  are generalizable, it is necessary to 
identify the source of this tone which could be uni
que to stall-regulated turbines or even unique 
to this specific brand of turbine.   
Finally, the measurements shown in the report are a
typical within the wind turbine 
measurement literature and the data analysis is not
 fully described.  Also, the report offers no 
plausible coupling mechanism of the sound waves to 
the body beyond that proposed by Salt and 
Hullar (2011).  Because of this, the results are su
ggestive but require corroboration of the 
measurements  and scientifically based mechanisms f
or human health impact. 
3.6.b Summary of Claimed Health Impacts 
In this section, the potential health impacts due t
o noise and vibration from wind turbines 
was discussed.  Both the infrasonic and low frequen
cy noise ranges were considered.  Assertions 
that infrasound and low frequency noise from turbin
es affect the vestibular system either through 
airborne coupling to humans are not empirically sup
ported.  In the multitude of citations given in 
the popular media as to methods in which the vestib
ular system is influenced, all refer to 
situations in which there is direct vibration coupl
ing to the body or when the wave amplitudes 
are orders of magnitudes greater than those produce
d by wind turbines.  Recent research has 
found one potential path in the auditory system, th
e OHC, in which infrasound might be sensed.  
There is no evidence, however, that when the OHC se
nse infrasound, it then leads to any of the 
symptoms reported by complainants.  That the infras
ound and low frequency noise couple to 
humans through the forcing of structural vibration 
is plausible but has not been demonstrated for 
modern wind turbines.  In addition, should it be sh
own that such a coupling occurs, research 
indicates that the coupling would be transient and 
highly dependent on wind conditions and 
localized to very few homes surrounding a turbine. 
  
Seismic activity near a turbine due to vibrations t
ransmitted down the tower has been 
measured, and the levels are too low to produce vib
rations in humans. 
The audible noise from wind turbines, in particular
 the amplitude modulated trailing edge 
noise, does exist, changes level based on atmospher
ic conditions, can change character from 
swish to thump-based on atmospheric effects, and ca
n be perceived from home to home 
differently based on propagation effects.  This aud
ible sound has been noted by complainants as 
a source of annoyance and a cause for sleep disrupt
ion.  Some authors have proposed nighttime 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
52 
| Page
 noise regulations and regulations based on shorter 
time averages (vs. annual averages) as a 
means to reduce annoyance from this noise source.  
Some have conjectured that the low 
frequency content of the amplitude-modulated noise 
is responsible for the annoyance. They have 
proposed that the difference between the measured o
utdoor A- and C- weighted sound pressure 
levels could be used to identify situations in whic
h the low frequency content is playing a larger 
role.  Further, they note that this difference migh
t be used as part of a regulation as a means to 
reduce annoyance.

Findings 
Based on the detailed review of the scientific lite
rature and other available reports and 
consideration of the strength of scientific evidenc
e, the Panel presents findings relative to three 
factors associated with the operation of wind turbi
nes: noise and vibration, shadow flicker, and 
ice throw.  The findings that follow address specif
ics in each of these three areas. 
4.1 Noise 

4.1.a Production of Noise and Vibration by Wind Tur
bines 
1.
 Wind turbines can produce unwanted sound (referred 
to as noise) during operation.  The 
nature of the sound depends on the design of the wi
nd turbine.  Propagation of the sound 
is primarily a function of distance, but it can als
o be affected by the placement of the 
turbine, surrounding terrain, and atmospheric condi
tions.  
a.
 Upwind and downwind turbines have different sound c
haracteristics, primarily 
due to the interaction of the blades with the zone 
of reduced wind speed behind 
the tower in the case of downwind turbines.  
b.
 Stall regulated and pitch controlled turbines exhib
it differences in their 
dependence of noise generation on the wind speed 
c.
 Propagation of sound is affected by refraction of s
ound due to temperature 
gradients, reflection from hillsides, and atmospher
ic absorption.  Propagation 
effects have been shown to lead to different experi
ences of noise by neighbors.  
d.
 The audible, amplitude-modulated noise from wind tu
rbines (ﬁwhooshingﬂ) is 
perceived to increase in intensity at night (and so
metimes becomes more of a 
ﬁthumpingﬂ) due to multiple effects:  i) a stable a
tmosphere will have larger wind 
gradients, ii) a stable atmosphere may refract the 
sound downwards instead of 
upwards, iii) the ambient noise near the ground is 
lower both because of the stable 
atmosphere and because human generated noise is oft
en lower at night. 
2.
 The sound power level of a typical modern utility s
cale wind turbine is on the order of 
103 dB(A), but can be somewhat higher or lower depe
nding on the details of the design 
and the rated power of the turbine.  The perceived 
sound decreases rapidly with the 
distance from the wind turbines.  Typically, at dis
tances larger than 400 m, sound 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
54 
| Page
 pressure levels for modern wind turbines are less t
han 40 dB(A), which is below the level 
associated with annoyance in the epidemiological st
udies reviewed.  
3.
 Infrasound refers to vibrations with frequencies be
low 20 Hz.  Infrasound at amplitudes 
over 100Œ110 dB can be heard and felt.  Research ha
s shown that vibrations below these 
amplitudes are not felt.  The highest infrasound le
vels that have been measured near 
turbines and reported in the literature near turbin
es are under 90 dB at 5 Hz and lower at 
higher frequencies for locations as close as 100 m.
 4.
 Infrasound from wind turbines is not related to nor
 does it cause a ﬁcontinuous 
whooshing.ﬂ 
5.  Pressure waves at any frequency (audible or inf
rasonic) can cause vibration in another 
structure or substance.  In order for vibration to 
occur, the amplitude (height) of the wave 
has to be high enough, and only structures or subst
ances that have the ability to receive 
the wave (resonant frequency) will vibrate.  
 4.1.b Health Impacts of Noise and Vibration 
1.
 Most epidemiologic literature on human response to 
wind turbines relates to self-reported 
ﬁannoyance,ﬂ and this response appears to be a func
tion of some combination of the 
sound itself, the sight of the turbine, and attitud
e towards the wind turbine project. 
a.
 There is limited epidemiologic evidence suggesting 
an association between 
exposure to wind turbines and annoyance. 
b.
 There is insufficient epidemiologic evidence to det
ermine whether there is an 
association between noise from wind turbines and an
noyance independent from 
the effects of seeing a wind turbine and vice versa
. 
2.
 There is limited evidence from epidemiologic studie
s suggesting an association between 
noise from wind turbines and sleep disruption.  In 
other words, it is possible that noise 
from some wind turbines can cause sleep disruption.
  
3.
 A very loud wind turbine could cause disrupted slee
p, particularly in vulnerable 
populations, at a certain distance, while a very qu
iet wind turbine would not likely disrupt 
even the lightest of sleepers at that same distance
.  But there is not enough evidence to 
  WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
55 
| Page
 provide particular sound-pressure thresholds at whi
ch wind turbines cause sleep 
disruption.  Further study would provide these leve
ls.  
4.
 Whether annoyance from wind turbines leads to sleep
 issues or stress has not been 
sufficiently quantified.  While not based on eviden
ce of wind turbines, there is evidence 
that sleep disruption can adversely affect mood, co
gnitive functioning, and overall sense 
of health and well-being. 
5.
 There is insufficient evidence that the noise from 
wind turbines is 
directly (i.e., 
independent from an effect on annoyance or sleep) 
causing health problems or disease.  
6.
 Claims that infrasound from wind turbines directly 
impacts the vestibular system have 
not been demonstrated scientifically.  Available ev
idence shows that the infrasound levels 
near wind turbines cannot impact the vestibular sys
tem.   
a.
 The measured levels of infrasound produced by moder
n upwind wind turbines at 
distances as close as 68 m are well below that requ
ired for non-auditory 
perception (feeling of vibration in parts of the bo
dy, pressure in the chest, etc.).  
b.
 If infrasound couples into structures, then people 
inside the structure could feel a 
vibration.  Such structural vibrations have been sh
own in other applications to 
lead to feelings of uneasiness and general annoyanc
e.  The measurements have 
shown no evidence of such coupling from modern upwi
nd turbines. 
c.
 Seismic (ground-carried) measurements recorded near
 wind turbines and wind 
turbine farms are unlikely to couple into structure
s.  
d.
 A possible coupling mechanism between infrasound an
d the vestibular system 
(via the Outer Hair Cells (OHC) in the inner ear) h
as been proposed
 but is not yet 
fully understood or sufficiently explained.  Levels
 of infrasound near wind 
turbines have been shown to be high enough to
 be sensed by the OHC.  However, 
evidence does not exist to demonstrate the influenc
e of wind turbine-generated 
infrasound on vestibular-mediated effects
 in the brain.
 e.
 Limited evidence from rodent (rat) laboratory studi
es identifies short-lived 
biochemical alterations in cardiac and brain cells 
in response to short exposures to 
emissions at 16 Hz and 130 dB.  These levels exceed
 measured infrasound levels 
from modern turbines by over 35 dB.  

  WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

 7.
 There is no evidence for a set of health effects, f
rom exposure to wind turbines, that could 
be characterized as a "Wind Turbine Syndrome." 
8.
 The strongest epidemiological study suggests that t
here is not an association between 
noise from wind turbines and measures of psychologi
cal distress or mental health 
problems.
  
There were two smaller, weaker, studies: one did no
te an association, one did 
not.  Therefore, we conclude the weight of the evid
ence suggests no association between 
noise from wind turbines and measures of psychologi
cal distress or mental health 
problems
. 9.
 None of the limited epidemiological evidence review
ed suggests an association between 
noise from wind turbines and pain and stiffness, di
abetes, high blood pressure, tinnitus, 
hearing impairment, cardiovascular disease, and hea
dache/migraine. 
4.2 Shadow Flicker 

4.2.a Production of Shadow Flicker 
Shadow flicker results from the passage of the blad
es of a rotating wind turbine between 
the sun and the observer.   
1.
 The occurrence of shadow flicker depends on the loc
ation of the observer relative to the 
turbine and the time of day and year. 
2.
 Frequencies of shadow flicker elicited from turbine
s is proportional to the rotational 
speed of the rotor times the number of blades and i
s generally between 0.5 and 1.1 Hz for 
typical larger turbines.  
3.
 Shadow flicker is only present at distances of less
 than 1400 m from the turbine. 
4.2.b Health Impacts of Shadow Flicker 
1.
 Scientific evidence suggests that shadow flicker do
es not pose a risk for eliciting seizures 
as a result of photic stimulation.  
2.
 There is limited scientific evidence of an associat
ion between annoyance from prolonged 
shadow flicker (exceeding 30 minutes per day) and p
otential transitory cognitive and 
physical health effects.

 4.3 Ice Throw 

4.3.a Production of Ice Throw 
Ice can fall or be thrown from a wind turbine durin
g or after an event when ice forms or 
accumulates on the blades.   
1.
 The distance that a piece of ice may travel from th
e turbine is a function of the wind 
speed, the operating conditions, and the shape of t
he ice.  
2.
 In most cases, ice falls within a distance from the
 turbine equal to the tower height, and in 
any case, very seldom does the distance exceed twic
e the total height of the turbine 
(tower height plus blade length). 
4.3.b Health Impacts of Ice Throw 
1.
 There is sufficient evidence that falling ice is ph
ysically harmful and measures should be 
taken to ensure that the public is not likely to en
counter such ice. 
4.4 Other Considerations 
In addition to the specific findings stated above f
or noise and vibration, shadow flicker 
and ice throw, the Panel concludes the following:  
1.
 Effective public participation in and direct benefi
ts from wind energy projects (such as 
receiving electricity from the neighboring wind tur
bines) have been shown to result in 
less annoyance in general and better public accepta
nce overall.

Best Practices Regarding Human Health Effects Of Wi
nd Turbines 
Broadly speaking, the term ﬁbest practiceﬂ refers t
o policies, guidelines, or 
recommendations that have been developed for a spec
ific situation.  Implicit in the term is that 
the practice is based on the best information avail
able at the time of its institution.  A best 
practice may be refined as more information and stu
dies become available.  The panel recognizes 
that in countries which are dependent on wind energ
y and are protective of public health, best 
practices have been developed and adopted. 
In some cases, the weight of evidence for a specifi
c practice is stronger than it is in other 
cases.  Accordingly, best practice* may be categori
zed in terms of the evidence available, as 
shown in Table 3:

 5.1 Noise 
Evidence regarding wind turbine noise and human hea
lth is limited.   There is limited 
evidence of an association between wind turbine noi
se and both annoyance and sleep disruption, 
depending on the sound pressure level at the locati
on of concern.  However, there are no 
research-based sound pressure levels that correspon
d to human responses to noise.  A number of 
countries that have more experience with wind energ
y and are protective of public health have 
developed guidelines to minimize the possible adver
se effects of noise.  These guidelines 
consider time of day, land use, and ambient wind sp
eed.  Table 4 summarizes the guidelines of 
Germany (in the categories of industrial, commercia
l and villages) and Denmark (in the 
categories of sparsely populated and residential). 
The sound levels shown in the table are for 
nighttime and are assumed to be taken immediately o
utside of the residence or building of 
concern.  In addition, the World Health Organizatio
n recommends a maximum nighttime sound 
pressure level of 40 dB(A) in residential areas.  R
ecommended setbacks corresponding to these 
values may be calculated by software such as WindPr
o or similar software.  Such calculations 
are normally to be done as part of feasibility stud
ies.  The Panel considers the guidelines shown 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
60 
| Page
 below to be Promising Practices (Category 3) but to
 embody some aspects of Field Tested Best 
Practices (Category 2) as well.

vels by Land Use Type

Residential areas, 8 m/s wind* 39 
Residential areas, 6 m/s wind* 37 
*measured at 10 m above ground, outside of residenc
e or location of concern 
The time period over which these noise limits are m
easured or calculated also makes a 
difference.  For instance, the often-cited World He
alth Organization recommended nighttime 
noise cap of 40 dB(A) is averaged over one year (an
d does not refer specifically to wind turbine 
noise).  Denmark™s noise limits in the table above 
are calculated over a 10-minute period.  These 
limits are in line with the noise levels that the e
pidemiological studies connect with insignificant 
reports of annoyance.  
The Panel recommends that noise limits such as thos
e presented in the table above be 
included as part of a statewide policy regarding ne
w wind turbine installations.  In addition, 
suitable ranges and procedures for cases when the n
oise levels may be greater than those values 
should also be considered.  The considerations shou
ld take into account trade-offs between 
environmental and health impacts of different energ
y sources, national and state goals for energy 
independence, potential extent of impacts, etc.   
The Panel also recommends that those involved in a 
wind turbine purchase become 
familiar with the noise specifications for the turb
ine and factors that affect noise production and 
noise control.  Stall and pitch regulated turbines 
have different noise characteristics, especially in
 
high winds.  For certain turbines, it is possible t
o decrease noise at night through suitable control 
measures (e.g., reducing the rotational speed of th
e rotor).  If noise control measures are to be 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
61 
| Page
 considered, the wind turbine manufacturer must be a
ble to demonstrate that such control is 
possible.  
The Panel recommends an ongoing program of monitori
ng and evaluating the sound 
produced by wind turbines that are installed in the
 Commonwealth.  IEC 61400-11 provides the 
standard for making noise measurements of wind turb
ines (International Electrotechnical 
Commission, 2002).  In general, more comprehensive 
assessment of wind turbine noise in 
populated areas is recommended.  These assessments 
should be done with reference to the 
broader ongoing research in wind turbine noise prod
uction and its effects, which is taking place 
internationally.  Such assessments would be useful 
for refining siting guidelines and for 
developing best practices of a higher category. Clo
ser investigation near homes where outdoor 
measurements show A and C weighting differences of 
greater than 15 dB is recommended.   
5.2 Shadow Flicker 
Based on the scientific evidence and field experien
ce related to shadow flicker, Germany has 
adopted guidelines that specify the following: 
1.
 Shadow flicker should be calculated based on the as
tronomical maximum values (i.e., not 
considering the effect of cloud cover, etc.).   
2.
 Commercial software such as WindPro or similar soft
ware may be used for these 
calculations.  Such calculations should be done as 
part of feasibility studies for new wind 
turbines. 
3.
 Shadow flicker should not occur more than 30 minute
s per day and not more than 30 
hours per year at the point of concern (e.g., resid
ences).   
4.
 Shadow flicker can be kept to acceptable levels eit
her by setback or by control of the 
wind turbine.  In the latter case, the wind turbine
 manufacturer must be able to 
demonstrate that such control is possible. 

The guidelines summarized above may be considered t
o be a Field Tested Best Practice 
(Category 2).  Additional studies could be performe
d, specifically regarding the number of hours 
per year that shadow flicker should be allowed, tha
t would allow them to be placed in Research 
Validated (Category 1) Best Practices.

 5.3 Ice Throw 
Ice falling from a wind turbine could pose a danger
 to human health.  It is also clear that 
the danger is limited to those times when icing occ
urs and is limited to relatively close proximity 
to the wind turbine.  Accordingly, the following sh
ould be considered Category 1 Best Practices. 
1.
 In areas where icing events are possible, warnings 
should be posted so that no one passes 
underneath a wind turbine during an icing event and
 until the ice has been shed.   
2.
 Activities in the vicinity of a wind turbine should
 be restricted during and immediately 
after icing events in consideration of the followin
g two limits (in meters).   
For a turbine that may not have ice control measure
s, it may be assumed that ice could 
fall within the following limit: 
()HRxthrow
+=25.1
max,
Where: 
R = rotor radius (m), 
H = hub height (m) 
 
For ice falling from a stationary turbine, the foll
owing limit should be used: 
()15/
max,
HRUxfall
+=Where: 
U = maximum likely wind speed (m/s) 
The choice of maximum likely wind speed should be t
he expected one-year return 
maximum, found in accordance to the International E
lectrotechnical Commission™s design 
standard for wind turbines, IEC 61400-1. 
Danger from falling ice may also be limited by ice 
control measures.  If ice control 
measures are to be considered, the wind turbine man
ufacturer must be able to demonstrate that 
such control is possible. 

5.4 Public Participation/Annoyance 
There is some evidence of an association between pa
rticipation, economic or otherwise, 
in a wind turbine project and the annoyance (or lac
k thereof) that affected individuals may 
express.  Accordingly, measures taken to directly i
nvolve residents who live in close proximity 
to a wind turbine project may also serve to reduce 
the level of annoyance.  Such measures may 
be considered to be a Promising Practice (Category 
3).   
5.5 Regulations/Incentives/Public Education 
The evidence indicates that in those parts of the w
orld where there are a significant 
number of wind turbines in relatively close proximi
ty to where people live, there is a close 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
63 
| Page
 coupling between the development of guidelines, pro
vision of incentives, and educating the 
public.  The Panel suggests that the public be enga
ged through such strategies as education, 
incentives for community-owned wind developments, c
ompensations to those experiencing 
documented loss of property values, comprehensive s
etback guidelines, and public education 
related to renewable energy.  These multi-faceted a
pproaches may be considered to be a 
Promising Practice (Category 3).

 Appendix A:  
 Wind Turbines - Introduction to Wind Energy 
Although wind energy for bulk supply of electricity
 is a relatively new technology, the 
historical precedents for it go back a long way.  T
hey are descendents of mechanical windmills 
that first appeared in Persia as early as the 7
th
 century (Vowles, 1932) and then re-appeared in 
northern Europe in the Middle Ages.  They were cons
iderably developed during the 18
th
 and 19
th
 centuries, and then formed the basis for the first 
electricity generating wind turbine in the late 
19
th
 century.  Development continued sporadically throu
gh the mid 20
th
 century, with modern 
turbines beginning to emerge in the 1970™s.  It was
 the introduction of other technologies, such 
as electronics, computers, control theory, composit
e materials, and computer-based simulation 
capability that led to the successful development o
f the large scale, autonomously operating wind 
turbines that have become so widely deployed over t
he past twenty years. 
The wind is the most important external factor in w
ind energy.  It can be thought of as the 
ﬁfuelﬂ of the wind turbine, even though it is not c
onsumed in the process.  The wind determines 
the amount of energy that is produced, and is there
fore referred to as the resource.  The wind 
resource can vary significantly, depending on the l
ocation and the nature of the surface.  In the 
United States, the Great Plains have a relatively e
nergetic wind resource.  In Massachusetts, 
winds tend to be relatively low inland, except for 
mountaintops and ridges.  The winds tend to be 
higher close to the coast and then increase offshor
e.  Average offshore wind speeds generally 
increase with distance from shore as well.  The win
d resource of Massachusetts is illustrated in

)  This section summarizes the basic characteristics o
f the wind in so far as they relate to 
wind turbine power production.  Much more detail on
 this topic is provided in (Manwell et al., 
2009).  The wind will also affect the design of the
 wind turbines, and for this purpose it is 
referred to as an ﬁexternal design condition.ﬂ  Thi
s aspect of the wind is discussed in more detail 
in a later section.  

 
   WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

 AA.1 Origin of the Wind 
The wind originates from sunlight due to the differ
ential heating of various parts of the 
earth. This differential heating produces zones of 
high and low pressure, resulting in air 
movement. The motion of the air is also affected by
 earth™s rotation.  Considerations regarding 
the wind insofar as it relates to wind turbine oper
ation include the following: (i) the winds aloft 
(geostrophic wind), (ii) atmospheric boundary layer
 meteorology, (iii) the variation of wind 
speed with height, (iv) surface roughness, and (v) 
turbulence. 
The geostrophic wind is the wind in the upper atmos
phere, which results from the 
combined effects of the pressure gradient and the e
arth™s rotation (via the Coriolis force).  The 
gradient wind can be thought of as an extension of 
the geostrophic wind,
˛
difference in this 
case being that centrifugal effects are included.  
These result from curved isobars (lines of 
constant pressure) in the atmosphere.  It is these 
upper atmosphere winds that are the source of 
most of the energy that eventually impinges on wind
 turbines.  The energy in the upper 
atmosphere is transferred down closer to the surfac
e via a variety of mechanisms, most notably 
turbulence, which is generated mechanically (via su
rface roughness) and thermally (via the rising 
of warm air and falling of cooler air).   
Although driven by higher altitude winds, the wind 
near the surface is affected by the 
surrounding topography (such as mountains and ridge
s) and surface conditions (such as tree 
cover or presence of buildings).   

AA.2 Variability of the Wind 
One of the singular characteristics of the wind is 
its variability, both temporal and spatial.  
The temporal variability includes: (i) short term (
gusts and turbulence), (ii) moderately short 
term (e.g., hr to hr means), (iii) diurnal (variati
ons over a day), (iv) seasonal, and (v) inter-annua
l 
(year to year).  The wind may vary spatially as wel
l, both from one location to another or with 
height above ground.

 Figure AA.2 illustrates the variability of the hour
ly average wind speeds for one year at one 
location. 
       Figure AA.2:  Typical hourly wind speeds ove
r a year 

As can be seen, the hourly average wind speed in th
is example varies significantly over the year, 
ranging from zero to nearly 30 m/s. 
Figure AA.3 illustrates wind speed at another locat
ion recorded twice per second over a 
23-hour period.  There is significant variability h
ere as well.  Much of this variability in this 
figure is associated with short-term fluctuations, 
or turbulence.  Turbulence has some effect on 
power generation, but it has a more significant eff
ect on the design of wind turbines, due to the 
material fatigue that it tends to engender.  Turbul
ence is discussed in more detail in a later 
section.

 Figure AA.3:  Typical wind data, sampled at 2 Hz fo
r a 23-hr period 
In spite of the variability in the wind time series
, summary characteristics have much less 
variability.  For example, the annual mean wind spe
ed at a given location is generally within +/- 
10% of the long-term mean at that site.  Furthermor
e, the distribution of wind speeds, that is to 
say the frequency of occurrence of winds in various
 wind speed ranges, also tends to be similar 
from year.  The general shape of such distributions
 is also similar from one location to another, 
even if the means are different.  In fact, statisti
cal models such as the Weibull distribution can be 
used to model the occurrences of various wind speed
s in most locations on the earth.  For 
example, the number of occurrences of wind speed in
 various ranges from the data set illustrated 
in Figure AA.2 are shown in Figure AA.4, together w
ith the those occurrences as modeled by the 
Weibull distribution.

 AA.3 Power in the Wind 
The power available in the wind can be predicted fr
om the fundamental principles of 
fluid mechanics.  First of all, the energy per unit
 mass of a particle of air is given simply by ½ 
times the square of the velocity, 
U 
(m/s).  The mass flow rate of the air (kg/s) throug
h a given 
area 
A (m
2) perpendicular to the direction of the wind is 
AU
mr=, where 
 is the density of the 
air (kg/m
3).  The power in the wind per unit area, 
P/A
, (W/m
2) is then: 
 ()
322121//UUAmAPr== (4) 
AA.4 Wind Shear 
Wind shear is the variation of wind speed with heig
ht. Wind shear has relevance to power 
generation, to turbine design, and to noise generat
ion.  The variation of wind speed with height is 
typically modeled with a power law as follows:  
 []a1212/hhUU= (5) 
Where 
U1 = speed at reference height 
h1, 
U2 is the wind speed to be estimated at height 
h2 and 
 is the power law exponent. Values of the exponent t
ypically range from a 0.1 for smooth surfaces 
to 0.4 for very rough surfaces (such as forests or 
built-up areas.) 
Wind shear can also be affected by the stability of
 the atmosphere.  Equations have been 
developed that allow the incorporation of stability
 parameters in the analysis, but these too are 
outside the scope of this overview. 

AA.5 Wind and Wind Turbine Structural Issues 
As discussed previously, the wind is of particular 
interest in wind turbine applications, 
since it is the source of the energy. It is also th
e source of significant structural loads that the 
turbine must be able to withstand.  Some of these l
oads occur when the turbine is operating; 
others occur when it is stopped.  Extreme winds, fo
r example, are likely to affect a turbine when 
it is stopped.  High winds with sudden directional 
change during operation can also induce high 
loads. Turbulence during normal operation results i
n fatigue.  The following is a summary of the 
key aspects of the wind that affect the design of w
ind turbines.  More details may be found in 
(Manwell et al., 2009). 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

 AA.5.a Turbulence 
Turbulence in the wind can have significant effect 
on the structure of a wind turbine as 
well as its operation, and so it must be considered
 in the design process.  The term ﬁturbulenceﬂ 
refers to the short-term variations in the speed an
d direction of the wind.  It manifests itself as 
apparently random fluctuations superimposed upon a 
relatively steady mean flow. Turbulence is 
not actually random, however.  It has some very dis
tinct characteristics, at least in a statistical 
sense.  
Turbulence is characterized by a number of measures
.  These include: (i) turbulence 
intensity, (ii) turbulence probability density func
tions (pdf), (iii) autocorrelations, (iv) integral 
time scales and length scales, and (v) power spectr
al density functions.  Discussion of the 
physics of turbulence is outside the scope of this 
overview. 
AA.5.b Gusts 
A gust is discrete increase and then decrease in wi
nd speed, possibly associated with a 
change in wind direction, which can be of significa
nce to the design of a wind turbine.  Gusts are 
typically associated with turbulence. 

AA.5.c Extreme Winds 
Extreme winds need to be considered for the design 
of a wind turbine.  Extreme winds 
are normally associated with storms.  They occur re
latively rarely, but often enough that the 
possibility of their occurring cannot be ignored.  
Statistical models, such as the Gumbel 
distribution (Gumbel, 1958), are used to predict th
e likelihood of such winds occurring at least 
once every 50 or 100 years.  Such intervals are cal
led return periods. 
AA.5.d Soils 
Soils are also important for the design and install
ation of a wind turbine. In particular, the 
nature of the soil will affect the design of the wi
nd turbine foundations.  Discussion of soils is 
outside the scope of this overview. 

AA.6 Wind Turbine Aerodynamics 
The heart of the wind turbine is the rotor.  This i
s a device that extracts the kinetic energy 
from the wind and converts it into a mechanical for
m.  Below is a summary of wind turbine rotor 
aerodynamics.  More details may be found in (Manwel
l et al., 2009).  
A wind turbine rotor is comprised of blades that ar
e attached to a hub.  The hub is in turn 
attached to a shaft (the main shaft) which transfer
s the energy through the remainder of the drive 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

 train to the generator where is it converted to ele
ctricity.  The maximum power that a rotor can 
extract from the wind is first of all limited by th
e power in the wind, which passes through an 
area defined by the passage of the rotor.  At the p
resent time, most wind turbines utilize a rotor 
with a horizontal axis.  That is, the axis of rotat
ion is (nominally) parallel to the earth™s surface.
  
Accordingly, the area that is swept out by the roto
r is circular.  Assuming a rotor radius of 
R (m), 
the maximum power 
P (W) available in the wind is:  
 3221URPrp
= (6) 
Early in the 20
th
 century, it was shown by Betz (among others, see [
4]) that the maximum 
power that could be extracted was less than the pow
er in the wind; in fact, it was 16/27 times that 
value.  Betz™ work led to the definition of a power
 coefficient, 
Cp, which expresses the ratio of 
the actual power extracted by a rotor to the power 
in the wind. When considering efficiencies of 
other components in the drive train, as expressed b
y the 
, the total power out a wind turbine, 
PWT
, would be given by: 
 3221URCPpWT
rp
h= (7) 
The maximum value of the power coefficient, known a
s the Betz limit, is thus 16/27.  
Betz™ original analysis was based on the fundamenta
l principles of fluid mechanics 
including linear momentum theory.  It also included
 the following assumptions: (i) homogenous, 
incompressible, steady state fluid flow; (ii) no fr
ictional drag; (iii) a rotor with an infinite numbe
r 
of (very small) blades; (iv) uniform thrust over th
e rotor area; (v) a non-rotating wake; and (vi) 
the static pressure far upstream and far downstream
 of the rotor that is equal to the undisturbed 
ambient static pressure. 
A real rotor operating on a horizontal axis will re
sult in a rotating wake. Some of the 
energy in the wind will go into that rotation and w
ill not be available for conversion into 
mechanical power.  The result is that the maximum p
ower coefficient will actually be less than 
the Betz limit.  The derivation of the maximum powe
r coefficient for the rotating wake case use 
a number of terms: (i) the rotational speed of turb
ine rotor, 
, in radians/sec; (ii) tip speed ratio, 
 = 
R/U;
 (iii) local speed ratio, 
r = 
 r/R;
 (iv) rotational speed of wake, 
; (v) an axial 
induction factor,

ind speed at the rotor and

 Figure AA.6:  Airfoil nomenclature 
The BEM method equates the forces on the blades ass
ociated with air flowing over the 
airfoil with forces associated with the change in m
omentum of the air passing through the rotor.  
The starting point for this analysis is the assessm
ent of the lift force on an airfoil.  Lift is a for
ce 
perpendicular to the flow.  It is given by  
 221~cU
CFLLr= (9)  
Where: 
LF~ = force per unit length, N/m 
CL = lift coefficient, - 
c = chord length (distance from leading edge to trai
ling edge of airfoil, m) 
Thin airfoil theory predicts that for a very thin, 
ideal airfoil the lift coefficient is given by  
 apsin
2=LC (11)  
where 
 is the angle of attack, which is the angle between
 the flow and the chord line of the airfoil.  
The lift coefficient for real airfoils typically in
cludes a constant term but the slope, at 
least for low angles of attack, is similar to that 
for an ideal airfoil.  For greater angles of attack
 
(above 10Œ15 degrees) the lift coefficient begins t
o decrease, eventually approaching zero.  This 
is known as stall.  A typical lift coefficient vs. 
angle of attack curve is illustrated in Figure AA.7
.

 There is always some drag force associated with flu
id flow.  This is a force is in line with 
the flow.  Drag force (per unit length) is given by
: 
 221~cU
CFDDr= (12) 
Where 
CD = drag coefficient 
When designing blades for a wind turbine, it is gen
erally desired to minimize the drag to 
lift ratio at the design point.  This generally res
ults in a lift coefficient in the vicinity of 1.0 a
nd a 
drag coefficient of approximately 0.006, although t
hese values can differ depending on the 
airfoil.   
Blade element momentum theory, as noted above, rela
tes the blade shape to its 
performance.  The following approach is used.  The 
blade is divided into elements and the rotor 
is divided into annuli.  Two simultaneous equations
 are developed: one expresses the lift and 
drag coefficient (and thus forces) on the blade ele
ments as a function of airfoil data and the 
wind's angle of attack.  The other expresses forces
 on the annuli as a function of the wind 
through the rotor, rotor characteristics, and chang
es in momentum.  Some of the key assumptions 
are: (i) the forces on blade elements are determine
d solely by lift/drag characteristics of the 
airfoil, (ii) there is no flow along the blade, (ii
i) lift and drag force are perpendicular and parall
el 
respectively to a ﬁrelative wind,ﬂ and (iv) forces 
are resolved into components perpendicular to 
the rotor (ﬁthrustﬂ) and tangential to it (ﬁtorqueﬂ
).   
Using BEM theory, it may be shown for an ideal roto
r that the angle of relative wind, 
, 
as a function of tip speed ratio and radial positio
n on the blade is given by:

Similarly, the chord length is given by:  
 ()
jpcos
18-=LBC
rc (14) 
Where 
B = the number of blades 
There are some useful observations to be drawn out 
of the above equations.  First of all, 
in the ideal case the blade will be twisted.  In fa
ct, the twist angle will differ from the angle of 
relative wind by the angle of attack and a referenc
e pitch angle 
p as follows: 
 pTqajq--= (15) 
It may also be noted that the twist angle will at f
irst increase slowly when moving from 
the tip inward and then increase more rapidly.  Sec
ond, the chord of the blade will also increase 
upon moving from the tip inward, at first slowly an
d then more rapidly.  In the ideal case then, a 
wind turbine blade is both significantly twisted an
d tapered.  Real blades, however, are designed 
with a less than optimal shape for a variety of pra
ctical reasons. 
Another important observation has to do with the to
tal area of the blades in comparison to 
the swept area.  The ratio of the projected blade a
rea is known as the solidity, 
. For a given 
angle of attack, the solidity will decrease with in
creasing tip speed ratio.  For example, assuming 
a lift coefficient 
CL of 1.0, the solidity of an optimum rotor designed 
to operate at a tip speed 
ratio of 2.0 is 0.43 whereas an optimum rotor desig
ned to operate at a tip speed ratio of 6.0 
would have a solidity of 0.088.  It is therefore ap
parent that in order to keep blade material (and 
thus cost) to a minimum, it is desirable to design 
for a tip speed ratio as high as possible.   
There are other considerations in selecting a desig
n tip speed ratio for a turbine other than 
the solidity, however.  On the one hand, higher tip
 speed ratios will result in gearboxes with a 
lower speed up ratio for a given turbine.  On the o
ther hand, the effect of drag and surface 
roughness of the blade surface may become more sign
ificant for a higher tip speed ratio rotor.  
This effect could result in decreased performance. 
 Another concern is material strength.  The 
total forces on the rotor are nearly the same on th
e rotor regardless of the solidity.  Thus the 
stresses would be higher.  A final consideration is
 noise.  Higher tip speed ratios generally result 
in more noise produced by the blades.   
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

 There are numerous other considerations regarding t
he design of a wind turbine rotor, 
including tip losses, type of airfoil to be used, e
ase of manufacturing and transport, type of 
control used, selection of materials, etc.  These a
re all outside the scope of this overview, 
however. 
Real wind turbine rotors are designed taking into a
ccount many factors, including but not 
only their aerodynamic performance.  In addition, t
he rotor must be controlled so as to generate 
electricity most effectively and so as to withstand
 continuously fluctuating forces during normal 
operation and extreme loads during storms.  Accordi
ngly, a wind turbine rotor does not in 
general operate at its own maximum power coefficien
t at all wind speeds.  Because of this, the 
power output of a wind turbine is generally describ
ed by curve, known as a power curve, rather 
than an equation such as the one for 
PWT
 which given earlier.  Figure AA.8 illustrates a typ
ical 
power curve. As shown there, below the cut-in speed
 (3 m/s in the example) no power is 
produced.  Between cut-in and rated wind speed (14.
5 m/s in this example), the power increases 
significantly with wind speed.  Above the rated spe
ed, the power produced is constant, regardless 
of the wind speed, and above the cut-out speed (25 
m/s in the example), the turbine is shut down.

AA.7 Wind Turbine Mechanics and Dynamics 
Earlier we discussed the aerodynamic aspects of a w
ind turbine, and how that related to 
its design, performance, and appearance.  The next 
major consideration has to do with the 
turbine™s survivability.  This topic includes its a
bility to withstand the forces to which the turbine
 









 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AA-

| Page
 will be subjected, deflections of various component
s, and vibrations that may result during 
operations.  
Issues that need to be considered include: (i) ulti
mate strength, (ii) relative motion of 
components, (iii) vibrations, (iv) loads, (v) respo
nses, (vi) stresses, (vii) unsteady motion, 
resulting in fatigue, and (viii) material propertie
s. 
The types of loads that a turbine may be subjected 
to are as follows: static (non-rotating), 
steady (rotating), cyclic, transient, impulsive, st
ochastic, or resonance-induced.  Sources of loads 
may include aerodynamics, gravity, dynamic interact
ions, or mechanical control.  To understand 
the various loads that a wind turbine may experienc
e, the reader may wish to review the 
fundamentals of statics (no motion), dynamics (moti
on), Newton's second law, the various 
rotational relations (kinematics), strength of mate
rials (including Hooke's law and finding 
stresses from moments and geometry), gyroscopic for
ces/moments, and vibrations.  Among other 
topics, the cantilevered beam is particularly impor
tant, since rotor blades as well as towers have 
similar characteristics. 
Wind turbines are frequently both the source of and
 are subject to vibrations.  Although 
the topic can become quite complicated, it is worth
while to recall that the natural frequency of 
simple oscillating mass, 
m, and spring, with spring constant, 
k, and is given by:  
 mk/=w (16) 
Similarly, rotational natural frequency about an ax
is of rotation is given by: 
 Jk/qw= (17) 
Where 
k is the rotational spring constant and 
J is the mass moment of inertia 
A continuous body, such as a wind turbine blade, wi
ll actually have an infinite number of 
natural frequencies (although only the first few ar
e important), and associated with each natural 
frequency will be a mode shape that characterizes i
t deflection.  The vibration of a uniform 
cantilevered beam can be described relatively simpl
y through the use of Euler™s equation (see 
Manwell et al., 2009).  Non-uniform elements requir
e more complex methods for their analysis.
AA.7.a Rotor Motions 
There is a variety of motions that occur in the rot
or that can be significant to the design or 
operation of the turbine.  These include those in t
he flapwise, edgewise, and torsional directions. 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AA-
16 
| Page
 Flapwise motions are those that are perpendicular t
o plane of the rotor, and are 
considered positive in the direction of the thrust.
  Flapwise forces are the source of the highest 
aerodynamic bending moments, and accordingly the mo
st significant stresses. 
Lead-lag, or edgewise, motions are in plane of roto
r and are considered positive when in 
the direction of the torque.  Fluctuating motions i
n this direction are reflected in the power.  
Torsion refers to the twisting of blade about its l
ong axis.  Torsional moments in the 
blades must be accounted for in the design of pitch
 control mechanisms. 
The most important rotor load is the thrust.  This 
is the total force on the rotor in the 
direction of the wind (flapwise).  It is associated
 with the conversion of the kinetic energy of the 
wind to mechanical energy.  The thrust, 
T, (N) is given by: 
 2221URCTTpr
= (18) 
Where 
CT is the thrust coefficient.  For the ideal rotor in
 which the axial induction factor, 
a, is equal to 1/3 (corresponding to the Betz limit)
, it is easy to show that the thrust coefficient is
 
equal to 8/9.  For the same rotor, the thrust coeff
icient may be as high as 1.0, but this would not 
occur at 
Cp = 
Cp,Betz
. 
This thrust gives rise to flapwise bending moments 
at the root of the blade.  For example, 
for the ideal rotor when a = 1/3, and assuming a ve
ry small hub, it may be shown that the 
flapwise bending moment 
M at the root of the blade would be given by: 
 RBTM32=b (19) 
Where 
B = number of blades 
From the bending moment, it is straightforward to f
ind the maximum bending stress in 
the blade.  For example, suppose that a blade is 2
t m thick at the root, has a symmetrical airfoil, 
and that the thrust force is perpendicular to the c
hord line.  Then the bending stress would be: 
 bItMbb=max,
 (20) 
(Note that for a real blade, the asymmetry and the 
angles would complicate the calculation, but 
the principle is the same.) 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AA-

 Another important load is torque, 
Q (Nm).  Torque is given by: 
 2221URCQQpr
= (21) 
Where 
CQ = the torque coefficient, which also equal to 
Cp/. Note that torque is also given by: 
 W=/PQ (22) 
Where 
P = power (W) 
The dynamics of a wind turbine rotor are quite comp
licated and do not lend themselves to 
simple illustrations. There is one approach, howeve
r, due to Stoddard (Eggleston and Stoddard, 
1987) and summarized by (Manwell et al., 2009) whic
h is relatively tractable, but will not be 
discussed here.  In general, the dynamic response o
f wind turbine rotors must be simulated by 
numerical models, such as the FAST code (Jonkman, 2
005) developed by the National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory. 

AA.7.b Fatigue 
Fatigue is an important phenomenon in all wind turb
ines. The term refers to the 
degradation of materials due to fluctuating stresse
s.  Such stresses occur constantly in wind 
turbines due to the inherent variability of the win
d, the rotation of the rotor and the yawing of the 
rotor nacelle assembly (RNA) to follow the wind as 
its direction changes.  Fatigue results in 
shortened life of many materials and must be accoun
ted for in the design.  Figure AA.9 
illustrates a typical time history of bending momen
t that would give rise to fluctuating stresses of 
similar appearance.

  Figure AA.9:  Typical wind turbine blade bending mo
ment 
The ability of a material to withstand stress fluct
uations of various magnitudes is 
typically illustrated in an S-N curve.  In such cur
ves the stress level is shown on the 
y axis and is 
plotted against the number of cycles to failure.  A
s is apparent from the figure above, stress 
fluctuations of a variety of magnitudes are likely.
  The effect of a number of cycles of different 
ranges is accounted for by the damage due to each c
ycle using ﬁMiner™s Rule.ﬂ  In this case, an 
amount of damage, 
d, due to 
n cycles, where the stress is such that 
N cycles will result in damage 
is found as follows: 
 Nnd/= (23) 
Miner™s Rule states that the sum of all the damage,
 
D, from cycles of all magnitudes must 
be less than 1.0, or failure is to be expected immi
nently: 
 £=1/iiNnD (24) 
Miner™s Rule works best when the cycling is relativ
ely simple.  When cycles of varying 
amplitude follow each other, an algorithm called "r
ainflow" cycle countingﬂ (Downing and 
Socie, 1982) is used.

 AA.8 Components of Wind Turbines 
Wind turbines consist of two main subsystems, the r
otor nacelle assembly and the support 
structure, and each of these is comprised of many c
omponents.  The following provides some 
more description of these subsystems.

More details, particularly on the rotor nacelle ass
embly 
may be found in (Manwell et al., 2009).
AA.8.a Rotor Nacelle Assembly 
The rotor nacelle assembly (RNA) includes the major
ity of the components associated 
with the conversion of the kinetic energy of the wi
nd into electrical energy.  There are two major 
component groupings in the RNA as well as a number 
of ancillary components.  The main 
groupings are the rotor and the drive train.  The r
otor includes the blades, the hub, and pitch 
control components.  The drive train includes shaft
s, bearings, gearbox (if any), couplings, 
mechanical brake, and generator. Other components i
nclude the bedplate, yaw bearing and yaw 
drive, oil cooling system, climate control, other e
lectrical components, and parts of the control 
system.  An example of a typical rotor nacelle asse
mbly is illustrated in Figure AA.10.

d.gov.hk/english/wind/large/large_to.html) 
 AA.8.b Rotor 
The primary components of the rotor are the blades.
  At the present time, most wind 
turbines have three blades, and they are oriented s
o as to operate upwind of the tower.  It is to be 
expected that in the future some wind turbines, par
ticularly those intended for use offshore, will 
have two blades and will be oriented downwind of th
e tower, however.  For a variety of reasons 
(including that downwind turbines tend to be noisie
r) it is less likely that they will be used on 
land, particularly in populated areas.  
The general shape of the blades is chosen in accord
ance with the principles discussed 
previously.  The other major factor is the required
 strength of the blades. For this reason, it is 
often the case that thicker airfoils are used neare
r the root than are used closer to the tip.  Blades
 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AA-
21 
| Page
 for most modern wind turbines are constructed of co
mposites.  The laminates are primarily 
fiberglass with some carbon fiber for additional st
rength.  The binders are polyester or epoxy. 
At the root of the blades the composite material is
 attached to a steel root, which can then 
be subsequently bolted to the hub.  Most utility sc
ale wind turbines at present include blade pitch 
control, so there is a mechanism present at the int
erface of the hub and the blades that will both 
secure the blades and facilitate their rotation abo
ut their long axis. 
The hub of the wind turbine rotor is constructed fr
om steel.  It is designed so as to attach 
to the main shaft of the drive train as well as to 
connect with the blades.  
AA.8.c Drive train 
The drive train consists of a number of components,
 including shafts, couplings, a 
gearbox (usually), a generator, and a brake. 

AA.8.d Shafts 
The main shaft of the drive train is designed to tr
ansmit the torque from the rotor to the 
gearbox (if there is one) or directly to the genera
tor if there is no gearbox.  This shaft may also 
be required to carry some or all of the weight of t
he rotor.  The applied torque will vary with the 
amount of power being produced, but in general it i
s given by the power divided by the rotational 
speed.  As discussed previously, a primary consider
ation in the aerodynamic design of a wind 
turbine rotor is the tip speed ratio.  A typical de
sign tip speed ratio is 7.  Consider a wind turbine
 
with a diameter of 80 m, designed for most efficien
t operation at a wind speed 12 m/s.  The 
rotational speed of the rotor and thus the main sha
ft under these conditions would be 20 rpm. 
AA.8.e Gearbox 
Wind turbines are intended to generate electricity,
 but most conventional generators are 
designed to turn at higher speeds than do wind turb
ine rotors (see below).  Therefore, a gearbox 
is commonly used to increase the speed of the shaft
 that drives the generator relative to that of 
the main shaft.  Gearboxes consist of a housing, ge
ars, bearings, multiple shafts, seals, and 
lubricants.  Gearboxes for wind turbines are typica
lly either of the parallel shaft or planetary 
type.  Frequently a gearbox incorporates multiple s
tages, since the maximum allowed ratio per 
stage is usually well under 10:1.  There are trade-
offs in the selection of gearbox.  Parallel shaft 
gearboxes are generally less expensive than planeta
ry ones but they are also heavier.  Gearboxes 
are generally quite efficient.  Thus the power out 
is very nearly equal to the power in.  The 
torque in the shafts is then equal to the power div
ided by the speed of the shaft. 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AA-
22 
| Page
 AA.8.f Brake 
Nearly all wind turbines incorporate a mechanical b
rake somewhere on the drive train.  
This brake is normally designed to stop the rotor u
nder all foreseeable conditions, although in 
some cases it might only serve as a parking brake f
or the rotor.  Mechanical brakes on utility 
scale wind turbines are mostly of the caliper/disc 
type although other types are possible.  Brakes 
may be placed on either the low speed or the high s
peed side of the gearbox.  The advantage of 
placing it on the high speed side is that less brak
ing torque is required to stop the rotor.  On the 
other hand, the braking torque must then pass throu
gh the gearbox, possibly leading to premature 
failure of the gearbox.  In either case, the brake 
must be designed to absorb all of the rotational 
energy in the rotor, which is converted into heat a
s the rotor stops.  
AA.8.g Generator 
Electrical generators operate via the rotation of a
 coil of wire in a magnetic field.  The 
magnetic field is created by one or more pairs of m
agnetic poles situated opposite each other 
across the axis of rotation.  The magnetic field ma
y be created either by electromagnets (as in 
conventional synchronous generators), by induction 
in the rotor (as in induction generators,) or 
with permanent magnets.  In alternating current sys
tems the number of pairs of poles and the grid 
frequency determine the nominal operating speed of 
the generator.  For example, in a 60 Hz AC 
system, such as the United States, a generator with
 two pairs of poles would have a nominal 
operating speed of 1800 rpm.  In most AC generators
, the field rotates and while the current is 
generated in a stationary armature (the stator).   
The majority of utility scale wind turbines today u
se wound rotor induction generators 
(WRIG).  This type of generator can function over a
 relatively wide range of speeds (on the order 
of 2:1).  Wound rotor induction generators are empl
oyed together with a power electronic 
converter in the rotor circuit.  In such an arrange
ment approximately 2/3 of the power is 
produced on the stator in the usual way.  The other
 third of the power is produced on the rotor 
and converted to AC of the correct frequency by the
 power electronic converter.  In this 
configuration the WRIG is often referred to as a do
ubly fed induction generator (DFIG).  
A number of wind turbines use permanent magnet gene
rators.  Such generators often 
have multiple pole pairs as well.  This can allow t
he generator to have the same nominal speed as 
the wind turbine rotor so the main shaft can be con
nected directly to the generator without the 
use of a gearbox.  Most permanent magnet generators
 are designed to operate together with 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AA-

| Page
 power electronic converters.  These converters faci
litate variable speed operation of the turbine, 
while ensuring that the electricity that is produce
d is of constant frequency and compatible with 
the electrical grid to which the turbine is connect
ed. 
AA.8.h Bedplate 
The bedplate is a steel frame to which components o
f the drive train and other 
components of the RNA are attached.  It ensures tha
t all the components are properly aligned. 
AA.8.i Yaw System 
Most wind turbines today include a yaw system.  Thi
s system facilitates orienting the 
RNA into the wind as the wind direction changes.  F
irst of all, there is a slewing bearing that 
connects the top of the tower to the RNA, allowing 
the latter to rotate with respect to the former.  
Also attached to the top of the tower, and often to
 the outside perimeter of the slewing bearing, is 
a large diameter bull gear.  A yaw motor connected 
to a smaller gear is attached to the bedplate.  
When the yaw motor is energized, the small gear eng
ages the bull gear, causing the RNA to 
move relative to the tower.  A yaw controller ensur
es that the motion is in the proper direction 
and that it continues until the RNA is aligned with
 the wind.  A yaw brake holds the RNA fixed 
in position until the yaw controller commands a new
 orientation. 
AA.8.j Control System 
A wind turbine will have a control system that ensu
res the proper operation of the turbine 
at all times.  The control system has two main func
tions: supervisory control and dynamic 
control.  The supervisory control continuously moni
tors the external conditions and the operating 
parameters of the turbine, and starts it up or shut
s it down as necessary.  The dynamic control 
system ensures smooth operation of various controll
able components, such the pitch of the 
blades or the electrical torque of the generator.  
The control system may also be integrated with 
or at least be in communication with a condition mo
nitoring system that watches over the 
condition of various key components.   

AA.8.k Support Structure 
The support structure of a wind turbine is any part
 of the turbine that is below the main 
bearing.  The support structure for land-based wind
 turbines may be conceptually divided into 
two main parts: the tower and the foundation.  The 
tower of a wind turbine is normally 
constructed of tapered steel tubes.  The tubes are 
bolted together on site to form a single structure 
of the desired height.  The foundation of a wind tu
rbine is the part of the support structure, which 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

 is in contact with the ground.  Foundations are typ
ically constructed of reinforced concrete.  
When turbines are installed on rock, the foundation
s may be attached to the rock with rods, 
which are grouted into predrilled holes. 

AA.8.l Materials for Wind Turbines 
The primary types of materials used in the various 
components of wind turbines are steel, 
copper, composites, and concrete. 
 AA.9 Installation 
Installation of wind turbines may be a significant 
undertaking.  It involves the following: 
· Complete assessment of site conditions  
· Detailed preparing for the installation 
· Constructing the foundation 
· Delivering the components to the site 
· Assembling the components into sub-assemblies 
· Lifting the sub-assemblies into place with a crane 
· Installing the electrical equipment 
· Final testing 
More details may be found in (Manwell et al., 2009)

AA.10 Energy Production 
The purpose of wind turbines is to produce energy. 
 Energy production is usually 
considered annually.  The amount of energy that a w
ind turbine will produce in a year, 
Ey,
 is a 
function of the wind resource at the site where it 
is installed and the power curve of the wind 
turbine.  Estimates are usually done by calculating
 the expected energy that will be produced 
every hour of a representative year and then summin
g the energy from all of those hours as 
shown below: 
 ()
=D=8760

Where 
Ui is the wind speed in the

 hour of the year, 
PWT
(Ui) is the average power 
(based on the power curve) during the 
ith
 hour and 
t is the length of the time period of interest 
(here, one hr).  The units of energy are Wh, but th
e amount of energy production is frequently 
expressed in either kWh or MWh for the sake of conv
enience.

 It is sometimes cumbersome to characterize the perf
ormance of a wind turbine by its 
actual energy production.  Accordingly, a normalize
d term known as the capacity factor, 
CF
, is 
used.  This is the given by the actual energy that 
is produced (or estimated to be produced) 
divided by the amount of energy that would be produ
ced if the turbine were running at is rated 
output, 
PR, for the entire year.  It is found from the follow
ing equation:

AA.11 Unsteady Aspects of Wind Turbine Operation 
There are a number of unsteady aspects of wind turb
ine operation that are significant to 
the discussion of public reaction to wind turbines.
  These in particular include the variations in 
the wind field that can change the nature of the so
und emitted from the rotor during operation.  
These unsteady effects include the following: 
1.
 Wind shear Œ Wind shear refers to the variation of 
wind speed across some spatial 
dimension.  Wind shear is most commonly thought of 
as a vertical phenomenon, that 
is to say, the increase of wind speed with height. 
 Wind shear can also occur laterally 
across the rotor under some circumstances.  Vertica
l wind shear is often modeled by a 
power law as discussed earlier.  There are some sit
uations, however, in which such a 
model is not applicable. One example has to with hi
ghly stable atmosphere, such that 
the wind near the ground is relatively light, but a
t the height of the rotor the wind is 
high enough that turbine may be operating.  Under s
uch conditions there may be 
sound emanating from the rotor, but relatively litt
le wind induced sound near the 
ground to mask that from the rotor.  Wind shear may
 also result in a cyclically 
varying aspect to the sound produced by the blades 
as they rotate.  This occurs due to 
the changing magnitude and direction of the relativ
e wind as the blades pass through 
zones of different wind speed. 
2.
 Tower shadow or blockage Œ The wind flow near the t
ower is inevitably somewhat 
different from where there is no tower.  The effect
 is much more pronounced on wind 
turbines with downwind rotors, but it still occurs 
with up-wind rotors.  This tower 
effect can result in a distinct change in sound onc
e per revolution of each blade. 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AA-

| Page
 3.
 Turbulence Œ Turbulence refers to changes in magnit
ude and direction of the wind at 
varying time scales and length scales.  The presenc
e of turbulence can affect the 
nature of the sound. 
4.
 Changes in wind direction Œ Wind turbines are desig
ned to yaw in response to 
changes in wind direction.  The yawing process take
s a finite amount of time and 
during that time the wind impinging on the rotor wi
ll do so at a different direction 
than it will when the yawing process is complete.  
Sound produced during the yawing 
process may have a somewhat different character tha
n after it is complete. 
5.
 Stall Œ Under some conditions part or all of the ai
rfoils on the blades may be in stall.  
That is, the angle of relative wind is high enough 
that the airfoil begins to lose lift.  
Additional turbulence may also be generated.  Again
, the nature of the sound 
produced by the rotor may be different than during 
an unstalled state.  It may also be 
noted that some turbines intentionally take advanta
ge of stall to limit power in high 
winds.  Under such conditions there may also be a c
hange in sound in comparison to 
normal operation. 
AA.11.a Periodicity of Unsteady Aspects of Wind Tur
bine Operation 
Due to the rotation of the rotor and the nature of 
the wind, there tend to be certain 
features of the turbine™s operation that are period
ic in nature.  The most dominant of these have 
frequencies associated with the rotational speed of
 the rotor and the blade passage frequency, 
which is simply the rotational speed times the numb
er of blades.  For example, the dominant 
frequencies in a 3-blade wind turbine rotating at 2
0 rpm would be 0.33 Hz and 1 Hz.  Other 
significant frequencies may be the first few harmon
ics of the rotational frequency and blade 
passage frequency. 

AA.12 Wind Turbines and Avoided Pollutants 
Wind turbines have a positive impact on human healt
h via avoiding emission of 
pollutants that would result if the electricity tha
t they generate were produced instead by other 
generators.  While the average emissions of various
 pollutants per MWh produced from 
conventional generators is relatively easy to estim
ate, it is harder to estimate the actual impact of 
wind turbine generation.  This is because the elect
ricity distributed by the electrical grid is 
produced by different types of generators, and the 
operation of these generators will be affected 
differently as a result of the supply of part of th
e total electrical demand by the wind turbines. 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AA-

 In general, electricity in any large utility networ
k comes from three types of generators: 
base load, intermediate load, and peaking plants.  
The fuel or energy source supplying these 
generators is likely to be coal, fuel oil, natural 
gas, uranium (nuclear plants), or water 
(hydroelectric plants). Base load plants are typica
lly coal fired or nuclear plants. Intermediate 
load plants often use fuel oil or natural gas.  Pea
king plants are normally natural gas or 
hydroelectric.  There are a considerable number of 
plants that may be operating at any given 
time.  Which plants are actually operating is deter
mined by the system operator in accordance 
with what the near term forecasted load is expected
 to be and the estimated (bid) cost per MWh 
from all the plant operators in the system.  For th
ermal plants the bid cost is close to that 
projected fuel cost/MWh.  This in turn is found fro
m heat rate of the fuel (kg/MWh) for the plant 
in question times the unit cost of the fuel ($/kg).
  Less efficient plants or those with higher unit 
fuel costs tend to have relatively high bid costs. 
 (Note on the other hand, that wind turbines 
would have bid costs of zero, since they do not use
 fuel.)  
If a large number of wind turbines are operating su
ch that they are contributing a 
significant amount of electricity to the total load
, the mix of generators may well be different 
than it would be if the turbines were not present. 
 If only a small number of wind turbines are 
present, then the mix of generators may not change.
  However, certain of the plants would be 
curtailed so as to produce less energy and thus con
sume less fuel.  The emissions of pollutants 
from all the operating plants could be calculated a
nd so could the projected emissions that would 
have resulted if the wind turbines were not present
.  The difference in amount of pollutants 
produced could then be assigned to the wind turbine
 as the avoided emissions.   
To do such an analysis properly involves estimating
 the actual impact of wind turbine 
generation on the mix of generators and the operati
ng level of those generators for every hour of 
the year.  This is a non-trivial exercise, but it h
as been done for an offshore wind farm that was 
proposed for the town of Hull, MA.  That project wa
s to have included four 3.6 MW turbines, for 
a total capacity of 14.4 MW.  The pollutants consid
ered in the study were CO
2, NO
X,
 and SO
X.  
The results of that study are described in detail i
n (Rached, 2008).  The results of that study are 
summarized in Table AA.1.  The results in the table
 are normalized for a 1 MW (rated) wind 
turbine and use the medium estimated wind speed for
 the site.  (Note under the assumptions of 
Rached™s study, a one MW (rated) wind turbine in th
e medium wind speed scenario at the site 
would generate 2,580 MWh/yr).

Avoided emissions of pollutants for 14.4 MW wind pr
oject (based on Rached, 2008) 






˘ˇˆ˘
A simpler but less accurate way to estimate the avo
ided emissions is to use the marginal 
rates for pollutants as specified by the Massachuse
tts Greenhouse Gas policy (MEPA, 2007).  
Applying this method Rached calculated avoided emis
sions per MW (rated) for the three 
pollutants for one year of 1,320,000 kg CO
2, 2,080 kg of SO
2, and 701 kg of NO
x. 
In the analysis summarized above the majority of th
e avoidance of pollutant production 
would be due to reduced consumption of natural gas.
  If a larger fraction of Massachusetts™ 
energy were to be produced by wind energy, there co
uld be significant reductions of the 
consumption of fuel oil and coal as well.  This sho
uld result in larger amounts of avoided 
pollution per unit of wind turbine production

Wind Turbines Œ Shadow Flicker 
AB.1 Shadow Flicker and Flashing 
Shadow flicker occurs when the moving blades of a w
ind turbine rotor cast moving 
shadows that cause a flickering effect.  This flick
er could annoy people living close to the 
turbine.  Similarly, it is possible for sunlight to
 be reflected from gloss-surfaced turbine blades 
and cause a ﬁflashingﬂ effect.  This phenomenon wil
l occur during a limited amount of time in a 
year, depending on the altitude of the sun, 
s; the height of the turbine, 
H, the radius of the rotor, 
R,
 and the height, direction and distance to the view
ing point.  At any given time the maximum 
distance from a turbine that a flickering shadow wi
ll extend is given by:

The hour angle is found from the hours from noon (s
olar time, negative before noon, 
positive after noon), divided by 15 to convert to d
egrees. 
Another relevant angle is the solar azimuth.  This 
indicates the angle of the sun with 
respect to certain reference direction (usually nor
th) at a particular time.  For example, the sun is 
always in the south at solar noon, so its azimuth i
s 180° at that time.  The solar azimuth is 
important since it determines the angle of the wind
 turbine™s shadow with respect to the tower.  
See Duffie and Beckman (2006) for details on calcul
ating the solar azimuth.

 discussed in the previous paragraph).  This plannin
g can be site-specific in order to avoid 
potential problems with specific sites based on geo
graphical location or weather patterns.  
In terms of safe distances to reduce shadow flicker
, these are often project-specific 
because it depends on whether there are residences 
or roadways present and what the geographic 
layout is.  This could be particularly important in
 areas with more forestry and existing shadow, 
which could reduce nuisance from turbine produced s
hadow flicker or whether it is an otherwise 
open land area such as farmland that would be more 
susceptible to the annoyance of shadow 
flicker.  A general estimate for modeling a shadow 
flicker risk zone includes 10 times the rotor 
diameter such that a 90-meter diameter would be equ
ivalent to a 900-meter impact area.  
However, only certain portions of this zone are act
ually likely to experience shadow flicker for a 
significant amount of time.  Other modeling conside
rations include when at least 20% of the sun 
is covered by the blade and whether to include the 
blade width in estimates as well.  In terms of 
distance, 2,000 meters is the WindPro computer prog
ram default distance (NEWEEP, 2011) for 
calculations of wind turbine produced shadow flicke
r.  Finally, due to atmospheric effects,  
1400 m is the maximum distance from a turbine withi
n which shadow flicker is likely to be 
significant. 
In terms of existing regulations regarding shadow f
licker rates, there are no current 
shadow flicker regulations in Massachusetts (or man
y other New England states, but there are 
statewide and local guidelines that have been imple
mented.  These guidelines were provided by 
the Department of Energy Resources in March 2009 an
d state that, ﬁwind turbines shall be sited 
in a manner that minimizes shadowing or flicker imp
actsﬂ and, ﬁthe applicant has the burden of 
proving that this effect does not have significant 
adverse impact on neighboring or adjacent 
uses.ﬂ  Local Massachusetts regulations include the
 Worcester, MA zoning ordinance, which 
requires, ﬁThe facility owner and operator shall ma
ke reasonable efforts to minimize shadow 
flicker to any occupied building on a non-participa
ting landowner™s property.ﬂ  Also, a shadow 
flicker assessment report is required as is a plan 
showing the ﬁarea of estimated wind turbine 
shadow flicker.ﬂ  Similarly, the Newburyport, MA re
gulations require that wind turbines do not 
result in significant shadow or flicker impacts and
 an analysis is required for planned projects 
(NEWEEP, 2011).    
The Maine model wind energy facility ordinance stat
es that wind turbines should, ﬁavoid 
unreasonable adverse shadow flicker effect at any o
ccupied building located on a non-

tate any specific limit to shadow flicker other 
than these guidelines.  However, the New Hampshire 
Model Small Wind Energy Systems 
Ordinance states that wind turbines, ﬁshall be site
d in a manner that does not result in significant 
shadow flicker impacts–significant shadow flicker i
s defined as more than 30 hours per year on 
abutting occupied buildings.ﬂ  Similar to Maine, se
veral states in the US have adopted the 
German model of 30 hours per year of allowed shadow
 flicker that was primarily based on the 
government-sponsored study summarized above.  Howev
er, other states or localities including 
Hutchinson, Minnesota have enacted stricter guideli
nes including no shadow flicker to be 
allowed at an existing residential structure, and u
p to 30 hours per year of shadow flicker 
allowed on roadways or residentially zoned properti
es and a computer analysis is required for 
project approval (NEWEEP, 2011).  
In addition, computer programs such as WindPro are 
also recommended by most states 
and localities for use in all new planned installat
ions to reduce this potential nuisance of shadow 
flicker on residential properties or potential heal
th hazards to drivers on busy highways or 
roadways.

Wind Turbines Œ Ice Throw 
AC.1 Ice Falling or Thrown from Wind Turbines 
Under certain weather conditions ice may form on th
e surface of wind turbine blades.  
Normally, wind turbines intended for use in locatio
ns where ice may form are designed to shut 
down when there is a significant amount of ice on t
he blades.  The means to prevent operation 
when ice is present may include ice sensor and vibr
ation sensors.  Ice sensors are used on most 
wind turbines in cold climates.  Vibration sensors 
are used on nearly all wind turbines.  They 
would cause the turbine to shut down, for example, 
if ice buildup on the blades resulted in an 
imbalance of the rotor and hence detectable vibrati
ons in the structure.  
Ice built up on blades normally falls off while the
 turbine is stationary.  If that occurs 
during high winds, the ice could be blown by the wi
nd some distance from the tower.  In 
addition, it is conceivable that ice could be throw
n from a moving wind turbine blade under 
some circumstances, although that would most likely
 occur only during startup (while the 
rotational speed is still relatively low) or as a r
esult of the failure of the control system.  It is 
therefore worth considering what the maximum plausi
ble distance that a piece of ice could land 
from the turbine under two ﬁworst caseﬂ circumstanc
es: 1) ice falls from a stopped turbine during 
very high winds, and 2) ice is suddenly released fr
om a blade when the rotor is rotating at its 
normal operating speed. 
In both cases, the distance that the ice may travel
 is governed by Newton™s laws and the 
principles of fluid mechanics.  Calculations are qu
ite simple when the effect of the air (and the 
wind) is ignored.  For example, in that case if a p
iece of ice falls from a turbine, it will land 
directly below where it is released.  The situation
 is a little more complex, but still readily 
solvable if the piece of ice is moving when it is r
eleased.  For example, suppose that the ice is 
initially on the tip of a blade, and the blade is p
ointing vertically upward. Once the ice is released
 
it will continue moving horizontally at the speed i
t had when it was still attached to the blade.  
But it will also begin to fall towards the ground, 
so the piece of ice will have two components of 
velocity until the ice hits the ground.  The time 
tg (s) it takes for the ice to reach the ground 
(assuming a horizontal surface) is 
ghtg/2= where 
h = height (m) at which the ice is released 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY

 and 
g = acceleration of gravity (9.81 m/s
2).  The distance 
x (m) that the ice would travel is 
RtxgW= where 
 is the rotational speed of the rotor (rad/s) and 
R is the length of the blade (m).  
Such an analysis is overly simplified, however.  It
 would underestimate the distance that 
the ice would travel if it fell from a stationary t
urbine in a high wind, and it would overestimate 
the distance that the ice would travel if it were s
uddenly released from a moving blade.  It is 
necessary to consider the effect of the air and the
 force that it will impart upon the falling ice. Fo

: 
 zzma
F=  (30) 
where 
Fz is the net force (N), 
m is the mass (kg), and 
az is the acceleration (m/s
2).  The force 
includes two main components.  One is the weight, 
W (N).  It is due to gravity and acts in the 
negative 
z direction.  The other one is due to the drag of th
e air and it acts opposite to the 
direction of the velocity.  It is found from:

where

A is the projected area (m

of the piece of ice, 
CD is the drag coefficient of the ice and 
Vz is the velocity of the ice (m/s) in 
the 
z direction.   
Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity, so 
we can rewrite the equation of motion

Where

piece of ice may leave the blade with initial speed
 
R at an arbitrary angle 
 with respect to the 
horizontal.  Accordingly, there will be two compone
nts of the velocity, one in the 
z direction (as 
before) 
Vz, the other in the 
x direction, 
Vx.  This assumes that the 
x axis is horizontal, is also in 
the plane of the rotor, and is positive in the dire

ice falling from a stationary turbine. 
Some data from actual ice throw has been compiled b
y Seifert et al. (2003).  Figure AC.1, 
taken from that report is shown below.

om Seifert et al., 2003)

 As may be seen in the figure, the maximum distance 
that ice was observed to fall from a 
turbine with a diameter of 20 m during operation wa
s approximately 100 m.  Based on the 
observed data, Seifert et al. suggest the following
 simplified formula for the maximum throwing 
distance: 
 ()HRxthrow
+=25.1
max,
 (36) 
Where 
xmax,throw
 = maximum throwing distance (m), 
R = rotor diameter (m) and 
H = hub height 
(m). 
By way of illustration, Equation 36 was used to pre
dict the maximum throwing distance 
of a piece of ice from a turbine with a rotor radiu
s of 20 m installed on a tower 50 m high.  That 
distance was 135 m.  The theoretical equations give
n previously were also used to calculate 
throwing distance.  The following assumptions were 
made: spherically shaped piece of ice, drag 
coefficient of 1.2, air density of 1.225 kg/m
3, ice density of 700 kg/m
3, rotor speed of 40 rpm 
(corresponding to a tip speed ratio of 7 at a wind 
speed of 12 m/s), angle of release of 45°, and 
instantaneous release of the ice.  The equations pr
edict a maximum throwing distance of 226 m 
or somewhat less than twice that predicted from the
 empirical equation.  The difference is 
deemed to be reasonable, especially considering the
 idealized shape of the particle.  Real pieces 
of ice would actually be highly non-spherical in sh
ape and experience considerably more drag.  It 
may also be noted that it was reported in Cattin et
 al. (2007) that ice did not fall as far from a 
wind turbine in the Swiss Alps as would be predicte
d from Equation 36.  In that case the 
maximum observed distance from a turbine with radiu
s of 20 m and a tower height of 50 m was 
92 m.  As noted above, Equation 36 predicts 135 m. 
Seifert et al. also considered data regarding ice t
hrown from stationary turbines.  Based 
on the available data they proposed a simple equati
on for predicted ice fall.  That equation is 
 ()15/
max,
HRUxfall
+= (37)  
Where 
U = wind speed at hub height in m/s, 
xmax,fall
 = maximum falling distance (m), 
R = rotor 
radius (m), 
H = hub height (m). 
Using Equation 37, the predicted maximum distance f
or a turbine with a radius of 20 m, a 
tower height of 50 m, and a wind speed of 20 m/s is
 120 m.  By way of comparison, the fall 
distance was predicted from the theoretical equatio
ns given above for the same situation.  The 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AC-

 results are highly dependent on the size of the pie
ce of ice and hence the surface to volume ratio.  
To take one example, a piece of ice that was assume
d to be spherical and to have a weight of 10 
g would land 110 m from the tower.  In the examples
 discussed by Seifert et al., all the pieces of 
ice landed less than 100 m from the tower. 

AC.2 Summary of Ice Throw Discussion 
As noted above, there are two plausible scenarios i
n which ice may fall from a wind 
turbine and may land at some distance from the towe
r.  In the first scenario, ice that falls from a 
stationary turbine is blown some distance from the 
tower.  In the second scenario, ice is thrown 
from the blade of an operating turbine during a fai
lure of the control system.  In the first case, ice
 
may land 100 m or more from the tower in high winds
, depending on the wind speed, the height 
from which the ice falls, and the dimensions of the
 ice.  In the second case, the ice could land 
even further from the turbine.  Just how far would 
depend on the actual speed of the rotor when 
the ice was shed, the height of the tower, the leng
th of the blade, the angular position of the blade 
when the ice was released, and the size and shape o
f the ice.  In general, it appears that ice is 
unlikely to land farther from the turbine than its 
maximum vertical extent (tower height plus the 
radius.)

 Appendix D 
Wind Turbine Œ Noise Introduction 
Noise is defined simply as unwanted sound.  Sound i
s defined as the sensation produced 
by stimulation of the organs of hearing by vibratio
ns transmitted through the air or other 
medium.  In air, the transmission is due to a repea
ting cycle of compressed and expanded air.  
The frequency of the sound is the number of times p
er second, Hertz (Hz), that the cycle repeats.  
Sound at a single frequency is called a tone while 
sound that is a combination of many 
frequencies is called broadband.  
The human ear is capable of responding over a frequ
ency range from approximately 20 
Hz to 20 kHz (Hz: Hertz = 1 cycle/second; Middle C 
on a piano is a frequency of 262 Hz).    
AD.1 Sound Pressure Level 
Sound is characterized by both its frequency and it
s amplitude.  Sound pressure is 
measured in micro Pascals (
m
).  Because sound pressure can vary over a wide ran
ge of 
magnitudes a logarithmic scale is used to convert m
icro Pascals to decibels.  Thus sound pressure 
level (SPL) is defined by SPL = 10 log
10
 [p
2/p
2ref
] = 20 log
10
(p/p
ref
) with the resulting number 
having the units of decibels (dB).  The reference p
ressure p
ref 
for airborne sound is 20 X 10
-6
 Pa 
(i.e., 20
mPa or 20 micro Pascals).  This means that SPL of 0 
dB corresponds to a sound wave 
with amplitude 20
mPa.  140 dB is considered the threshold of pain and
 corresponds to 
20,000,000 
mPa.  Doubling the amplitude of the sound wave incre
ases the SPL by 6 dB. 
Therefore, a 40
mPa amplitude sound wave would have an SPL of about 
6 dB. 
When it is stated that there is a large frequency r
ange over which humans can hear, it is 
also noted that the ear does not hear each frequenc
y similarly.  In fact, there is a frequency-
dependent threshold of hearing (lower limit) and th
reshold of pain (higher limit).  Experiments 
have been performed to determine these thresholds. 
 The threshold of hearing curves show that 
one can hear a tone at 3 kHz (3000 Hz) with an SPL 
< 0 dB while at 100 Hz one does not hear 
the tone until its SPL is about 30 dB.  Curves show
ing the thresholds can be easily found in 
textbooks and online (one online example is at  
http://www.santafevisions.com/csf/html/lectures/007
_hearing_II.htm
).  Experiments have also 
been conducted to determine equal loudness level co
ntours.  These contours indicate when two 
tones of dissimilar frequencies appear to be equall
y loud.   
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AD-

| Page
 Some characteristics of human response to sound inc
lude: 
· Changes in sound level <1 dB cannot be perceived 
· Doubling the magnitude of the acoustic pressure lea
ds to a 6 dB increase in SPL 
· A 5 dB SPL change will result in a noticeable commu
nity response 
· A 10 dB SPL change is subjectively heard as an appr
oximate doubling in loudness  
AD.2 Frequency Bands 
Most sounds in our environment contain multiple fre
quencies and are variable in that 
successive identical experiments cannot result in t
he exact same plot or tabulation of pressure vs. 
time.  Therefore, it is common to use averages that
 measure approximately the amplitude of the 
sound and its frequency content.  Common averaging 
methods rely on the principle of octaves, 
such as 1/10, 1/3, and single octave bands.  This m
eans that the entire frequency range is broken 
into chunks such that the relation between the star
ting and ending frequencies of each chunk, f
1 and f
2 respectfully, are related by f
2 = 2
1/N
f1 where N = 1 for a single octave band and 3 for a 1
/3 
octave band.  Because the bands can be constructed 
based on any starting frequency, a 
standardized set of bands have been specified.  The
y are usually described by the center 
frequency of each band.  The standard octave-bands 
are given in Table AD.1 (measured in Hz):

16000 11360 22720 
A similar set of bands can be written for the 1/3 o
ctaves.  For each octave band there are 
3-1/3 octave bands.  Many text and online resources
 specify the 1/3 octave bands such as 
(http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/octave-bands-freq
uency-limits-d_1602.html
).  The 1/10 
octave band is a narrow-band filter and is used whe
n the sound contains important tones. 
AD.3 Weightings 
Noise data are often presented as 1/3 octave band m
easurements.  Again, this means that 
the sound in each frequency band has been averaged 
over that frequency range.  Noise levels are 
also often reported as weighted values.  The most c
ommon weighting is A weighting.  It was 
originally intended to be such that sounds of diffe
rent frequencies giving the same decibel 
reading with A weighting would be equally loud.  Th
e weighting of the octave band centered at 
31.5 Hz requires one to subtract 39.4 dB from the a
ctual SPL.  The octave bands with centers 
from 1000 to 8000 where human hearing is most sensi
tive are corrected by only about +/- 1 dB.  
When considered together with the threshold of hear
ing, it is clear that the A-weighting is most 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AD-

| Page
 applicable for sounds of small amplitude.  C-weight
ing on the other hand subtracts only a few dB 
from the very highest and very lowest frequency ban
ds.  It is therefore more applicable for 
higher levels of sound.  The figure below shows the
se two weightings.  When weighted, the 
sound pressure level is reported as dBA or dBC resp
ectively. 
   Figure AD.1:  Weighting values for reporting sou
nd pressure levels

 Noise levels change several times per day.  To acco
unt for these differences other 
environmental noise measures are often used as show
n in Table AD1.

 AD.4 Sound Power 
Sound intensity and sound power are also often repo
rted.  Sound intensity is a measure of 
the energy transported per unit area and time in a 
certain direction.  It can be shown that the 
intensity
(˚)perpendicular to the direction of sound propagation
 is related to the amplitude of the 
pressure wave squared, the density of the air
(r), 
and the speed of sound

quantities are normally reported in dB where the in

 AD.5 Example Data Analysis 
This is an example of the type of analysis done on 
sound measurements from a wind 
turbine.  First, the actual signal might look somet
hing like what is shown in Figure AD.2.

.  
(From(van den Berg, 2011), related to Rheine wind t
urbine farm).  Left in Pascals, right as SPL in dB
. 
In Figure AD.2, just the acoustic pressure is shown
, which means that atmospheric 
pressure, which is about 103,000 Pa, has been subtr
acted and the fluctuations then appear around 
0 Pa.  These data can easily be presented as SPL by
 transforming the pressure from Pa to dB.  In 
order to analyze the pressure signal for low freque
ncy content, a much longer time signal must 
be obtained.  The frequency content of a long time 
signal is analyzed by performing a Fourier 
Transform.  A typical transform of data from a wind
 turbine is shown in Figure AD.3.

AD.6 Wind Turbine Noise from Some Turbines  
What is known about aerodynamically generated noise
 from wind turbines is that it 
nominally increases with increasing wind speed unti
l the max power is obtained, and it increases 
with increasing rotor tip speed.  A report out of t
he Netherlands by (van den Berg et al., 2008) 
reports a vast amount of noise data related to wind
 turbines.  The tables in Appendices B and C 
from the report clearly show these trends.  Some of
 the data are reproduced here.  Only 
measurements that were made by third parties (not s
pecified by the wind turbine company) are 
reproduced here.

 It must be noted here that what has been reported a
re the sound power levels, which 
represents the total sound energy that propagates a
way from the wind turbine (i.e., the sound 
energy at the center of the blades, which propagate
s outward at the height of the hub).  The 
sound level measured at a single position at the ba
se of the turbine can easily be 50 dB lower 
(Lawrence rep.). 

AD.7 Definition of Infrasound 
Discussion of the aerodynamic source of sound known
 as thickness noise or self-noise 
requires one to define low frequency sound and infr
asound.  By definition, infrasound is a 
pressure wave that is not audible.  Nominally this 
means waves with frequency less than 20 Hz.  
It is noted though that waves with high enough ampl
itude below 20 Hz may still be audible.  
Low frequency sound is characterized as having a fr
equency between 20 and 200 Hz.  As 
mentioned earlier, some mechanical noise sources co
ntribute to the low frequency range, and 
clearly some of the aerodynamic sources of broadban
d sound will contribute to noise in the low 
frequency range.  Thickness noise, if present, woul
d have an associated frequency equal to the 
 WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 
AD-

| Page
 blade passing frequency.  Hence, a turbine with 3-b
laded rotor turning at 20 rpm might generate 
thickness noise at a frequency of 1 Hz, which is cl
early in the infrasonic range.  Downwind 
rotors produce slightly stronger infrasound at the 
blade passing frequency because the blades 
interact directly with the wake behind the tower.  
The levels of the thickness noise generated by 
modern upwind turbines are not perceptible by the h
uman auditory system.  Any impulsive noise 
that is audible, which seems to have a frequency eq
uivalent to the blade passing frequency, is 
actually the broadband noise generated by the other
 mechanisms being modified by differences 
in the flow that occur on a once-per-rev basis as d
iscussed above.  The frequencies of this 
pulsating sound are all in the audible range, and t
hus this sound is not infrasound.

terms of the diameter, 
D (m).  The third gives it in terms of both the tip

diameter.  These equations should only be used when
 test data is not available.

, and the relations of interest (actually the 
sound pressure level) take into account the relativ
e position of the turbines and the location of the 
observer as described below.

 AE.3 Noise Propagation from Wind Turbines 
The sound pressure level will decrease with distanc
e from a turbine.  For estimation 
purposes, a simple model based on hemispherical noi
se propagation over a reflective surface, 
including air absorption, is given as: 
R)R(LLWpa--=210

(43)
where 
Lp is the sound pressure level (dB) a distance 
R from a noise source radiating at a power 
level 
LW (dB) and 
 is the frequency-dependent sound absorption coeffi
cient.  For broadband 
estimates the absorption coefficient is often appro
ximated by a constant value of 0.005 dB(A)/m. 
Figure AE.1 (from Materialien 63) indicates the sou
nd pressure level as a function of 
distance from a single wind turbine with a sound po
wer level of 103 dB(A).

  It may be seen that Equation 43, using the broadban

results close to those in the table (270 m, 435 m, 
and 675 m respectively). 
AE.4 Noise Propagation from Multiple Wind Turbines 
The sound perceived at a distance from multiple win

 to that turbine.  The perceived value can be

The figure below illustrates sound pressure level a
s a function of wind speed from a pitch 
regulated wind turbine (The data was taken at an un
specified distance from the turbine).   
As can be seen, the noise level increases with wind
 speed up to a certain wind speed, here 
9 m/s.  After that wind speed is reached the blade 
pitch regulates the power and the noise level 
remains constant.

 AF.2 Noise from a Stall Regulated Wind Turbine 
The figure below illustrates sound pressure level a
s a function of wind speed from a stall 
controlled wind turbine (The data was taken at an u
nspecified distance from the turbine). 
 Figure AF.2:  from Materialien 63 
y-axis: sound pressure level, dB(A) 

x- axis measured wind speed at 10 m height, m/s 

The rated wind speed of this turbine is 10.4 m/s 
As can be seen, the noise level increases approxima
tely linearly with wind speed and 
does not level off.
