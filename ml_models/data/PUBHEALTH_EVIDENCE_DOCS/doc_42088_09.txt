 Q&amp;A on Coronavirus Vaccines           September 4, 2020      We give an overview of the vaccine development efforts underway and answer some questions about the testing process, the likelihood and timing of a vaccine in the U.S., and what to expect from a COVID-19 vaccine.
 New ‘Plandemic’ Video Peddles Misinformation, Conspiracies           August 21, 2020      The second part of “Plandemic” — a documentary-style video that presents a sweeping conspiracy theory about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, patents and vaccines — landed on Aug. 18, spinning together many of the falsehoods about the disease that we’ve been debunking for months, plus some new misleading claims.
 Colorado Vaccine Bill Includes Nonmedical Exemptions for Children           June 12, 2020      A Facebook meme falsely claims a Colorado bill is “removing exemptions” for parents who don’t want to vaccinate their children in order to attend school.
 The bill adds new requirements to opt out of vaccinations, but does offer medical and nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal beliefs.
 Nuremberg Code Addresses Experimentation, Not Vaccines           June 8, 2020      A bogus claim that “[v]accines are in direct violation of The Nuremberg Code” has been circulating on social media.
 Actually, the Nuremberg Code addresses the treatment of human subjects in medical experiments and says nothing about the use of tested and approved vaccines on patients.
 Meme Misrepresents Fauci’s Position on Vaccine Trials           June 5, 2020      A viral meme falsely suggests Dr. Anthony Fauci supports administering a COVID-19 vaccine before clinical trials are completed.
 Fauci supports the manufacture of vaccines while trials are underway — but only administering the vaccine once the trials are over and it is deemed effective and safe.
 Facebook Posts Distort Facts on Trump Actions           May 22, 2020      Facebook posts credit President Donald Trump with accomplishing a list of things that haven’t happened — claiming, for example, that he “cancelled” a proposed House bill on contact tracing and “expelled WHO.”      The Falsehoods of the ‘Plandemic’ Video           May 8, 2020      The first installment of a documentary called “Plandemic” stormed through social media this week.
 But the viral video weaves a grand conspiracy theory by using a host of false and misleading claims about the novel coronavirus pandemic and its origins, vaccines, treatments for COVID-19, and more.
 Conspiracy Theory Misinterprets Goals of Gates Foundation           April 14, 2020      A conspiracy theory falsely claims Bill Gates is plotting to use COVID-19 testing and a future vaccine to track people with microchips.
 The Gates Foundation has advocated for expanded testing and has funded vaccine research, but neither of those involves implanted microchips.
 False Claim of Deadly Coronavirus Vaccine Trial in Africa           April 10, 2020      Posts across social media are falsely claiming that a vaccine trial for the novel coronavirus in Senegal resulted in the death of seven children.
 The video behind those claims does not show that.
 And there is no clinical trial for a potential vaccine currently taking place in Senegal.
