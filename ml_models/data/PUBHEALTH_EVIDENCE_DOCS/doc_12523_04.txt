2 Effects on Health Insurance Coverage
  To estimate the 
budgetary 
effects
, CBO and JCT 
project
ed
 how the legislation would 
change the number of people 
who obtain 
federally subsidized health insurance through 
Medicaid, the nongroup market, and the employment
-based market, as well as many other 
factors.
  CBO and JCT estimate that, 
in 2018, 14 million more people would be uninsured 
under the 
legislation
 than
 under 
current law
. Most of th
at increase 
would stem from repealing the 
penalties associated with the individual mandate
. Some of those people would
 choose
 not 
to have insurance b
ecause they 
chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to 
avoid paying the penalties
, and some people would forgo insurance in response to higher 
premiums
.  Later, 
following
 additional changes to
 subsidies for insurance purchased
 in
 the nongro
up 
mar
ket and to the Medicaid program
, th
e increase 
in the number of uninsured people 
relative to 
the number under 
current law 
would rise 
to 
21 million
 in 2020
 and then to 
24 million in
 2026.
 The reductions in insurance coverage between 2018 and 2026 
would 
stem 
in large part 
from changes in Medicaid enrollment
Šbecause some
 states 
would 
discontinue
 their 
expansion
 of eligibility
, some 
states 
that would have 
expand
ed eligibility
 in the future 
would 
choo
se not to do so, and per
-enrollee spending in the pr
ogram
 would be
 capped. 
In 2026, an estimated 
52 million people would be uninsured, compared with 
28 million
 who would lack insurance that year
 under current law.
  Stability of the Health Insurance Market
  Decisions about offering and purchasing health insu
rance depend on the stability of the 
health insurance market
Šthat is, 
on having insurers 
participating
 in most areas of the 
country and 
on 
the likelihood 
of premiums
™ not rising
 in an unsustainable spiral. 
The 
market for insurance purchased individually (
that is,
 nongroup coverage) 
would
 be 
unstable
, for example,
 if the people who want
ed to buy coverage at 
any
 offered price would 
have 
average 
health care expenditures 
so 
high 
that offering 
the
 insurance would be 
unprofitable. In CBO and JCT™s assessment, ho
wever, th
e nongroup
 market would 
probably be stable 
in most areas 
under 
either 
current law
 or 
the legislation
.  
Under current law, most 
subsidized 
enrollees 
purchasing 
health insurance 
coverage in the 
nongroup market 
are largely insulated from 
increases
 in premiums because their 
out-of-pocket payments for
 premiums are based on a percentage of their income
; the 
government pays the difference.
 The subsidies to purchase coverage combined with the 
penalties paid by uninsured people 
stemming from the individu
al mandate 
are anticipated 
to cause sufficient demand for insurance by people with low health care expenditures for 

the market to be stable.
   3 Under the legislation, in the agencies™ view, key factors 
bringing about
 market
 stability 
include subsidies to pur
chase insurance, which would 
maintain
 sufficient demand for 
insurance by people with low health care expenditures, and grants to states
 from the
 Patient 
and State Stability Fund
, which 
would
 reduce the costs to insurers of people with high 
health care expe
nditures. 
Even though the 
new tax credits would be
 structured differently
 from
 the current subsidies and would 
generally
 be less generous
 for those receiving 
subsidies under current law
, the
 other changes 
would
, in the agencies™ view,
 lower 
average 
premium
s enough to attract a sufficient number of
 relatively healthy people to stabilize the 
market
.  Effects on Premiums
  The legislation would tend to increase average premiums in the nongroup
 market prior to 
2020 and lower average premiums thereafter, relative to
 projections under
 current law. 
In 
2018 and 2019, 
according to 
CBO and JCT
™s estimates,
 average premiums 
for single 
policyholders 
in the nongroup market would be 15 
percent 
to 20 perce
nt higher than under 
current law
, mainly because the individual mandate penalties
 would be eliminated
, inducing fewer comparatively
 healthy
 people to sign up
.  Starting in 2020, 
the increase in average premiums from repealing the individual mandate 
penalties would be more than offset by
 the 
combination of several factors that would 
decrease those premiums: grants to 
states 
from 
the 
Patient and 
State 
Stability 
Fund 
(which 
CBO and JCT expect to
 largely
 be used by states to limit the costs to insurers o
f enrollees 
with very high claims
); the eliminati
on of 
the 
requirement for insur
ers to offer
 plans
 cover
ing certain 
percent
ages
 of the cost of covered benefits
; and a younger mix of 
enrollees
. By 2026
, average premiums 
for single policyholders 
in the 
nongroup market 
under the legislation would be 
roughly 
10 
percent 
lower than under current law
, CBO and 
JCT estimate
.  Although 
average premiums would increase prior to 2020 and decrease starting in 2020, 
CBO and JCT estimate that changes in premiums relat
ive to 
those under 
current law would 
differ significantly for people of different
 ages
 because of
 a change in age
-rating rules. 
Under the legislation, insurers would be allowed to generally charge five times more for 

older enrollees than younger ones rathe
r than three times more 
as under current law, 
substantially reducing premiums for young adults and 
substantially 
raising premiums for 
older 
people
.  Uncertainty Surrounding the Estimates
  The ways in which 
federal agencies, 
states, 
insurers, employers, 
individuals, 
doctors, 
hospitals, and other affected parties would respond to the changes made by 
the
 legislation
 are all difficult to predict, so the estimates in this report are uncertain. But CBO and JCT 
 4 have endeavored to develop estimates that are in t
he middle of the distribution of potential 
outcomes.
  Macroeconomic Effects
  Because of the magnitude of its budgetary effects, th
is
 legislation is ﬁmajor legislation,ﬂ as 
defined in the rules of the House of Representatives.
1 Hence, 
it
 triggers the requir
ement 
that the cost estimate, to the greatest extent practicable, include the budgetary impact of
 it
s macroeconomic effects. However, because of the very short time available to prepare this 
cost 
estimate, 
quantifying and incorporating 
those macroeconomic 
effects 
have
 not been 
practicable. 
  Intergovernmental and Private
-Sector 
Mandates
  JCT and 
CBO
 have
 reviewed the 
provisions of the legislation
 and determined that they 
would impose no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform 
Act
 (UMRA)
.  JCT and CBO have determined that the 
legislation
 would impose private
-sector mandates 
as defined in UMRA. 
On the basis of
 information from JCT, CBO estimates the aggregate 
cost of the mandates would exceed the annual threshold established in U
MRA for 
private
-sector mandates ($156 million in 2017, adjusted annually for inflation).
   MAJOR
 PROVISIONS
 OF THE LEGISLATION
  Budgetary effects related to health insurance coverage would 
stem 
primarily from
 the 
following provisions
:   Eliminating penaltie
s associated with the requirements that most people obtain 
health insurance coverage and that large employers offer their employees coverage 
that meets specified standards
.   Reducing
 the 
federal match
ing
 rate
 for 
adults made eligible for Medicaid by the 
ACA to equal 
the 
rate for other enrollees in the state,
 beginning in 
2020
.   Capping the 
growth in 
per
-enrollee payments for most Medicaid 
beneficiaries
 to no 
more than the medical
 care 
component of the consumer price index starting in 2020
.                                                1. Cl. 8 of Rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, H.R. Res. 5, 115
th
 Congress (2017).
  5  Repealing 
current
-law 
subsidies for health insurance coverage obtained through the 
nongroup market
Šwhich include refundable tax credits for premium assistance and 
subsidies to reduce cost
-sharing
 payments
Šas well as the Basic Health Program
, beginning in 2020
.   Crea
ting a new 
refundable 
tax credit for health insurance coverage purchased 
through the nongroup market beginning in 2020
.   Appropriating funding for grants to states through 
the
 Patient and State Stability 
Fund beginning in 2018
.   Relaxing the current
-law re
quirement that 
prevents 
insurers 
from
 charg
ing older 
people
 premiums that are more than 
three
 times larger than 
the 
premiums charged to 
younger
 people
 in the nongroup and small
-group markets. 
Unless a state set
s a 
different limit, t
he 
legislation
 would 
all
ow insurers to 
charge older 
people
 five
 times
 more than younger 
ones
, beginning in 2018
.   Removing the requirement
, beginning in 2020,
 that 
insurers who offer
 plans 
in the 
nongroup and small
-group markets 
generally must offer plans 
that cover at least 
60 percent of the cost of covered benefits
.   Requiring insurers to apply a 30 percent surcharge on premiums for people who 
enroll in insurance in the nongroup or small
-group markets if they have been 
uninsured for more tha
n 63 days within the past year.
  Othe
r parts of the legislation would 
repeal or delay many of the changes the ACA made to 
the Internal Revenue Code that were not directly related to the law™s insurance coverage 
provisions. Those with the largest budgetary effects include
:   Repealing t
he surta
x on certain high
-income taxpayers™ net investment income;
   Repealing t
he increase in the Hospital Insurance payroll tax rate for certain 
high
-income taxpayers; 
   Repealing t
he annual fee on health insurance providers; and
   Delaying when t
he excise tax imposed on some health insurance plans with 
high 
premiums
 would go into effect
.  In addition, the legislation would make several changes to other health
-related programs 
that would have smaller budgetary effects.
   6 ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERA
L GOVERNMENT
  CBO and JCT
 estimate that
, on net,
 enacting the legislation would decrease federal deficits 
by $337
 billion over the 2017
-2026 period
 (see Table 1). T
hat change would result from
 a 
$1.2 tr
illion decrease in direct spending, partially offset 
by an $883 billion reduction in 
revenues.
 
  BASIS OF ESTIMATE
  For this estimate, CBO and JCT assume that the legislation will be enacted by May
 2017.
 Costs and savings are measured relative to CBO™s March 2016 baseline projections, with 
adjustments for le
gislation that was enacted after that baseline was produced.
  
The largest
 budgetary effects 
would 
stem from provisions in the recommendations from 
both committees that would affect insurance coverage. Those provisions
, taken together,
 would reduce
 projecte
d deficits by $935 billion over the 2017
-2026 period. Other 
provisions would increase deficits by 
$599 billion, mostly by reducing tax revenues.
 All 
told, deficits would be reduced by $337 billion over that period, CBO and JCT estimate
. (See Table 
2 for th
e estimated budgetary effects of each major provision
.)  Budgetary Effects of Health Insurance Coverage Provisions
  The $935 billion in estimated deficit reduction 
over the 2017
-2026 period 
that would stem 
from the insurance coverage provisions
 includes the following
 amounts
 (shown in 
Table
 3):   A reduction of $880 billion in 
federal outlays for Medicaid
;   Savings
 of 
$673 billion
, mostly stemming from the elimination of 
the ACA™s 
subsidies
 for nongroup health insurance
Šwhich include refundable t
ax credits for 
premium assistance and s
ubsidies to reduce cost
-sharing payments
Šin 2020
;   Savings of 
$70 bill
ion mostly 
associated with shifts in the mix of taxable and 
nontaxable compensation resulting from net decreases in 
the number of people 

estimated 
to enroll in 
employment
-based health insurance coverage; and
   Savings of $6 billion from the repeal of a tax credit for certain small employers that 
provide health insurance to their employees.
  7 Those decreases 
would be p
artially offset by:
   A cost of $361 billion for 
the
 new tax credit for health insurance
 established by the 
legislation in 2020
;   A reduction in revenues of $2
10 billion from eliminating the penalties paid by 
uninsured people and employers;
   An increase in spending of $80 billion for 
the
 new Patient and State Stability Fund 
grant program; and
   A net
 increase in spending of $4
3 billion
 under the Medicare program
 stemming 
from changes in payments to
 hospitals that serve a disproportionate share 
of 
low
-income patients
.   Methodology.
 The legislation would change the pricing of nongroup insurance and the 
eligibility for and 
the 
amount of subsidies to purchase that insurance. 
It would also 
lead to 
changes in
 Medicaid
 eligibility and per 
capita 
spending
. The legislation™s effects on health 
insurance coverage 
would 
depend in part on how responsive individuals are to changes in 
the prices
, after subsidies,
 they would have to pay
 for 
nongroup insurance;
 on changes in 
their 
eligibility for public cov
erage;
 and on their underlying desire for such insurance. 
Effects on coverage 
would 
also stem from how responsive firms are to changes in those 
post
 subsidy prices and in the attractiveness of other aspects of n
ongroup alternatives to 
employment
-based
 insu
rance.
  To capture those complex interactions, CBO use
s a microsimulation model to estimate 
how rates of coverage and sources of insurance would change as a result of alterations in 

eligibility and subsidies for
Šand thus the net cost of
Švarious insurance options. Based on 
survey data, that model incorporates a wide range of information about a representative 

sample of individuals and families, including their income, employment, health status, and 
health insurance 
coverage. The model also incorporates information from the research 
literature about the responsiveness of individuals and employers to price changes and the 
responsiveness of individuals to changes in eligibility for public coverage. CBO regularly 
updates
 the model so that it incorporates information from the most recent administrative 
data on insurance coverage and premiums. CBO and JCT use that model
Šin combination 
with models of tax revenue
s, models of Medicaid spending
 and actions by states
, projection
s of trends in early retiree
s™ health insurance coverage, and other available 
information
Što inform their estimates of the numbers of people with certain types of 
coverage and the associated federal budgetary costs.

  8 Effects of 
Repeal
ing
 Mandate
 Penalties
. Eliminat
ing the
 penalties associated with t
wo requirements
, while keeping the requirements themselves in place,
 would affect insurance 
coverage in various ways
. Those two requirements are 
that most people obtain health 
insurance coverage
 (also called the 
individual mandate)
 and that large employers offer 
their employees health insurance coverage that meets specified standards
 (also called the 
employer mandate)
. Eliminating the
ir
 associated penalties
 would 
reduce
 federal 
revenues
 starting in 2017
, but 
CBO a
nd JCT estimate that 
doing so
 would 
also 
substantially reduce 
the number of people with health insurance coverage and, accordingly, would reduce the 
costs 
incurred by the federal government in subsidizing
 some
 health insurance coverage. 
The estimated savin
gs stemming from fewer people enrolling in Medicaid,
 in
 health 
insurance obtained 
through
 the nongroup market, and 
in 
employment
-based health 
insurance coverage would exceed the 
estimated 
loss 
of revenues from eliminating 
mandate 
penal
ties
.  CBO and JCT 
estimate that repealing the individual mandate penalt
ies
 would also result in 
higher health insurance premiums in the nongroup market after 2017.
3 Insurers would still 
be required to provide coverage to any applicant, would not be able to vary premiums to 

reflect enrollees™ health status or to limit coverage of preexisting medical conditions, and 
would 
be 
limited 
in how premiums could vary by age
. Those features are most attractive to 
applicants with relatively high expected costs for health care, s
o CBO an
d JCT 
expect that 
repealing the individual mandate penalt
ies
 would tend to reduce insurance coverage less 
among older and less healthy people than among younger and healthier people
. Thus
, the 
agencies estimate that
 repealing those penalties
, taken by itse
lf,
 would increase
 premiums
. Nevertheless, CBO and JCT anticipate that a significant number of relatively healthy 
people would still purchase insurance in the nongroup market because of the availability of 
government subsidies
.  Major Changes to Medicaid. 
CBO estimates that 
several major 
provisions 
affecting 
Medicaid would 
decreas
e 
direct s
pending by $
880 billion over the 2017
-2026 period
. That 
reduction would stem primarily from lower enrollment throughout the period, culminating 
in 14 million fewer Medica
id enrollees by 2026, a reduction of about 
17 percent
 relative to 
the number under current law
. Some of that decline would be among people who are 
currently eligible for Medicaid benefits, and some would be among people who CBO 
projects would be made eligi
ble as a result of state actions in the future under current law 
(that is, from 
additional states 
adopt
ing
 the optional expansion of eligibility authorized by 
the ACA
). Some decline in spending and enrollment would begin immediately, but most of 
the changes would begin in 2020, when the legislation would terminate the enhanced 
federal matching 
rate
 for new enrollees under the ACA™s expansion of Medicaid and would 
place
 a per
 capita
-based cap on the federal government™s payments to states for medical 
                                              3. CBO and JCT 
expect
 that insurers 
would not be able to change their 2017 premiums because those premiums 
have already been set.
  9 assistance provided through Medicaid. By 2026, Medicaid spending would be about 
25 percent less
 than what CBO projects under current law.
  
Changes Before 2020. 
Under current
 law, the penalties associated with the individual 
mandate apply to some Medicaid
-eligible adults and children. (For example, the penalties 
apply to single individuals with income above about 90 percent of the federal poverty 
guidelines, 
also known as the
 federal poverty level, or FPL). CBO estimates that, without 
those penalties, fewer people would enroll in Medicaid, including 
some who are not 
subject to the penalties but might think they are
. Some people might be uncertain about 
what circumstances trigge
r the penalty and others might be uncertain about their annual 
income. 
The estimated lower enrollment would result in less spending for the program. 
Those effects on enrollment and spending would continue throughout the 2017
-2026 
period.
  Termination of En
hanced Federal Match
ing Funds
 for New 
Enrollees From Expanding 
Eligibility for 
Medicaid.
 Under current law, states are permitted
, but not required
, to 
expand eligibility for Medicaid to adults under 65 whose income is equal to or less than 

138 percent of 
the FPL (referred to here as ﬁnewly eligibleﬂ). 
The federal government pays 
a larger share of the medical costs for those 
people
 than it pays for those who 
were 
previously eligible
. Beginning in 2020, the legislation woul
d reduce the federal matching 
rate f
or newly eligible
 adults from 
90 percent
 of medical costs 
to the rate for other enrollees 
in the state. (The federal match
ing
 rate for other enrollees ranges from 50 percent to 
75 percent, depending on the state, with an average of about 57 percent.) 
The l
ower federal 
matching rate would apply only to those newly enrolled after December 31, 2019.
  The 
31 states and the District of Columbia
 that have already expanded Medicaid to the 
newly eligible cover roughly half of that population nationwide. CBO project
s that under 
current law, additional states will expand their Medicaid programs and that, by 2026, 
roughly 80
 percent of newly eligible people will reside in states that have done so. Under 
the legislation, largely b
ecause 
states 
would pay for a 
great
er share of 
enrollees™
 costs, 
CBO expects
 that
 no additional
 states would expand eligibility, thereby reducing both 
enrollment in and spending for Medicaid. 
According to CBO™s estimates, t
hat effect would 
be modest in the near 
term, but by 2026,
 on an aver
age annual basis, 5 million fewer people 
would be enrolled in Medicaid than would have been enrolled under current law 
(see 
Figure
 1).
  
CBO
 also 
anticipate
s some
 states that have already 
expand
ed
 their Medicaid programs 
would no longer offer that coverage,
 reducing the share of the newly eligible population 
residing in a state with expanded eligibility to about 30 percent in 2026. That estimate 

reflects different possible outcomes without any explicit prediction about which states 
would make which choices. 
In considering the possible outcomes, CBO took into account 
several factors: the extent of optional coverage provided to the newly eligible population 
and other groups before the ACA™s enactment (as a measure of a state™s willingness to 
 10 provide cov
erage ab
ove statutory minimums),
 states™ ability to b
ear costs under the 
legislation,
 and potential methods to mitigate those costs (such as changes to benefit 
packages and payment rates). 
Some states might also begin to take action prior to 2020 in 
anticipation o
f future changes 
that would result from
 the legislation to avoid abrupt 
changes to eligibility and other program features. 
How individual states would ultimately 

respond is highl
y uncertain.
  Because the lower federal matching rate would apply only to thos
e newly enrolled after 
December
 31, 2019 (or who experience a break in eligibility after that date), CBO 
estimates that reductions in spending for the newly eligible would increase over several 
years, as ﬁgrandfatheredﬂ enrollees
 would
 cycle off the progra
m and 
be replaced by new 
enrollees. On the basis of historical data (and taking into account the increased frequency 
of eligibility redeterminations required by the legislation), CBO projects that fewer than 
one-third of those enrolled as of December 31, 2
019, would have maintained continuous 
eligibility two years later. 
Under the legislation, t
he higher federal matching rate would 
apply for fewer than 5
 percent of newly eligible enrollees by the end of 2024, CBO 
estimates.
  Per Capita
-Based Cap on Medicaid
 Payments for Medical Assistance. 
Under current law, 
the federal 
government 
and state governments share in the financing a
nd administration of 
Medicaid. 
In general, states pay health care providers for services to enrollees
, and the 
federal governmen
t reim
burses states for a
 percent
age
 of their expenditur
es
. All federal 
reimbursement for medical services is open
-ended, meaning that if a state spends more 
because enrollment increases or costs per enrollee rise, additional federal paymen
ts are 
automatically g
enerated.
  Under the legislation, b
eginning in 2020, the federal government would establish a limit on 
the amount of reimbursement it provides to states. 
That
 limit would be 
set by calculat
ing
 the average 
per
-enrollee 
cost of medical services for most enrollees who received full 
Medicaid benefits in 2016 for each state. The Secretary
 of Health and Human Services
 wou
ld then inflate the average per
-enrollee costs for each state by the growth in the 
consumer 
price 
index for 
medical
 care
 services (CPI
-M). The final limit on federal 
reimbursement for each state for 2020 and after would be the average cost per enrollee for 
five specified groups of enrollees (the elderly, disabled
 people
, children, 
newly eligible 
adults, and all other adults)
, reflecting growth in the
 CPI
-M from 2016 
multiplied by the 
number of enrollees in each category in that year. If a state spen
t more than the limit on 
federal reimbursement, the federal government would provide 
no 
add
itional fu
nding to 
match that spending.
  
The limit on federal reimbursement would reduce outlays because
 (after the changes to the 
Medicaid expansion population 
have been
 accounted for
) Medicaid spending
 would 
grow 
on a per
-enrollee basis at a faster rate than 
the 
CPI-M, according to CBO™s projections:
 at 
an average annual rate of 
4.4 percent
 for Medicaid and
 3.7 percent for
 the
 CPI
-M over the 
 11 2017
-2026 period
. With less
 federal reimbursement for Medicaid, 
states
 would need to 
decide whether to commit more of their o
wn 
resources
 to finance the program 
at 
current
-law levels 
or whether to reduce spending by cutting payments to health care 
providers and health plans, eliminating optional services, restricting eligibility for 
enrollment, or (to the extent feasible) arrivi
ng at more efficient methods for delivering 
services. CBO anticipates that states would adopt a mix of th
ose approaches
, which would 
result in additional savings to the federal government.
 (Other provisions affecting 
Medicaid are discussed below.
)  Changes to Subsidies and Market Rules for Nongroup Health Insurance Before 2020. 
Under the legislation, existing subsidies for health insurance coverage purchased in the 
nongroup market would largely remain in effect until 2020
Šbut the premium tax credits 
would 
differ by 
the 
age of the individual 
in 2019. 
Aside from the changes in enrollment and 
premiums as a result of eliminati
ng the individual mandate pe
nalties (mentioned earlier),
 th
e other changes discussed in this section 
would have small effects on co
verage and 
federal subsidies in the nongroup market.
  Nongroup Market Subsidies.
 Subsidies under current law fall into two categories: subsidies 
to cover a portion of participants™ health insurance premiums (which take the form of 

refundable tax credits) a
nd subsidies to reduce their cost
-sharing amounts (out
-of-pocket 
payments required under insurance policies). The first category of subsidies, also called 

premium tax credits, is generally available to people with income between 100 percent and 
400 percent
 of the FPL, with certain exceptions. The second category, also called 
cost
-sharing subsidies, is available to those who are eligible for premium tax credits, 
generally have a household income between 100 percent and 250 percent of the FPL, and 
enro
ll in a
n eligible plan.
  Under current law, those subsidies can be obtained only by purchasing nongroup coverage 
through a health insurance marketplace. Under the legislation, premium tax credits
Šbut 
not cost
-sharing 
subsidies
Šwould also be available for 
most 
plans purchased in the 
nongroup market outside of marketplaces beginning in 2018. However, the tax credits for 
those plans could not be advanced and could only be claimed on a person™s tax return. CBO 
and JCT esti
mate that roughly 2 million people
 who are expected to enroll
 in plans 
purchased in the nongroup market outside of marketplaces in 2018 and 2019 
under current 

law 
would newly receive premium tax credits for that coverage
 under the legislation
.  The premium
 tax credits would 
differ by 
the 
age of the individual 
for one year in 2019, 
while cost
-sharing subsidies would remain unchanged prior to 2020. For those with 
household income exceeding 150 percent of the FPL, the legislation would generally 
reduce the per
centage of income that younger people had to pay toward their premiums and 
increase that percentage for older people.
4 CBO and JCT expect that roughly 1 million 
                                              4. For 
families
, the age of the oldest taxpayer would be used to determine 
the age
-adjusted percentage of income that 
must be paid toward the premium
s. As under current law, the premium tax credits would cover the amount by 
  12 more people would enroll in coverage obtained through the nongroup market as a result of 
the ch
ange in the structure of premium tax credits. That increase would be the net result of 
higher 
enrollment among younger people and lower
 enrollment among older people.
  Patient and State Stability Fund Grants. 
Beginning in 2018
 and ending after 2026
, the 
federal government would make
 a total of
 $100 billion in 
allotments to states that they 
could use for a variety of purposes, including reducing premiums for insurance in the 
nongroup market. 
CBO and JCT estimate that federal outlays for grants from the Pat
ient 
and Stat
e Stability Fund would total $80
 billion over the 2018
-2026 period.
  By t
he agencies
™ estimate
s, 
the grants would reduce premiums for insurance in the 
nongroup market in many states.
 CBO and JCT expect that 
states would use 
those grants 
mostly
 to reimburse insurers for some of the costs of enrollees with claims above a 
threshold.
 For states that did not develop plans to spend the funds, the federal government 
would make payments to insurers in the individual market 
who have
 enrollees with 
relat
ively high claims. 
Before 2020, CBO expects, the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services would make payments to insurers on the behalf of most states because most would 
not have enough time to set up their own programs before insurers had to set premiums fo
r 2018. As a result, CBO estimates that most states would rely on the federal default program 

for one or more years until they had more time t
o establish their own programs.
  
Continuous Coverage Provisions
. Insurers would be required to impose a penalty
 on people who enroll
ed
 in insurance in the nongroup or small
-group markets if they 
had been 
uninsur
ed for more than 63 days within the past year
. When they purchase
d insurance in 
the nongroup or small
-group market, they would be sub
ject to a surcharge equal 
to 
30 percent of their monthly premium for up to 12 months. The requirement would apply to 
people enrolling during a special enrollment period in 2018 and, beginning in 2019, to 

people enrolling at any time during the year.
  
CBO and JCT expect that increas
ing the 
future 
price of insurance through the surcharge for 
people who do not have continuous coverage would increase the number of people with 
insurance in 2018 and reduce that number in 2019 and later years. By the agencies™ 
estimates, roughly 1 million 
people would be induced to purchase insurance in 2018 to 
avoid possibly having to pay the surcharge in the future. In most years after 2018, however, 

roughly 2
 million fewer people would purchase insurance because they would either have 
to pay the surcharg
e or provide documentation about previous health insurance coverage. 
The people deterred from purchasing coverage 
would tend to be healthier than
 those who 
would not be deterred and would
 be willing to
 pay the surcharge.
                                                                                                                                                   which the reference premium
Šthat is, the premium for the second
-lowest
-cost ﬁsilverﬂ plan that covers the 
eligible people in the household in the area in which they reside
Šexceeds that percentage of income. 
A silver 
plan covers about 70 percent of the costs of covered benefits
.  13 Age Rat
ing Rules
. Beginning in 2018, the legislation would expand the limits on how
 much
 insurers 
in the nongroup and small
-group markets 
can vary premiums on the basis of age. 
However, CBO and JCT expect that the provision could not be implemented until 2019
 because 
there
 would be insufficient time for the federal government, states, and insurers to 
incorporate the changes 
and then
 set premiums for 2018
. Under current law, a 64
-year
-old 
can
 generally
 be charged premiums that cost up to three times as much as those offered 
to a 
21-year
-old. Under the legislation, that allowable difference would shift to five times as 
much unless a state chose otherwise. That 
change 
would tend to reduce premiums for 
younger people and incr
ease premiums for older people.
  However, CBO and JCT 
estimate that the structure of the premium tax credits before 2020 
would limit how changes in age rating rules affected the number of people who 
would 
enroll in health insurance coverage 
in
 the nongroup market. People eligible for subsidies in 
the nongroup
 market are now largely insulated from changes in premiums: A person 
receiving a premium tax credit pays a certain percentage of his or her income toward the 

reference premium, and the tax credit covers the difference between the premium and that 
percentag
e of income. Consequently, despite the 
changes 
in premiums for 
younger and 
older people, the person™s out
-of-pocket payments would not be affected much. Therefore, 
CBO and JCT estimate that the increase in the number of people enrolled in coverage 
through 
the nongroup market as a result of changes in age rating rules would be 
less
 than 
500,000
 in 2019
 and would be the net result of higher enrollment among younger people 
and lower enrollment among older people
. The small increase 
would mostly stem from net 
changes in enrollment among people 
who had
 income high enough to be ineligible for 
subsidies and who would 
face
 substantial changes in out
-of-pocket payments for 
premiums.
  Changes to Subsidies and Market Rules for Nongroup Health Insurance Beginning 
in 202
0. Beginning in 2020, the current premium tax credits and cost
-sharing subsidies 
would both be repealed.
 That same year, the legislation would create new refundable tax 
credits for insurance purchased in the nongroup market. In addition to making the marke
t 
changes discussed thus far (eliminating mandate penalties, providing grants to states to 
help stabilize the nongroup market, establishing a requirement for continuous coverage, 
and changing the age rating rules), the legislation would relax the current r
equirements 
about the share of benefits that must be cove
red by a health insurance plan.
  Many rules governing the nongroup market would remain in effect as under current law. 
For example, insurers would be required to 
accept all applicants during s
pecified 
open
-enrollment periods
, could
 not vary people™s premiums on the basis of their health, 
and 
could
 not restrict coverage of enrollees™ preexisting health conditions. Insurers 
would
 also
 still
 be required to 
cover specified categories of health care
 services
, and the amount o
f costs for covered services that enrollees
 have to 
pay out
 of pocket
 would remain limited to 
a specified threshold
. Prohibitions on annual and lifetime maximum benefits would still 
apply. Also, the risk adjustment program
Šwhich 
transfers
 funds from plans
 that
 attract a 
 14 relatively small proportion of high
-risk enrollees (people with serious chronic conditions, 
for example) to plans that attract a relatively large proportion of such people
Šwould 
remain in place.
  Because the new ta
x credits are designed primarily to be paid in advance on behalf of 
enrollees to insurers, procedures 
would
 need to be in place to enable the Internal Revenue 
Service and the Department of Health and Human Services to verify that the credits 
were
 being p
ai
d to eligible insurers who were
 offering qualified insurance as defined under 
federal and state law on behalf of eligible enrollees. 
CBO and JCT™s 
estimates 
reflect an 
assum
ption that adequate resources would
 be made available 
through future appropriations
 to th
ose executive branch
 agencies to ensure that such systems 
were
 put in place in a timely 
manner. To the extent that they 
were
 not, enrollment and compliance could be negatively 
affected.
  Changes to 
Actuarial Value Requirements.
 Actuarial value is the
 percentage of total costs 
for covered benefits that the plan pays when covering a standard population. 
Under current 
law, most plans in the nongroup and small
-group markets must have an actuarial value that 
is in one of four tiers: 
about 60 percent, 70 pe
rcent, 80 percent, or 90 percent. Beginning in 
2020, the legislation would repeal those requirements, potentially allowing plans to have 
an actuarial value below 60 percent. However, plans would still be required to cover 10 
categories of health benefits t
hat are defined as ﬁessentialﬂ under current law,
 and
 the total 
annual out
-of-pocket costs for an enrollee would remain
 capped. 
In CBO and JCT™s 
estimation, complying with those two requirements would significantly limit the ability of 
insurers to design 
plans with an actuarial value much below 60 percent.
  Nevertheless, CBO and JCT estimate that repealing the actuarial value requirements would 
lower the actuarial value 
of plans in the nongroup market
 on average. The requirement that 
insurers offer both a 
plan with an actuarial value of 70 percent and one with an actuarial 
value of 80
 percent in order to participate in the marketplace would no longer apply under 
the legislation. As a result, an insurer could choose to sell only plans with lower actuarial 
values. Many insurers would find that option attractive 
because they could offer a plan 
priced closer to the amount of the premium tax credit so that a younger person would have 
low out
-of-pocket costs for premiums and 
would 
be more likely to enroll. Insurer
s might be 
less likely to offer plans with high actuarial values out of a fear of attracting a greater 
proportion of less healthy enrollees to those plans, although the availability of the Patient 
and State Stability Fund grants in most states would reduce
 that risk. The continuation of 
the risk adjustment program
 could also help limit insurers™ costs from high
-risk enrollees.
  Because of plans™ lower average actuarial values, CBO and JCT expect that individuals™ 
cost
-sharing payments, including deductibles
, in the nongroup market would tend to be 
higher than those anticipated under current law. In addition, cost
-sharing subsidies would 
be repealed in 2020, significantly increasing out
-of-pocket costs for nongroup insurance 
for many lower
-income enrollees.
 The higher costs 
would make the plans less attractive 
 15 than th
ose
 available under current law to many potential enrollees, especially 
people who 
are eligible for the largest subsidies under current law
.  Changes in the Way
s the Nongroup Market 
Would Function
. Under the legislation, some of 
the ways that the nongroup market functions would change for consumers. 
The current 

actuarial value requirements help people compare different insurance plans, because all 
plans in a tier cover the same share of costs, on a
verage. CBO and JCT expect that
, under 
the legislation
, plans 
would be harder to compare
, making shopping for a plan on the basis 
of price more difficult.
  Another feature of the nongroup market under current law is that there is one central 
website throug
h the state or federal marketplace where people can shop for all the plans in 
their area that are eligible for subsidies. Under the legislation, insurers participating in the 
nongroup market would no longer have to offer plans through the marketplace
s in o
rder for 
people to receive subsidies toward those plans; therefore, CBO and JCT estimate that 
fewer would do so. With more plans that are eligible for subsidies offered directly from 
insurers or directly through agents and brokers and not through the marke
tplaces™ central 
websites, shopping for and comparing plans could be harder
, depending on insurers™ 
decisions
 about how to market their plans
.  Changes 
in
 Nongroup Market Subsidies
. With the repeal in 2020 of the current premium 
tax credits and the cost
-sharing subsidies, different refundable tax credits for insurance 
purchased in the nongroup market would become available.
5 The new tax credits would 
vary on the basis of age
 by a factor of 2 to 1
: Someone age 60 
or older 
would be eligible for 
a tax credit 
of $4,000
, while
 someone 
younger than age 30
 would be 
eligible for
 a tax 
credit
 of 
$2,000.
 People would generally be eligible for the full amount of the tax credit if their 
adjusted gross income was below $75,000 for a single tax filer and below $150,000 f
or 
joint filers and if they were not eligible for certain other types of insurance coverage.
6 The 
credits would phase out for people with income above those thresholds. The tax credits 

would be refundable if the size of the credit exceeded a person™s tax l
iability
. They could 
also
 be advanced to insurers on a monthly basis throughout the year on behalf of an 
enrollee. Finally, tax credits could be used for
 most
 health insurance plans purchased 
through a marketplace or directly from an insurer.
 
 Under curren
t law, the
 size of the premium tax credit
 depends on household income and the 
reference premium in 
an
 enrollee
™s rating area. 
The enrollee pays a certain percentage of 
his or her
 income toward the reference premium
, and the size of the subsidy varies by 
                                              5. People would also be able to use the new tax credits toward unsubsidized of continua
tion coverage under the 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).
 6. The tax credits and the income thresholds would both be indexed
 each year
 by the consumer price index for all 
urban consumers plus 
1 percentage point.
  16 geography and age for a given income level. In that way, the enrollee is insulated from 
variations in premiums by geography and is also 
largely 
insulated from increases in 
the 
reference premium
. An enrollee 
would pay the difference between the reference prem
ium 
and the premium for the plan he or she chose, 
providing some 
incentive to choose 
lower
-priced insurance
. Beginning in 2020, under the legislation, the size of a premium tax 
credit would vary with age, rather than with income (except for people with inc
ome in the 
phase
-out range) or the amount of the premium. The enrollee would be responsible for any 
premium above the credit amount. That structure would provide
 greater
 incentives for 
enrollees to choose lower
-priced insurance and would mean that people l
iving in high
-cost 
areas would be responsible for a larger share of the premium.
  Under the legislation, some people would be eligible for smaller subsidies than those under 
current law
, and others would be eligible for larger ones. As a result, by CBO and
 JCT™s 
estimates, the composition of the population purchasing health insurance in the nongroup 

market under the legislation would differ significantly from that under current law, 

particularly by income and age.
  For many lower
-income people, t
he 
new tax 
credits under the legislation would tend to be 
smaller than the premium tax credits under current law.
7 In an illustrative example, CBO 
and JCT estimate that a 21
-year
-old with income at 175
 percent of the FPL in 2026 would 
be eligible for a premium tax cr
edit of about $3,400 under current law; the tax credit would 

fall to about $2,45
0 under the legislation (see Table
 4). In addition, because cost
-sharing 
subsidies would be eliminated under the legislation, lower
-income people™s share of 
medical services pa
id in the form of deductibles and other cost sharing would increase. As 
a result, CBO and JCT estimate, fewer lower
-income people would obtain coverage 
through the nongroup market under the legi
slation than under current law.
  
Conversely, the tax credits under the legislation would tend to be larger than current
-law 
premium tax credits for many people with higher income
Šparticularly for those with 
income above 400 percent of the FPL but below the income 
cap
 for a full credit, wh
ich is 
set by the legislation at $75,000 for a single tax filer and $150,000 for joint filers in 2020. 
For example, CBO and JCT estimate that a 21
-year
-old with income at 450
 percent of the 
FPL in 2026 would be ineligible for a credit under current law but
 newly eligible
 for a tax 
credit of about $2,45
0 under the legislation. Lower out
-of-pocket payments toward 
premiums would tend to increase enrollment in the nongroup market among higher
-income 
people.
  Enacting the legislation would also result in signifi
cant changes in the size of subsidies in 
the nongroup market according to people™s age. For example, CBO and JCT estimate that a 
                                              7. People with incom
e below 100 percent of the FPL who are ineligible for Medicaid and meet other eligibility 
criteria would become newly eligible for a premium tax credit under the legislation.
  17 21-year
-old, 40
-year
-old, and 64
-year
-old with income at 175 percent of the FPL
 in 2026
 would all pay roughly $1,700 toward their reference premium under current law, even 
though the reference premium for a 64
-year
-old is three times larger than that for a 
21-year
-old in most states. Under the legislation, premiums for older people could be 
five 
times larger than those for younger people in many states, but the size of the tax credits for 
older people would only be twice the size of the credits for younger people. Because of that 
difference in how much the tax credits would cover, CBO and JCT
 estimate that, under the 
legislation, a larger share of enrollees in the nongroup market would be younger people and 
a smaller share would be older people.
  
According to CBO and JCT™s estimates, 
total 
federal subsidies for nongroup health 
insurance would 
be significantly smaller under the legislation than under current law for 
two reasons. First, by the agencies™ projections, fewer people, on net, would obtain 
coverage in the nongroup health insurance market under the legislation. Second, the 
average subsi
dy per subsidized enrollee under the legislation would be significantly lower 
than the average subsidy under current law. In 2020, CBO and JCT estimate
, the average 
subsidy under the legislation would be about 60 percent of the average subsidy under 

curren
t law. In addition, the average subsidy would grow more slowly under the legislation 
than under current law. That difference results from the fact that subsidies under current 

law tend to grow with insurance premiums, whereas subsidies under the legislatio
n would 
grow more slowly, with 
the consumer price index for all urban consumers plus 

1 percentage point
. By 2026, CBO and JCT estimate that the average subsidy under the 
legislation would be about 50 percent of the average subsidy under current law.
 
 Patie
nt and State Stability Fund Grants. 
As a condition of the grants, beginning in 2020, 
states would be required to provide matching funds, which would 
generally 
increase from 
7 percent of the federal funds provided in 2020 to 50 percent of the federal funds 
provided 
in 2026.
 The agencies expect that the grants™ effects
 on premiums after 2020
 would be 
limited by the share of states that 
took
 action and decide
d to pay the required match
ing 
funds
 in order to receive federal money and by the 
extent to which state
s chose to us
e the 
money for purposes that did
 not directly help to lower premiums in the nongroup market.
 Nevertheless, CBO and JCT estimate that the grants would 
exert substantial downward 

pressure on 
premiums in the nongroup market in 2020 and later yea
rs and would help 
encourage participation in the market by insurers.
  Effects of 
Changes 
in the Nongroup Market o
n Employer
s™ Decisions to Offer Coverage
. CBO and JCT estimate that
, over time,
 fewer employers would offer health insurance 
because the legisl
ation would change their incentives to do so. First, the mandate penalties 
would be eliminated. Second, the tax credits under the legislation, for which people would 
be ineligible if they had any offer of employment
-based insurance, 
would be available to 
people with a broader range of incomes than the current tax credits
 are
. That
 change
 could 
make nongroup 
coverage more attractive to a larger share of
 employees
. Consequently, in 
CBO and JCT™s estimation, some employers would choose not to offer coverage a
nd  18 instead increase other forms of compensation in the belief that nongroup insurance was a 
close substitute for employment
-based coverage for their employees.
  
However, two factors would partially offset employers™ incentives not to offer insurance. 
First
, the average subsidy for those who are eligible would be smaller under the legislation 
than under current law and would grow more slowly than health care costs over time. 
Second, CBO and JCT anticipate, nongroup insurance under the legislation would 
be le
ss attractive to many people with employment
-based coverage than under current law
 because nongroup insurance under the legislation would cover a small
er
 share of enrollees
™ expenses, on average, and 
because 
shopping for and comparing plans would 
probably
 be more difficult.
 In general, CBO and JCT expect that businesses that decided not to offer 
insurance coverage under the legislation would have, on average, younger and 

higher
-income workforces than businesses that choose not to offer insurance under curre
nt 
law.
 
 
CBO and JCT expect that employers would adapt slowly to the legislation. Some 
employers would probably delay making decisions because of uncertainty about the 
viability of and regulations for the nongroup market and about implementation of the new
 law.
  Market Stability.
 CBO and JCT anticipate that
, under the legislation, 
the combination of 
subsidies to purchase nongroup insurance and rules regulating the market 
would
 result in a 
relatively 
stable nongroup market
. That is, 
most areas of the country
 would have insurers 
participating
 in the nongroup market, and 
the market would not be subject to an 
unsustainable spiral of rising premiums. 
First and m
ost important, a substantial number of 
relatively healthy (mostly young) people would 
continue
 to purch
ase insurance in the 
nongroup market because of the availability of government subsidies. Second, 
grants from 
the Patient and State Stability Fund would help stabilize premiums and reduce potential 
losses to insurers from enrollees with very large claims. 
Finally, 
in CBO and JCT™s 
judgment, 
the 
risk 
adjustment 
program 
would
 help protect insurers from losses arising 
from high
-risk enrollees
. The agencies expect that a
ll of those factors would encourage 
insurers to continue to participate in the nongroup mark
et.
  However, significant changes in nongroup subsidies and market rules would occur each 

year for the first three years following enactment, which might cause uncertainty for 
insurers in setting premiums. As a result of the elimination of 
the 
individual m
andate 
penalties, CBO and JCT project that nongroup enrollment in 2018 would be smaller than 

that in 2017 and that the average health status of enrollees would worsen. A small share of 
that decline in enrollment would be offset by the onetime effect of the
 continuous coverage 
provisions, which would somewhat increase enrollment in the nongroup market in 2018 as 
people anticipated potential surcharges in 2019. Grants from the Patient and State Stability 
Fund would begin to take
 effect in 2018 
to help 
mitigate losses
 and encourage participation 
by insurers
.  19 The mix of enrollees in 2019 would differ from that in 2018, because the change to 
age
-rating rules would allow older adults to be charged five times as much as younger 
adults
 in many states
. In addition, there would be a one
-year change to the premium tax 
credits, which CBO and JCT expect would somewhat increase enrollment among younger 
adults and decrease enrollment among older adults. 
Although t
he combined effect of those 
two changes would
 reduce
 the
 average
 age and
 improve the
 average 
health of enrollees
 in 
the nongroup market, 
it
 might be
 difficult for insurers to set premiums for 2019 using their 
prior 
experience in the market.
  In 2020, CBO estimates
, grants 
to states 
from the Patient a
nd State Stability Fund, once 
fully implemented, would significantly reduce premiums in the nongroup market and 
encourage participation by insurers. The grants would help to reduce the risk to insurers of 
offering nongroup insurance. As a result, CBO expec
ts that those grants would contribute 
substantially to the stability of the nongroup market.
  
That 
effect 
would occur despite the fact that
 more major changes tak
ing effect in 
that year
 would make it difficult for insurers to predict the mix of enrollees o
n the basis of their 
recent experience. T
he new age
-based tax credits would be introduced
 in 2020
 and 
actuarial value requirements would be eliminated. In response, insurers 
would have the 

flexibility
 to sell diff
erent types of plans than they 
do under cur
rent law. The nongroup 
market is expected to be smaller in 2020 than in 2019 but then 
is expected 
to grow 

some
what over the 2020
-2026 period.
  
Other Budgetary Effects of Health Insurance Coverage Provisions. 
Because the 
insurance coverage provisions of the
 legislation would increase the number of uninsured 
people and decrease the number of people with Medicaid coverage relative to the numbers 

under current law, CBO estimates that Medicare 
spending
 would increase by $43 billion 
over the 2018
-2026 period.
  Medicare makes additional ﬁdisproportionate 
share hospitalﬂ
 payments to 
facilities
 that 
serve a higher percentage of uninsured patients.
 Those
 payments have two components: an 
increase to the payment rate for each inpatient case and a lump
-sum allocation of a pool of 
funds based on each qualifying hospital™s share of the 
days of care provided to 

beneficiaries of Supplemental Security Income
 and 
Medicaid.
  Under 
the legislation
, the decreased enrollment in Medicaid would slightly reduce 
the 
amounts paid to hospitals
, CBO estimates.
 However, the 
increase in the number of 
uninsured people would substantially boost the 
amounts distributed on a lump
-sum basis
.  Net Effects on Health Insurance Coverage
  CBO and JCT expect
 that 
under the legislation,
 the number of people without health 
insurance
 coverage would increase but that the increase would be limited initially, because
  20 insurers have already set th
eir premiums for the
 current year
 and many people have already 
made
 their enrollment decisions for the year. 
However, in 2017, the 
elimination of the 
individual mandate penalt
ies
 would result in
 about 4 million additional people 
becoming
 uninsured (see Tab
le 5).
  In 2018
, by CBO and
 JCT™s estimates, about 
14 million more 
people would be
 uninsured
, relative to 
the number under 
current law
. That increase would consist of about 
6 million 
fewer people with
 coverage obtained in the nongroup market, roughly
 5 million fewer 
people with coverage under Medicaid,
 and about 
2 million fewer people with 
employment
-based
 coverage.
 In 2019, the number of uninsured would grow to 16 million 
people because of further reductions in Medicaid and nongroup coverage. Most of t
he 
reductions in coverage in 2018 and 2019 would stem from repealing the penalties 
associated with the individual mandate. 
Some of those people would choose not to have 
insurance because
 they choose to be covered by insurance
 under current law
 only
 to avoi
d paying the penalties
. And some people would forgo insurance in response to higher 
premiums. 
CBO and JCT estimate that
, in total,
 41 million people
 under age 65
 would be 
uninsured in 2018
 and 43 million people 
under age 65 
would be uninsured in 2019
.  In 
2020, according to CBO and JCT™s estimates, as a result of the insurance coverage 
provisions of the legislation, 21 million more nonelderly people in the United States would 
be without health insurance than under current law. By 2026, t
hat number would tot
al 
24 million, CBO and JCT estimate. Specifically:
   Roughly 9 million fewer people would enroll in Medicaid in 2020; that figure would 
rise to 14 
million in 2026
, as s
tates
 that expanded eligibility for 
Medicaid
 discontinued doing so,
 as states projected to expand Medicaid in the future chose 
not to do so, 
and 
as the cap on 
per
-enrollee spending
 took effect
.   Roughly 9 million fewer people, on net, would obtain coverage through the 
nongroup market in 2020; that number would fall to 2 mi
llion in 2026. The 
reduction in enrollment in the nongroup market would shrink over the 2020
-2026 
period because people would gain experience with the new structure of the tax 

credits and some employers would respond to 
those tax credits
 by declining to of
fer 
insurance to their employees.
   Roughly 2 million fewer people, on net, would enroll in employment
-based 
coverage in 2020
, and that number would grow to roughly 7 million in 2026. Part of 
that net reduction in employment
-based coverage would occur becau
se fewer 
employees would take up the offer of such coverage in the absence o
f the individual 
mandate penalties
. In addition, CBO and JCT expect that, over time, fewer 
employers would offer health insurance to their workers.
   21 CBO and JCT estimate that 
48 million people
 under age 65
, or roughly 17 percent of the 
nonelderly population, would be uninsured in 2020 if the legislation was enacted. That 
figure would grow to 52 million, or roughly 19 percent of the nonelderly population, in 
2026. (That figure is 
currently about 10 percent and is projected to remain at that level in 
each year through 2026 under current law
.) Although the agencies expect that the 
legislation would increase the number of uninsured broadly, the increase would be 
disproportionately larg
er among older people with lower income; in particular, people 
betwee
n 50 and 64 years old with income of less than 2
00 percent of the FPL would make 
up a larger share of the uninsured
 (see Figure 2)
.  Net 
Effects on Health Insurance Premiums
  The legislat
ion would tend to increase average premiums in the nongroup market prior to 
2020 and lower average premiums thereafter, relative to 
the outcomes under 
current law. 

(This discussion is focused on premiums before any applicable tax credits
 and before any 
sur
charges for not maintaining continuous coverage
.)  
In 2018 and 2019, according to CBO and JCT™s estimates, average premiums 
for single 
policyholders 
in the nongroup market would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher than under 
current law mainly because of th
e elimination of the individual mandate penalties. 
Eliminating those penalties would markedly reduce enrollment in the nongroup market and 
increase the share of enrollees who would be less healthy. CBO and JCT expect that grants 
from the Patient and State 
Stability Fund would largely be used for reinsurance programs, 
particularly in 2018 and 2019
, when many states would rely on the federal default before 
establish
ing
 their own programs and, as explained earlier, that those payments would help 
lower premiums
 in the nongroup market. The agencies 
estimate
 that program would have a 
relatively small effect on premiums in 2018 because there would not be much time 

between enactment of the legislation and insurers™ deadlines for setting premiums for 
2018. By 2019, h
owever, 
in 
CBO and JCT
™s judgment,
 the Patient and State Stability Fund 
would have the effect of somewhat moderating the increases in average premiums in the 
nongroup market resulting from the legislation.
  Starting in 2020, 
the increase in average premium
s from repealing the individual mandate 
penalties would be more than offset by
 the 
combination of three main factors
. First, the mix 
of people enrolled in coverage obtained in the nongroup market is anticipated to be 

younger, on average, than the mix under
 current law. Second, premiums, on average, are 
estimated to fall 
because 
of the elimination of actuarial value requirements
, which would 
result in plans that cover a lower share of health care costs
, on average
. Third, reinsurance 
programs supported by the Patient and State Stability Fund 
are estimated to
 reduce 
premiums. If 
those
 funds were devoted to other purposes, then premium reductions would 
be smaller.
 By 2026, average premiums 
for single policyholders 
in
 the nongroup market 
under the 
legislation would be roughly 10
 percent lower than the estimates under current 
law.
  22 The changes in premiums would vary for people of different ages. The change in age
-rating 
rules, effective in 2019, would directly change the
 premiums faced by different age groups, 
substantially reducing premiums for young adults and raising premiums for older people. 
By 2026, CBO and JCT project, premiums in the nongroup market would be 20
 percent to 
25 percent lower for a 21
-year
-old and 8 p
ercent to 10 percent lower for a 40
-year
-old
Šbut 
20 percent to 25 percent higher for a 64
-year
-old. 
  Revenue
 Effects of Other Provisions
  JCT estimates that the legislation would reduce revenues by $592 billion 
over the 
2017
-2026 period 
as a result of 
provisions that would repeal many of the revenue
-related 
provisions of the ACA (apart from provisions related to health insurance coverage 
discussed above).
 Those with the most significant budgetary effects include 
an increase in 
the 
Hospital Insurance pay
roll tax rate for high
-income taxpayers, a surtax on those 
taxpayers™ net investment income, and annual fees
 imposed
 on health insurers.
8  Direct Spending
 Effects of Other Provisions
  The legislation would also make changes to spending for other federal he
alth care 
programs. 
CBO and JCT estimate that 
those provisions 
would 
increase direct spending by 
about 
$7 billion over the 2017
-2026 period.
  Prevention and Public Health Fund.
 The
 legislation would, beginning in fiscal year 
2019, repeal the provision that established the Prevention and Public Health Fund and 

rescind all unobligated balances. The Department of Health and Human Services awards 
grants 
through
 the fund to public and pr
ivate entities to carry out prevention, wellness, and 
public health activities. 
Funding under current law is projected to be $1 billion 
in 2017
 and 
to rise 
to 
$2 billion 
in 2025 and each year thereafter
. CBO estimates that eliminating that 
funding woul
d re
duce direct spending by $9
 billion over the 2017
-2026 period.
  Community Health Center Program.
 The legislation would increase the funds available 
to the Community Health Center Program
, which provides grant funds to health centers 
that offer primary and p
reventive care to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Under 
current law
, the program will 
receive about $4
 billion in fiscal year 2017. The legislation 
would increase funding for the program by $
422
 million in fiscal year 201
7. CBO 
estimates that 
implementing the provision would increase direct spending by $
422
 million 
over the 2017
-2026 period.
                                                8. JCT published 10
 documents (JCX
-7-17 through JCX
-16-17) on March 7, 2017
, relatin
g to the legislation. For 
more information, see 
www.jct.gov/publications.html
. 
  23 Provision Affecting Planned Parenthood
. For a one
-year period following enactment, 
the legislation would prevent
 federal funds from being made available t
o an entity 
(includ
ing
 its affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, and clinics) 
if it is:
   A nonprofit organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue 
Code and exempt from tax un
der section 501(a) of the code;
   An essential community prov
ider that is primarily engaged in providing family 
planning and reproductive health ser
vices and related medical care;
   An entity that p
rovides abortions
Šexcept in instances in which
 the pregnancy is the 
result of an act of rape or incest or 
the
 woman™s life is in danger; and
   An entity that
 had expenditures under the Medicaid program that exceeded 
$350
 million
 in fiscal year 2014
.  CBO expects that, 
according to those
 criteria, only Planned Parenthood Federation of 
America and its affiliates and clinics would be affected. Most federal funds received by 
such 
entities
 come from payments for services provided to enrollees in states™ Medicaid 
programs. CBO estimates 
that t
he prohibition
 would reduce direct spending by 
$178
 million in 2017 and by $234 million over the 2017
-2026 period. Those savings would 
be partially offset by increased spending for other Medicaid services
, as discussed bel
ow.
  To the extent that there woul
d be reductions in access to care under the legislation, they 
would affect services that help women avert pregnancies. The people most likely to 
experience reduced access to care would probably
 reside
 in areas without other health care 
clinics or medical p
ractitioners who serve low
-income populations. CBO projects that
 about
 15 percent of those pe
ople would lose access to care.
  
The government would incur some costs for Medicaid beneficiaries currently served by 
affected 
entities
 because the costs of about 
45 percent of all births are paid for by the 
Medicaid program. CBO estimates that 
the 
additional births 
stemming from
 the
 reduced 
access under the
 legislation would add to federal spending for Medicaid. In addition, some 
of those children would themselves 
qualify for Medicaid and possibly for other federal 
programs. 
By CBO™s estimates, i
n the one
-year period in which federal funds for 
Planned 
Parenthood 
would be prohibited under the legislation, the number of births in the Medicaid 
program would increase by
 several thousand, increasing direct spending for Medicaid by 
$21 million in 2017 and by $77 million over the 2017
-2026 period. 
Overall, with those 
costs netted against 
the savings estimated above, implementing the provision woul
d reduce 
direct spending by
 $156
 million over the 2017
-202
6 period
, CBO estimates.
  Repeal of Medicaid Provisions.
 Under current law, states can elect the Community First 
Choice option, allowing them to receive a 6 percentage
-point increase in their federal 
 24 matching rate for some se
rvices provided by home and community
-based attendants to 
certain Medicaid recipients. The legislation would terminate the increase in the federal 
matching funds beginning in calendar year 2020, which would decrease direct spending by 
about $12 
billion ove
r the next 10 years.
  
Repeal of 
Reductions to Allotments for 
Disproportionate Share Hospitals.
 Under 
current law, Medicaid allotments to states for payments to hospitals that treat a 
disproportionate share of uninsured and Medicaid patients are to be cut significantly in 
each year from 2018 to 2025. The cuts are currently scheduled to be $2 billion 
in 2018 and 
to 
increase each year until they reach $8 billion in 2024 and 2025. 
The legislation
 would 
eliminate those cuts
 for states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA starting in 
2018 and for the remaining states starting in 2020
, boosting out
lays 
by $31 billion over the 
next 10 years.
  
Safety Net Funding for States That Did Not Expand Medicaid.
 The legislation would 
provide $2 billion in funding in each year from 2018 to 2021 to states that did not expand 
Medicaid eligibility under the ACA. Th
ose states could use the funding, within limits, to 
supplement payments to providers that treat Medicaid enrollees. Such payments to 
providers would not be subject to the per capita caps also established by the proposed 
legislation. Any states that chose t
o expand Medicaid coverage as of July 1 of each year 
from 2017 through 2020 would lose access to the funding available under this provision in 

the following year and thereafter. CBO estimates that this provision would increase direct 
spending by $8 bil
lion
 over the 2017
-2026 period.
  
Reductions to States™ Medicaid Costs. 
The legislation would make a number of 
additional 
changes to the Medicaid program, including
 these
:   Requiring states to treat lottery winnings and certain 
other 
income as income for 
purpos
es of
 determining 
eligibility
;   Decreasing the period when Medicaid benefits may be co
vered retroactively from 
up to three
 months 
before
 a recipient™s application to the 
first of the 
month in which 
a recipient makes an application;
   Eliminating federal 
payments to states for Medicaid services provided to applicants 
who did not provide satisfactory evidence of citizenship or nationality during a 
reasonable opportunity period; and
   Eliminating state
s™ option to increase the amount of allowable home equity 
from 
$500,000 to $750,000 for individuals applying for Medicaid coverage of long
-term 
services and support
s.   25 Together, CBO estimates
, those changes would decrease direct spending by about 
$7 billion over the 2017
-2026 period.
  Changes in Spending Subject to Appropriation 
  CBO has not completed an estimate of the potential impact of the legislation on 
discretionary spending, which would be subject to future appropriation action.
   UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE ESTIMATES
  CBO and J
CT considered the potential responses of many parties that would be affected
 by the legislation, including these:
   Federal agencies
Šwhich would need to implement major changes in the regulation 
of the health care system and administration of new subsidy st
ructures and 
eligibility verification systems in a short time frame;
   States
Šwhich would need to decide how to use Patient and State Stability Fund 
grants, whether to pass new laws affecting the nongroup market, how to respond to 
the reduction in the feder
al matching rate for certain Medicaid enrollees, how to 
respond to constraints from the cap on Medicaid payments
, and how to provide 
information to the federal government about insurers and enrollees;
   Insurers
Šwho would need to decide about the extent of 
their participation in the 
insurance market
 and what types of plans to sell in the face of different market rules 
and federal subsidies
;   Employers
Šwho would need to decide whether to offer insurance 
given
 the
 different federal subsidies 
and insurance prod
ucts 
available to
 their employees
;   Individuals
Šwho would make decisions about health insurance 
in the 
context
 of 
different premiums
, subsidies
, and penalties
 than those under current law;
 and
   Doctors and hospitals
Šwho
 would need to negotiate contracts with insurers in a 
new regulatory environment.
  Each of those responses is difficult to predict. Moreover, the responses would depend upon 
how the provisions in the legislation were implemented, such as whether advance 
payments of the new tax credits were made reliably. And flaws in the determination of 
eligibility, for instance, could 
keep
 subsidies 
from 
people who 
were eligible or 
provide 
them to 
people
 who were not
.  26 In addition, CBO and JCT™s projections under current l
aw itself are inexact, which could 
also affect the estimated effects. For example, enrollment in the marketplaces 
under 
current law 
could be 
lower
 than is projected, which would tend to 
decrease
 the budgetary 
savings of the legislation. Alternatively, the 
average subsidy per enrollee 
under current law 
could be higher than is projected, which would tend to 
increase
 the budgetary savings of 
the legislation.
  CBO and JCT have endeavored to develop estimates that are in the middle of the 
distribution of potenti
al outcomes.
 One way to assess th
e rang
e 
of 
uncertainty 
around
 the 
estimated effects of the legislation is to compare previous projections with actual results. 
For example, some aspects of CBO and JCT™s projections of health insurance coverage and 
related spending made in July 2012 (after the Supreme Court issued a d
ecision that 
essentially
 made the expansion of the Medicaid program under the ACA a
n option
 for 
states)
 can be compared 
with
 actual results for 2016. Projected spending on people made 
eligible for Medicaid because of the ACA was about 60 percent of the act
ual amount. The 
number of people predicted in 2012 to purchase insurance through the marketplaces in 
2016 was m
ore than twice the actual number
. The decline in the number of insured people 
from 2012 to 2016 was projected to be 23 million, and the decline m
easured in the National 
Health Interview Survey turned out to be 20
 million. CBO and JCT have
 continued to
 learn 
from experience with the ACA
 and 
have 
endeavor
ed
 to use that experience to improve 
their modeling
.  That comparison 
of projections with
 actual 
results 
and the great uncertainties surrounding 
the actions of the many parties that would be affected by the legislation 
suggest that 
outcomes of the legislation could differ substantially from 
some of the estimate
s provided 
here. Nevertheless
, CBO and JC
T are confident about the direction of certain effects of the 
legislation. For example, spending on Medicaid would almost surely be lower than under 
current law. The cost of the new tax credit
 would probably be lower than the cost of the 
subsidies for cove
rage through marketplaces under current law. 
And t
he number of 
uninsured people under the legislation would almost surely be greater than under current 
law.
   INCREASE IN LONG
-TERM 
DIRECT SPENDING
 AND DEFICITS
  CBO estimates that enacting the legislation 
would
 not
 increase
 net direct spending or 
on-budget deficits
 by more than 
$5 billion in 
any of the four consecutive 10
-year periods
 beginning in 2027
.    27 MANDATES
 ON STATE, LOCAL, AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS
  JCT and 
CBO
 reviewed the provisions of the 
legislatio
n and determined that they would 
impose no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unf
unded Mandates Reform Act
. 
For large entitlement programs like Medicaid, UMRA defines an increase in the stringency 
of conditions or a cap on federal funding as an i
ntergovernmental mandate if the affected 
governments lack authority to offset those costs while continuing to provide required 
services. As discussed earlier in this estimate, the 
legislation
 would eliminate the enhanced 
federal matching rate for some futu
re enrollees, establish new per
 capita caps in the 
Medicaid program, and make other changes that would affect Medicaid spending
Šsome 
of which would provide a
dditional assistance to states.
  
On net, CBO estimates that states would see an overall decrease in
 federal assistance, as 
reflected in estimates of 
federal 
savings in the Medicaid program. In response to the caps 
and other changes, CBO 
anticipates that
 states could use existing flexibility
 allowed in the 
Medicaid program
 and additional authorities provided by the 
legislation
 to cut payments to 
health care providers and health plans, eliminate optional services, restrict eligibility for 

enrollment, or (to the extent feasible) change the way services are delivered to save c
osts. 
Because flexibility in the program would allow states to make such changes and still 

provide
 statutorily 
required services, the per
 capita caps and other changes in Medicaid 
would not impose intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA.
   MANDATES
 ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR
  JCT and CBO have determined that the 
legislation
 would impose private
-sector mandates 
as defined in UMRA. 
On the basis of 
information from JCT, CBO estimates that the 
aggregate 
direct 
cost of the mandates 
imposed by the legislation 
would exceed the annual 
threshold established in UMRA for private
-sector mandates ($156 million in 2017, 
adjusted annually for inflation).
  The tax provisions of the 
legislation
 contain two mandates. Specifically, the 
legislation
 would recapture excess advan
ce payments of premium tax credits (so that the full amount 
of excess advance payments is treated as an additional tax liability for the individual) and 
repeal the small business
 (health insurance) tax credit.
  
The nontax provisions of the 
legislation
 woul
d impose a private
-sector mandate as defined 
in UMRA on insurers that offer health insurance coverage in the individual or small
-group 
market. The 
legislation
 would require those insurers to charge a penalty equal to 30 percent 
of the monthly premium for a
 period of 12 months to individuals who enroll in insurance in 
a given year after having allowed their health insurance to lapse for more than 63 days 

during the previous year. CBO estimates that the costs of complying with the mandate 
would be largely off
set by the penalties insurers would collect.

Premium

Premium Tax Credit

Net Premium Paid
Under current law, premium tax credits are calculated as the difference between the reference premium and a specified percentage of 
income for a person with income at a given percentage of the FPL. The reference premium is the premium for the second-lowest-cost 
silver plan available in the marketplace in the area in which the person resides. A silver plan covers about 70 percent of the costs of 


may apply. Under the AHCA, the premium tax credits offered for nongroup coverage would be indexed to the consumer price index for all 
urban consumers plus 1 percentage point. In 2026, CBO projects, those tax credits would be about 22 percent higher than the amounts 
specified in 2020.
The actuarial value of a plan is the percentage of costs for covered services that the plan pays. Cost-sharing subsidies are payments made 
by the federal government to insurers that reduce the cost-sharing amounts (out-of-pocket payments required under insurance policies) for 
covered people whose income is generally between 100 percent and 250 percent of the FPL. The cost-sharing subsidy amounts in this 
example would range from $1,100 for a 21-year-old with income at 175 percent of the FPL to $3,350 for a 64-year-old at the same income 
level. Under current law, cost-sharing subsidies have the effect of increasing the actuarial value of the plan from 70 percent for a typical 
silver plan to 94 percent for people whose income is between 100 percent and 149 percent of the FPL; 87 percent for people between 150 
percent and 199 percent of the FPL; and 73 percent for people between 200 percent and 249 percent of the FPL. People whose income is 
250 percent of the FPL or more would receive a standard 70 percent actuarial value when purchasing a silver plan. CBO projects that, 
under the AHCA, the elimination of required actuarial values and the structure of new tax credits would, by 2026, result in a reduction to 
about 65 percent in the average actuarial value of plans purchased in the nongroup market.
Income levels reflect modified adjusted gross income, which equals adjusted gross income plus untaxed Social Security benefits, foreign 
earned income that is excluded from adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest, and income of dependent filers. CBO projects that in 
2026, a modified adjusted gross income of $26,500 would equal 175 percent of the FPL and an income of $68,200 would equal 450 
percent of the FPL.
For this illustration, CBO projected the average national premiums for a 21-year-old in the nongroup health insurance market in 2026 both 
under current law and under the AHCA. On the basis of those amounts, CBO calculated premiums for a 40-year-old and a 64-year-old, 
assuming that the person lives in a state that uses the federal default age-rating methodology, which limits variation of premiums to a ratio 
of 3 to 1 for adults under current law and 5 to 1 for adults under the AHCA. CBO projects that, under current law, most states will use the 
default 3-to-1 age-rating curve; under the AHCA, CBO projects, most would use an age-rating curve with a maximum ratio of 5 to 1.

Includes coverage under the Basic Health Program, which allows states to establish a coverage program primarily for people whose

Estimates are based on CBO™s March 2016 baseline, adjusted for subsequent legislation. They re˚ect average enrollment over the course 
of a year. Under CBO™s current-law projections, additional states would expand Medicaid eligibility to people who are made newly eligible 

under the A˛ordable Care Act (adults under the age of 65 whose income is below 138 percent of the federal poverty level). Enrollment 

estimates associated with those future expansions are separated in the ˝gure to highlight the change in Medicaid enrollment under the
