 Until recently, it has enjoyed broad, bipartisan political support.
 On Saturday, I expect the House to approve the Delivering for America Act, of which I am a sponsor.

 Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who chairs the House Ways and Means health subcommittee, said on Tuesday that the government’s “distribution of remdesivir seems akin to winning the lottery — a random stroke of luck rather than a medically-informed decision.” Read More                   View this post on Instagram   With taxpayers footing the bill for #coronavirus treatment and vaccine research, we must continue to ask questions, demand facts, and ensure accountability from an Administration accustomed to enriching the few at the expense of the many.

 – As Central Texas COVID-19 infections rise and the uninsured crisis deepens with continued unemployment, community leaders join together to promote Open Enrollment, when families can sign up to get Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage.
 Despite attempts to eliminate the ACA and strip away protections for people with pre-existing conditions, it remains the law of the land—and so the health care marketplace is still available for those seeking insurance coverage for 2021.
 Open Enrollment lasts through December 15.
