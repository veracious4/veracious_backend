 The NHTSA developed fuel consumption standards under the authority of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA), while the EPA developed a GHG emissions program under the Clean Air Act.
 The GHG program includes CO2 emission standards, as well as emission standards for N2O and CH4, and provisions to control hydrofluorocarbon leaks from air conditioning systems.
 The standards are applicable to all on-road vehicles rated at a GVW≥8,500 lbs, and the engines that power them, except those covered by the GHG emissions and Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for MY 2012-2016 and MY 2017-2025 light-duty vehicles.
 The GHG/FE standards were adopted in two phases:   Phase 1 regulation—adopted on August 9, 2011 [2324]—covers model years (MY) 2014-2018, with NHTSA fuel economy standards being voluntary in MY 2014-2015 to satisfy EISA lead time requirements.
 Phase 2 regulation—published on August 16, 2016 [2918]—applies to MY 2021-2027 vehicles.
 The Phase 2 rule also introduces new standards for trailers, a category not previously regulated.
 The EPA trailer standards begin in MY 2018 (for certain trailers), while NHTSA’s standards take effect in MY 2021, with credits available for voluntary participation before then.
 The Phase 1/2 standards are applicable federally, as well as in California.
 However, the California Air Resources Board (ARB) deemed the federal Phase 2 program not sufficiently strong to meet California GHG emission reduction goals.
 The ARB started the development of California Phase 2 GHG emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles that would provide GHG emission reductions beyond those of the federal Phase 2 program.
 The California Phase 2 standards are expected to be proposed by the end of 2017.
 Under the Phase 1 and Phase 2 regulations, different CO2 and fuel consumption standards are applicable to different categories of vehicles, including combination tractors, trailers, vocational vehicles, and heavy-duty pickups and vans:   Combination tractors (the semi-trucks that typically pull trailers): Phase 1 engine and vehicle standards begin in MY 2014 and achieve 7-20% reduction in CO2 emissions and fuel consumption by MY 2017 over the 2010 baselines.
 Phase 2 standards begin in MY 2021 and achieve 15-27% reduction in CO2 emissions by MY 2027 over the 2017 baselines.
 Trailers: The standards start in MY 2018 and achieve 6-10% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by MY 2027 over the 2017 baselines.
 Vocational vehicles: Phase 1 engine and vehicle standards start in MY 2014 and achieve up to a 10% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by MY 2017 over the 2010 baselines.
 Phase 2 standards start in MY 2021 and require a 10-18% reduction in CO2 emissions from gasoline vehicles and a 12-24% CO2 emission reduction from diesel vehicles by MY 2027 over the 2017 baselines.
 Heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans: Phase 1 standards phase-in starting in MY 2014 and achieve up to a 10% reduction in CO2 emissions and fuel consumption for gasoline vehicles and 15% reduction for diesel vehicles by MY 2018.
 Phase 2 standards require a 16% CO2 emissions reduction from MY 2021 to MY 2027.
 The majority of vehicles covered by the regulations carry payloads of goods or equipment, in addition to passengers.
 To account for this, the standards have been expressed using two types of metrics:   Gram CO2 per ton-mile (and gallon of fuel per 1,000 ton-mile) standards for vocational vehicles and combination tractors; and  Payload-dependent gram CO2 per mile (and gallon of fuel per 100-mile) standards for pickups and vans.
 Testing &amp; Compliance Determination.
 The requirements for tractors and vocational vehicles include both engine and vehicle standards.
 Engine manufacturers are subject to the engine standards.
 Testing is conducted over one test cycle:  Tractor engines are tested over the steady-state SET test, Vocational engines are tested over the FTP transient test.
 The Phase 2 regulation introduced a new set of SET weighting factors, applicable only to GHG measurements (not applicable to pollutant emission measurements).
 The new weighting factors address the trend towards engine downspeeding.
 Chassis manufacturers are subject to the vehicle standards.
 The regulations do not require chassis testing—vehicle standards compliance is typically determined based on a vehicle simulation model, called the Greenhouse gas Emission Model (GEM), developed by the EPA specifically for the GHG/FE regulations.
 The Phase 2 regulation introduced a number of changes to the GEM model.
 These characteristics relate to key technologies applicable to a given truck category—including aerodynamic features, weight reductions, tire rolling resistance, the presence of idle-reducing technology, vehicle speed limiters, and other factors.
 CO2 and Fuel Consumption Standards Combination Tractors  Differentiated standards were adopted for several subcategories of combination tractors based on three attributes: weight class, cab type and roof height.
 The standards phase in to the 2017 (Phase 1) and 2027 (Phase 2) levels shown in Table 1.

 In addition to vehicle standards, engine-based standards must be met by heavy-heavy-duty (HHD) and medium-heavy-duty (MHD) diesel engines used in tractors, Table 2.

 CO2 emissions are tested on the same engine that is tested for pollutant emissions—typically the highest rated engine within an engine family.
 While this is the “worst case” rating for meeting pollutant emission standards, it is typically the rating with the lowest specific CO2 emissions within the engine family.
 Trailers  The Phase 2 program introduced a new set of standards to promote the efficiency of commercial trailers.
 The first trailer standards become effective in MY 2018.
 The final 2027 standards are shown in Table 3.
 Table 3: Final (MY 2027) standards for full-aero box vans   CategoryEPA CO2 EmissionsNHTSA Fuel Consumption g/ton-milegal/1,000 ton-mile   Dry Van Long75.77.43615  Short119.411.7288 Refrigerated VanLong77.47.60314  Short123.212.10216    The Phase 2 rule also includes CO2/FE standards for partial-aero box vans, as well as design-based standards (tire rolling resistance level and pressure system) for non-box trailers and non-aero box vans.
 Both sets of standards are phased in over 2018-2021.
 Vocational Trucks  At Phase 1, this vehicle segment has been divided into three regulatory subcategories—Light Heavy (Class 2b through 5), Medium Heavy (Class 6 and 7), and Heavy Heavy (Class 8)—which is consistent with engine classifications.
 At Phase 2, the standards were further differentiated depending on engine type (diesel, gasoline) and the duty cycle: urban, multi-purpose and regional.
 The final Phase 1 (2017) and Phase 2 (2027) vehicle standards are depicted in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively.

 Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans  The commercial pickup and van category includes those vehicles of GVWR from 8,501 to 14,000 lbs that are not regulated under the light-duty GHG/CAFE vehicle regulations.
 These vehicles must meet corporate average CO2 and fuel economy standards, in an approach similar to that taken for light-duty vehicles, but with different standards for gasoline and diesel vehicles.
 The EPA has established CO2 standards in the form of a set of target standard curves, based on a “work factor” that combines a vehicle’s payload, towing capabilities, and whether or not it has 4-wheel drive.
 The standards phase in with increasing stringency in each model year.
 The EPA standards include a separate standard to control air conditioning system leakage.
 NHTSA has set corporate average standards for fuel consumption that are equivalent to EPA‘s standards (though not including the EPA’s air conditioning leakage standard).
 At Phase 1, manufacturers were provided with two alternative phase-in approaches.
 One alternative phased in the final standards at 15-20-40-60-100 percent in model years 2014-2015-2016-2017-2018.
 The other phased in the final standards at 15-20-67-67-67-100 percent in model years 2014-2015-2016-2017-2018-2019.
 Phase 2 standards are phased in over model years 2021-2027.
 The standards were designed to cap emissions at the levels circa 2010 to prevent N2O/CH4 emission increases in future engines.
 Other Provisions  Flexibilities.
 The regulations include certain flexibilities for vehicle manufacturers.
 The Phase 1 rule included optional compliance schedules, with more relaxed standards to be met from 2013, and with identical final standards.
 At Phase 2, optional sets of CO2 and fuel economy standards are available for some vehicle categories, which use different GEM model inputs.
 A/C Leakage.
 EPA has adopted standards to assure that low-leakage components are used in air conditioning systems designed for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, and semi trucks.
 The standard for larger A/C systems (capacity above 733 g) is measured in percent total refrigerant leakage per year, while the standard for smaller A/C systems (capacity of 733 g or less) is measured in grams of refrigerant leakage per year.
 Useful Life.
 The EPA CO2 emissions must be met over the engine’s and vehicle’s useful life.
 The useful life definitions for engines and for vehicles that use the respective engine categories are identical to those defined for criteria pollutant standards for MY 2004 and later heavy-duty engines and Tier 2 &amp; Tier 3 standards for light-duty vehicles:  LHDDE—Phase 1: 110,000 miles/10 years; Phase 2: 150,000 miles/15 years MHDDE—185,000 miles/10 years HHDDE—435,000 miles/10 years       United States  Light-Duty: T3 | T2 | T1 Light-Duty: California Heavy-Duty Engines Nonroad Diesel Engines Locomotives Marine Engines  Stationary Engines  SI NSPS | CI NSPS | NESHAP  OBD  California | Federal  Fuel Economy/GHG  Cars GHG+CAFE | CAFE Cars GHG: California Trucks GHG  In-Use Engines  California Diesel Program UBRR Program (1995) Occupational Health    bannerAd()   Home » Emission Standards » USA » Trucks GHG  Revision: 2017.01Copyright © 1997 - 2020 ECOpoint Inc.DieselNet FAQ | Contact Us
