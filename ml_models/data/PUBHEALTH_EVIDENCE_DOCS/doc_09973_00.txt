 View Data Table     Rate of New Cases and Deaths per 100,000: The rate of new cases of colorectal cancer was 38.2 per 100,000 men and women per year.
 The death rate was 13.7 per 100,000 men and women per year.
 These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2013–2017 cases and 2014–2018 deaths.
 Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer: Approximately 4.2 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer at some point during their lifetime, based on 2015–2017 data.
 Prevalence of This Cancer: In 2017, there were an estimated 1,348,087 people living with colorectal cancer in the United States.
 Did you know?
 Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer diagnosed in the United States.
 Did You Know?
 Relative survival is an estimate of the percentage of patients who would be expected to survive the effects of their cancer.
 It excludes the risk of dying from other causes.
 Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient.
 5-YearRelative Survival 64.6%     Based on data from SEER 18 2010–2016.
 Gray figures represent those who have died from colorectal cancer.
 Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.
 Additional Information 			  More about survival statistics Additional colorectal cancer survival statistics in SEER*Explorer   Survival by Stage Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival.
 In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is localized (sometimes referred to as stage 1).
 If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is regional or distant.
 The earlier colorectal cancer is caught, the better chance a person has of surviving five years after being diagnosed.
 For colorectal cancer, 38.2% are diagnosed at the local stage.
 The 5-year relative survival for localized colorectal cancer is 90.2%.

 Figure: Anatomy of the Lower Digestive System     Figure: Gastrointestinal (digestive) system anatomy; shows esophagus, liver, stomach, colon, small intestine, rectum, and anus.
 Cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer.
 Cancer that starts in either of these organs may also be called colorectal cancer.
 The digestive system is made up of the esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines.
 The first 6 feet of the large intestine are called the large bowel or colon.
 The last 6 inches are the rectum and the anal canal.
