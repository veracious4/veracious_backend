 Across the country, lines to get into stores snaked around corners, checkout times stretched as long as an hour and whole aisles were rendered bare this week as companies told more workers to stay home and schools began to cancel classes.
 President Trump on Sunday held a conference call with more than two dozen grocery and supply chain executives, including those from Walmart Inc., Target Corp. , Costco Wholesale Corp. , Sysco Corp. and Tyson Foods Inc.   Kroger Co. Chief Executive Rodney McMullen wrote in a memo to employees on Sunday that a worker in Colorado and another in Washington tested positive for Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus.
 He said the stores will remain open and that the nation’s biggest supermarket chain would give paid time off to workers diagnosed with Covid-19 and those placed under mandatory quarantine.
 “Our stores, facilities, plants and offices are busier than ever before,” Mr. McMullen wrote.
