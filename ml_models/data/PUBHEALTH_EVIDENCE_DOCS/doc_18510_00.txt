 Abstract Problem/Condition: Since 1969, CDC has conducted abortion surveillance to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions in the United States.
 Reporting Period Covered: 2009.
 Description of System: Each year, CDC requests abortion data from the central health agencies of 52 reporting areas (the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City).
 The reporting areas provide this information voluntarily.
 For 2009, data were received from 48 reporting areas.
 For the purpose of trend analysis, abortion data were evaluated from the 45 areas that reported data every year during 2000–2009.
 Census and natality data, respectively, were used to calculated abortion rates (number of abortions per 1,000 women) and ratios (number of abortions per 1,000 live births).
 Results: A total of 784,507 abortions were reported to CDC for 2009.
 Of these abortions, 772,630 (98.5%) were from the 45 reporting areas that provided data every year during 2000–2009.
 Among these same 45 reporting areas, the abortion rate for 2009 was 15.1 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years, and the abortion ratio was 227 abortions per 1,000 live births.
 Compared with 2008, the total number and rate of reported abortions for 2009 decreased 5%, representing the largest single year decrease for the entire period of analysis.
 The abortion ratio decreased 2%.
 From 2000 to 2009, the total number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions decreased 6%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, to the lowest levels for 2000–2009.
 In 2009 and throughout the period of analysis, women in their 20s accounted for the majority of abortions and had the highest abortion rates, whereas women aged ≥30 years accounted for a much smaller percentage of abortions and had lower abortion rates.
 In 2009, women aged 20–24 and 25–29 years accounted for 32.7% and 24.4% of all abortions, respectively, and had an abortion rate of 27.4 abortions per 1,000 women aged 20–24 years and 20.4 abortions per 1,000 women aged 25–29 years.
 In contrast, women aged 30–34, 35–39, and ≥40 years accounted for 14.7%, 8.8%, and 3.3% of all abortions, respectively, and had an abortion rate of 13.3 abortions per 1,000 women aged 30–34 years, 7.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 35–39 years, and 2.7 abortions per 1,000 women aged ≥40 years.
 Throughout the period of analysis, abortion rates decreased among women aged 20–24 and 25–29 years, whereas they increased among women aged ≥40 years.
 In 2009, adolescents aged 15–19 years accounted for 15.5% of all abortions and had an abortion rate of 13.0 abortions per 1,000 adolescents aged 15–19 years.
 Throughout the period of analysis, the percentage of all abortions accounted for by adolescents and the adolescent abortion rate decreased.
 In contrast to the percentage distribution of abortions and abortion rates by age, abortion ratios in 2009 and throughout the entire period of analysis were highest among adolescents and lowest among women aged 30–39 years.
 Abortion ratios decreased from 2000 to 2009 for women in all age groups except for those aged 13 weeks' decreased 12%.
 Moreover, among abortions performed at ≤13 weeks' gestation, the distribution shifted toward earlier gestational ages, with the percentage of these abortions performed at ≤6 weeks' gestation increasing 47%.
 In 2009, 74.2% of abortions were performed by curettage at ≤13 weeks' gestation, 16.5% were performed by early medical abortion (a nonsurgical abortion at ≤8 weeks' gestation), and 8.1% were performed by curettage at &gt;13 weeks' gestation.
 Among abortions that were performed at ≤8 weeks' gestation and thus were eligible for early medical abortion, 25.2% were completed by this method.
 The use of early medical abortion increased 10% from 2008 to 2009.
 Deaths of women associated with complications from abortions for 2009 are being investigated under CDC's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System.
 In 2008, the most recent year for which data were available, 12 women were reported to have died as a result of complications from known legal induced abortions.
 No reported deaths were associated with known illegal induced abortions.
 However, the change from 2008 to 2009 for both the total number of abortions and the abortion rate was the largest single year decrease during 2000–2009, and all three measures of abortion (total numbers, rates, and ratios) decreased to the lowest level observed during this period.
 Public Health Actions: Unintended pregnancy is the major contributor to abortion.
 Because unintended pregnancies are rare among women who use the most effective methods of reversible contraception, increasing access to and use of these methods can help further reduce the number of abortions performed in the United States.
 The data in this report can help program planners and policy makers identify groups of women at greatest risk for unintended pregnancy and help guide and evaluate prevention efforts.
 Introduction This report is based on abortion data for 2000–2009 that were provided voluntarily to CDC by the central health agencies of 48 reporting areas (the District of Columbia; New York City; and 46 states, excluding California, Delaware, Maryland, and New Hampshire).
 Since 1969, CDC has conducted abortion surveillance to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions in the United States (1).
 Following nationwide legalization of abortion in 1973, the total number, rate (number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years), and ratio (number of abortions per 1,000 live births) of reported abortions increased rapidly, reaching the highest levels in the 1980s before decreasing at a slow yet steady pace (2–6).
 Continued surveillance is needed to monitor long-term changes in the incidence of abortion in the United States.
 Methods Description of the Surveillance System Each year, CDC requests tabulated data from the central health agencies of 52 reporting areas (the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City) to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining abortions in the United States.
 For the purpose of surveillance, a legal induced abortion* is defined as an intervention performed by a licensed clinician (e.g., a physician, nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) that is intended to terminate a suspected or known ongoing intrauterine pregnancy and produce a nonviable fetus at any gestational age.
 In most states, collection of abortion data is facilitated by the legal requirement for hospitals, facilities, and physicians to report abortions to a central health agency (16).
 These central health agencies voluntarily provide CDC aggregate numbers for the abortion data they have collected (17).
 Although reporting to CDC is voluntary, most reporting areas do provide aggregate abortion numbers: during 2000–2009, a total of 45 reporting areas provided CDC a continuous annual record of abortion numbers,† and in 2009, CDC obtained aggregate abortion numbers from 48 reporting areas (excludes California, Delaware, Maryland, and New Hampshire).
 To encourage more uniform collection of these details, CDC has developed a model reporting form to serve as a technical guide (18).
 However, because the collection of abortion data is not federally mandated, many reporting areas have developed their own forms and do not collect all the information that CDC compiles.
 Variables and Categorization of Data Each year, CDC sends suggested templates to the central health agencies for compilation of abortion data in aggregate.
 For curettage, abortions are categorized as having been performed at ≤13 weeks' gestation or at &gt;13 weeks' gestation because of differences in technique used before and after 13 weeks (20).
 Finally, because intrauterine instillations cannot be performed early in gestation, abortions reported to have been performed by intrauterine installation at ≤12 weeks' gestation are excluded from calculation of the percentage of abortions by known method type.††  Measures of Abortion Four measures of abortion are presented in this report: 1) the total number of abortions in a given population, 2) the percentage of abortions obtained by a given subpopulation, 3) the abortion rate (number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years or other specific group within a given population), and 4) the abortion ratio (number of abortions per 1,000 live births within a given population).
 Although total numbers and percentages are useful measures for determining how many women have obtained an abortion, abortion rates adjust for differences in subpopulation size and reflect how likely abortion is among women in particular groups.
 Abortion ratios measure the relative number of pregnancies in a population that end in abortion compared with live birth.
 Abortion ratios are influenced both by the proportion of pregnancies in a population that are unintended and the proportion of unintended pregnancies that end in abortion.
 Abortion ratios also are influenced by the proportion of intended pregnancies that end in abortion; however, intended pregnancies account for a very small percentage of abortions ( 15 years were lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000, with the greatest decreases occurring among adolescents aged 18–19 years (Table 6).
 For all adolescents aged 15–19 years this decrease occurred almost exclusively from 2005 to 2009 and not from 2000 to 2004.
 Gestational Age Among the 39 areas that reported gestational age at the time of abortion for 2009 (Table 7), the majority (64.0%) of abortions were performed at ≤8 weeks' gestation, and 91.7% were performed at ≤13 weeks' gestation.
 Few abortions (7.0%) were performed at 14–20 weeks' gestation, and even fewer (1.3%) were performed at ≥21 weeks' gestation.
 Among the 30 reporting areas that provided data on gestational age every year during 2000–2009 (Table 8), the percentage of abortions performed at ≤13 weeks' gestation increased only slightly.
 However, within this gestational age range, a shift occurred toward earlier gestational ages, with abortions performed at ≤8 weeks' gestation increasing 12%.
 The percentage increase in abortions performed at ≤8 weeks' was greatest from 2000 to 2004 but continued from 2005 to 2009.
 Throughout the period of analysis, the percentage of abortions performed at &gt;13 weeks' gestation remained low ( 13 weeks' gestation, and all other methods were uncommon (Table 11).
 Among the 27 reporting areas that included medical abortion on their reporting form and provided this data for all 3 years of comparison (2001, the first full year following FDA approval of mifepristone for use in early medical abortion, as well as 2008 and 2009),¶¶¶ the use of early medical abortion increased 10% from 2008 to 2009 and approximately 350% from 2001 to 2009 (from 3.4% of abortions in 2001 to 13.8% in 2008 and 15.2% in 2009).
 In contrast, use of curettage at ≤13 weeks' gestation decreased 2% from 2008 to 2009 and 14% from 2001 to 2009 (from 87.3% of abortions in 2001 to 76.7% in 2008 and 75.5% in 2009).
 Use of curettage at &gt;13 weeks' gestation was stable from 2001 to 2008 but decreased 5% from 2008 to 2009 (from 8.6% of abortions in 2001 and in 2008 to 8.2% in 2009).
 All other methods consistently accounted for a small percentage of abortions (0.04%–0.9%).
 Race/Ethnicity Among the 29 areas that reported cross-classified race/ethnicity data for 2009 (Table 12), non-Hispanic white women and non-Hispanic black women accounted for the largest percentages of abortions (37.7% and 35.4%, respectively), whereas Hispanic women and non-Hispanic women in the other races category accounted for smaller percentages (20.6% and 6.3%, respectively).
 Non-Hispanic white women had the lowest abortion rates (8.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years) and ratios (140 abortions per 1,000 live births), whereas non-Hispanic black women had the highest abortion rates (32.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years) and ratios (477 abortions per 1,000 live births).
 Among the 24 areas**** that reported by race/ethnicity every year during 2007–2009, abortion rates decreased for all racial/ethnic groups.
 The abortion rate decreased 7% for non-Hispanic white women (from 9.1 abortions per 1,000 women in 2007 to 8.5 in 2009) and 6% for Hispanic women (from 20.5 abortions per 1,000 women in 2007 to 19.3 in 2009) but only 1% for non-Hispanic black women (from 34.6 abortions per 1,000 women in 2007 to 34.2 in 2009).
 In contrast, abortion ratios decreased among non-Hispanic white women but not among women in any other racial/ethnic group.
 For non-Hispanic white women, the abortion ratio decreased 3% (from 143 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 138 in 2009), whereas the abortion ratio increased 4% for non-Hispanic black women (from 481 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 501 in 2009) and 2% for Hispanic women (from 192 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 195 in 2009).
 Data also are reported separately by race and by ethnicity for 2009 (Tables 13 and 15) and for 2000–2009 (Tables 14 and 16).
 Marital Status Among the 37 areas that reported marital status for 2009, 15.0% of all women who obtained abortions were married, and 85.0% were unmarried (Table 17).
 For the 28 reporting areas†††† that provided these data for the relevant years of comparison, the percentage of abortions accounted for by unmarried women increased 4% from 2000 to 2009 (from 81.6% in 2000 to 85.0% in 2009); an increase occurred both from 2000 to 2004 and from 2005 to 2009.
 Previous Live Births and Abortions Data from the 36 areas that reported the number of previous live births for women who obtained abortions in 2009 show that 40.2%, 46.3%, and 13.6% of these women previously had zero, one to two, or three or more live births, respectively (Table 18).
 Among the 29 reporting areas§§§§ that provided these data for the relevant years of comparison, little change occurred in the distribution of abortions by the number of previous live births: the percentage of women who had zero previous live births was 39.7% in 2000 and 40.1% in 2009; the percentage of women who had one to two previous live births was 48.0% in 2000 and 46.4% in 2009; and the percentage of women who had three or more previous live births was 12.4% in 2000 and 13.5% in 2009.
 Data from the 37 areas that reported the number of previous abortions for women obtaining abortions in 2009 show that the majority of women (55.3%) had not previously had an abortion; 36.6% had previously had either one to two abortions, and 8.1% had three or more abortions (Table 19).
 Among the 30 reporting areas¶¶¶¶ that provided data for the relevant years of comparison, the distribution of abortions by the number of previous abortions changed little: the percentage of women who had zero previous abortions was 55.0% in 2000 and 55.4% in 2009; the percentage of women who had one or two previous abortions was 37.3% in 2000 and 36.5% in 2009; and the percentage of women who had three or more previous abortions was 7.7% in 2000 and 8.2% in 2009.
 Age and Marital Status by Race and Race/Ethnicity In some reporting areas, abortions that were categorized by maternal race and race/ethnicity were further categorized by maternal age and marital status (Tables 20 and 21).
 A consistent pattern existed for abortion by age across all racial and racial/ethnic groups, with the smallest percentage of abortions occurring among adolescents aged 13 weeks' gestation, a greater understanding is needed of the factors that cause delays in pregnancy termination (48–51).
 The trend of obtaining abortions earlier in pregnancy, although not observed equally among all subgroups of women, has been facilitated by changes in abortion practices.
 Curettage has remained the most common method for performing abortions.
 Although for many years this type of abortion was performed only after the initial weeks of gestation, the development of highly sensitive pregnancy tests and transvaginal ultrasonography increasingly have allowed clinicians to diagnose pregnancy and confirm its termination at ≤6 weeks' gestation (52–57).
 In addition, the use of medical abortion might have contributed to the increasing percentage of abortions performed early in gestation.
 In September 2000, FDA approved mifepristone for use in early medical abortion (34), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has endorsed an evidence-based protocol that can be used up to 63 days of gestation (19).
 In 2009, 64.0% of abortions were performed at ≤8 weeks' gestation and thus were eligible for early medical abortion; 25.2% of these eligible abortions and 16.5% of all abortions were reported as early medical abortions.
 Moreover, the use of early medical abortion has increased substantially since FDA approval of mifepristone: from 2001 to 2009, the percentage of all reported abortions accounted for by this method increased approximately 350%.
 Furthermore, whereas the rate of increase leveled off after the initial years of approval (58), the proportional use of this method has continued to increase, with the percentage of all abortions reported as early medical abortion increasing 10% from 2008 to 2009.
 In 2008, 12 legal induced abortion-related deaths occurred; no women died as a result of a known illegal abortion.
 The annual number of legal induced abortions has fluctuated from year to year over the past 36 years (Table 25).
 For example, 12 abortion-related deaths occurred in 1994, four deaths in 1995, and nine deaths in 1996.
 The national legal induced abortion case-fatality rate was 0.64 legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal induced abortions for both the most recent period (2004–2008) and the preceding 5-year period (1999–2003).
 Limitations The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations.
 During the period covered by this report, the total annual number of abortions recorded by CDC was 65%–69% of the number recorded by the Guttmacher Institute (12,59), which uses numerous active follow-up techniques to increase the completeness of the data obtained through its periodic national census of abortion providers (12).
 Although most reporting areas collect and send abortion data to CDC, this information is given to CDC voluntarily.
 Consequently, during 2000–2009, seven of the 52 reporting areas did not provide CDC data on a consistent annual basis, and for 2009, CDC did not obtain any information from California, Delaware, Maryland, or New Hampshire.
 ***** In addition, whereas most of the reporting areas that send abortion data to CDC have laws requiring medical providers to submit a report for every abortion they perform to a central health agency, in New Jersey and the District of Columbia, medical providers submit this information voluntarily (16).
 Consequently, several other reporting areas tend to provide CDC with incomplete numbers.§§§§§  Second, because reporting requirements are established by the individual reporting areas, many states have developed reporting forms that do not resemble the template CDC created for technical guidance (18).
 Consequently, many reporting areas do not collect all the information CDC compiles on the characteristics of women obtaining abortions (e.g., age, race, and ethnicity) (60).
 Although missing demographic information can reduce the extent to which the statistics in this report represent all women in the United States, four nationally representative surveys of women obtaining abortions in 1987, 1994–1995, 2001–2002, and 2008 (7–10) have produced distributions, for most characteristics, that are nearly identical to the distributions reported by CDC.
 The one exception is the distribution of abortions by race/ethnicity.
 In particular, the percentage of abortions accounted for by non-Hispanic black women is higher in this report than the percentage in reports based on a recent nationally representative survey of abortion patients (10).
 Similarly, the greater decrease in abortion rates for non-Hispanic black women compared with women of other racial/ethnic groups based on nationally representative survey data (11) is not supported by the data reported to CDC.
 Importantly, some of the reporting areas that have not reported to CDC, or have not reported cross-classified race/ethnicity data (e.g., California, Florida, and Illinois), have large enough populations of minority women that the absence of data from these areas reduces the representativeness of CDC data.
 Third, abortion data are compiled and reported to CDC by the central health agency of the reporting area in which the abortion was performed rather than the reporting area in which the woman lived.
 This inflates abortion statistics for reporting areas in which a high percentage of abortions are obtained by out-of-state residents and undercounts abortions for states with limited abortion services, more stringent legal requirements for obtaining an abortion, or geographic proximity to services in another state.
 To adjust for these biases, CDC attempts to categorize abortions by residence in addition to occurrence.
 However, in 2009, CDC was unable to identify the reporting area, territory, or country of residence for 11.4% of reported abortions.
 Public Health Implications Ongoing abortion surveillance is important for several reasons.
 First, abortion surveillance is needed to guide and evaluate programs aimed at preventing unintended pregnancies.
 Pregnancy intentions are complex and difficult to assess (61–68); abortion surveillance provides an important measure of pregnancies that are unwanted.
 Second, routine abortion surveillance is needed to assess changes in clinical practice patterns over time.
 Information in this report on the prevalence of abortions performed through different methods (e.g., medical or curettage) and at different gestational ages provides the denominator data that are necessary for analyses of the relative safety of abortion practices.
 According to the most recent national estimates, 18% of all pregnancies in the United States end in abortion (5).
 Multiple factors are known to influence the incidence of abortion, including the availability of abortion providers (12,70–72); state regulations, such as mandatory waiting periods (73), parental involvement laws (74), and legal restrictions on abortion providers (75); increasing acceptance of nonmarital childbearing (76,77); shifts in the racial/ethnic composition of the U.S. population (78,79); and changes in the economy and the resulting impact on fertility preferences and access to health-care services, including contraception (80,81).
 However, despite these multiple influences, given that unintended pregnancy precedes nearly all abortions (23),¶¶¶¶¶ efforts to reduce the incidence of abortion need to focus on helping women avoid pregnancies that they do not desire.
 Providing women and men with the knowledge and resources necessary to make decisions about their sexual behavior and use of contraception can help them avoid unintended pregnancies.
 However, efforts to improve contraceptive use and reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the United States have been challenging.
 Findings from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), the primary national source of data on unintended pregnancy in the United States, suggest that unintended pregnancy decreased during 1982–1995 in conjunction with an increase in contraceptive use among women at risk for unintended pregnancy (82–84).
 ****** However, data from the 2002 and 2006–2010 NSFGs show that contraceptive use among women at risk for unintended pregnancy has decreased (84,85).
 Moreover, although use of the most effective forms of reversible contraception (i.e., intrauterine devices and hormonal implants, which are as effective as sterilization at preventing unintended pregnancy [86]) has increased (85,87), use of these methods in the United States remains among the lowest of any developed country (87), and no additional progress has been made toward reducing unintended pregnancy (41,42).
 Research has shown that providing no-cost contraception increases use of the most effective methods and can reduce abortion rates (88,89).
 Removing cost as one barrier to the use of the most effective contraceptive methods might therefore be an important way to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and consequently the number of abortions that are performed in the United States.

 §§§ 	Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women's centers, information could not be obtained for all abortions performed in New Jersey.
 ¶¶¶ 	Because more than one method was reported for some abortions, the sum of the individual methods exceeds the total number of abortions reported by known method type.
 "Other" methods might have been used concomitantly with specified method types to aid in the completion of the abortion.
 **** 	Includes residents only.
 ††††	Small numbers removed from individual cells have been subtracted from the column total so that the missing number cannot be back-calculated from the total.
 §§§§	Curettage abortions reported without a gestational age were distributed among the curettage categories according to the distribution of abortions performed by curettage at known gestational age.
 ¶¶¶¶	Medical abortions reported without a gestational age were distributed among the medical abortion categories according to the distribution of medical abortions at known gestational age.
 *****	Because some states reported more than one method for some abortions, the sum of the individual methods exceeds the total number of abortions reported by known method type.
 †††††	Excludes five states (Alabama, Hawaii, Louisiana, Nevada, and Tennessee) that have been included in the total for all areas reporting by method type.
 These states were excluded because medical abortion was not included as a separate category on their reporting form.

 Because a substantial number of legal induced abortions occurred outside reporting areas that provided data to CDC, national case-fatality rates (i.e., number of legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal induced abortions in the United States) were calculated with denominator data from a more complete source (Source: Jones RK, Kooistra K. Abortion incidence and access to services in the United States, 2008.

 Case-fatality rates were computed for the 5-year period 1973–1978 and for consecutive 5-year periods thereafter because rates based on
