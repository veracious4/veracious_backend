 Methods:           In 2012, 42 states contributed all or a portion of their ambulatory data to the National Emergency Medical Services Information System.
 We used a logistic regression model to measure the association between naloxone administration and emergency medical services certification level, age, gender, geographic location, and patient primary symptom.
 Although the odds of naloxone administration were 23% higher in rural areas than in urban areas, the opioid drug overdose rate is 45% higher in rural communities.
 Conclusions:           Naloxone is less often administered by EMT-basics, who are more common in rural areas.
 In most states, the scope-of-practice model prohibits naloxone administration by basic EMTs.
 Reducing this barrier could help prevent drug overdose death.
