 Relative survival is an estimate of the percentage of patients who would be expected to survive the effects of their cancer.
 It excludes the risk of dying from other causes.
 Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient.
 5-YearRelative Survival 97.8%     Based on data from SEER 18 2010–2016.
 Gray figures represent those who have died from prostate cancer.
 Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.
 Additional Information 			  More about survival statistics Additional prostate cancer survival statistics in SEER*Explorer   Survival by Stage Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival.
 In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is localized (sometimes referred to as stage 1).
 If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is regional or distant.
 For prostate cancer, 75.9% are diagnosed at the local stage.
 The 5-year relative survival for localized prostate cancer is 100.0%.

 Who Gets This Cancer?
 Prostate cancer occurs only in men, and it is more common in older men than younger men.
 It is more likely to occur in men with a family history of prostate cancer and men of African American descent.
 The rate of new cases of prostate cancer was 109.8 per 100,000 men per year based on 2013–2017 cases, age-adjusted.

 Because we have screening for prostate cancer, most of the time it is caught before it spreads to other parts of the body.
 Men who have prostate cancer that is characterized as localized or regional are not as likely to die as men whose cancer is distant.
 In general prostate cancer has excellent survival rates, but death rates are higher in African American men, men who have advanced stage cancer, and men who are between the ages of 75 and 84.
 Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the United States.
 The death rate was 19.0 per 100,000 men per year based on 2014–2018, age-adjusted.

 Using statistical models for analysis, age-adjusted rates for new prostate cancer cases have been falling on average 4.3% each year over 2008–2017.

 Figure: Prostate and Nearby Organs     Figure: Anatomy diagram shows the prostate, urethra, penis, testicle, bladder, lymph nodes, seminal vesicle, and rectum are labeled.
 An inset provides a close-up view of the prostate, urethra, bladder, seminal vesicles, and rectum.
 This cancer forms in tissues of the prostate (a gland in the male reproductive system found below the bladder and in front of the rectum).
 The prostate surrounds the urethra, the tube through which urine flows.
 A healthy prostate is about the size of a walnut.
 If the prostate grows too large, it squeezes the urethra.
 This may slow or stop the normal flow of urine.
 Prostate cancer usually occurs in older men.
