 &ldquo;Bottom line: it&rsquo;s going to get worse,&rdquo; warned Dr. Fauci about the spread of coronavirus, which he said was about 10 times more lethal than the seasonal influenza virus.
 Dr. Redfield talked about the manufacturing and distribution of diagnostic testing kits, which had been in short supply at the time of the hearing.
 Members of both parties accused each other of politicizing the coronavirus, while the health experts warned that the country needs to change its behavior in order to move toward mitigation and containment more vigorously.
 The hearing recessed when the witnesses were called to a meeting at the White House.
 The committee&rsquo;s brief return to postpone until the next day is included in this program.
