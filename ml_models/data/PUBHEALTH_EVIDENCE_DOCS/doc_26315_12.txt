 The total sample size of the combined CPS-BRFSS data for the time period of 1984–2005 is 967,594, while that of the combined CPS-NHIS data for the time period of 1976–2001 is 364,078.
 We find that increases in wages caused by economic expansions are associated with greater consumption of cigarettes in the United States.
 We also find that increases in hours of work caused by economic expansions are associated with more cigarette consumption, but less physical activity and physician visits.
 More importantly, the evidence suggests that most of such effects associated with changes in hours of work can be attributed to the changes at the extensive margin of employment, meaning the changes in employment status, rather than the changes at the intensive margin, meaning changes in hours of work conditional on being employed.
 These findings imply that changes in employment may have heterogeneous impacts on time-intensive and less time-intensive health behaviors and also provide additional evidence on the importance of time in health production, particularly for time-intensive activities.Highlights► Identifies the causal mechanisms that link business cycles to health behaviors.
 ► Uses a structural approach to examine effects of wages and hours of work on health behaviors.
 ► Increases in wages caused by business cycles are related to more cigarette use.
 ► Increases in hours of work are related to more cigarette use, but less physical activity and less physician visits.
