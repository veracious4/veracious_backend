 Jeremiah Wright-Marine and Sailor-Truth!
 Summary of eRumor:The eRumor describes an  African-American man who volunteered for the Marines in 1961 then after  completing his service volunteered to be a Navy corpsman, a career that  won him recognition for his service including being a part of the medical  team at Bethesda Naval Hospital that tended to President Lyndon B. Johnson  after surgery.
 The eRumor contrasts this man’s military service with  the non-military lives of Dick Cheney, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush,  all of whom avoided active military duty.
 The Truth:The Rev.
 Jeremiah Wright was the popular  pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago.
 He became best  known to the country as a whole during the 2008 presidential primary  season.
 He had been Senator and presidential candidate Barack  Obama’s pastor for two decades but controversy erupted because of quotes  from some of his messages.

 The text of this eRumor is drawn from an article published in the Chicago  Tribune in April, 2008.
 It was written by Lawrence Korb and Ian Moss  who are military veterans themselves and work for the Center for American  Progress.
 The article appeared in the aftermath of the Jeremiah  Wright controversy and was titled Factor Military Duty into Criticism.
 The facts in the article do fit with published and biographical  information about Wright.
 It is also true that Dick Cheney, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush avoided  active duty.
