 \"Jack's\" employees say that he criticizes them constantly and gets upset about nitpicky things.
 To verify these grievances, I had discussions with several staff members, followed by meetings with Jack.
 When I encouraged him to read some books on leadership, he ignored my advice.
 I also asked him to meet with employees individually to discuss their concerns, but so far he has failed to do this.
 Although Jack has many good qualities, his managerial and leadership abilities are sorely lacking.
 I don't want to give him a bad performance appraisal, so what else can I do?
 After a thorough investigation, you have concluded that Jack's \"managerial and leadership abilities are sorely lacking,\" yet you are apparently planning to give him a good performance review.
 If this is an example of your own management style, then perhaps you should be reading those leadership books yourself.
 Giving him a satisfactory evaluation would not only send the message that his behavior is acceptable, but also create false documentation which could create future problems.
 Suppose that a nurse or therapist was known to treat patients badly.
 Would you give that person a favorable review?
 If so, you should definitely reconsider your career path.
 But if not, then you get my point.
 \"Harry\" smells so bad that the odor actually lingers after he leaves the room.
 Because our work puts us in direct contact with customers, we believe that Harry might actually be driving business away.
 Our supervisor is in a different location, so he may not be aware of this.
 How should we handle it?
 Because management needs to know about any issues affecting customers, several of you should meet with your supervisor and clearly describe your concerns.
 Since you don't work closely with Harry, you might not realize that he has a serious hygiene problem.
 The odor is so offensive that customers might actually choose not to come here.
 But if he continues his grubby ways, the only remaining alternative is to keep your distance and try to intercept as many customers as possible.
 That alone is a warning sign against early upgrade plans being sold by the four major mobile phone carriers during the past year.
 That's where the convoluted math has always started — with how most U.S. carriers charge their customers.
 Instead of charging for the phone and service separately, they bake into wireless service plans part of the price of the phones.
 Otherwise, you'll continue to pay a monthly service rate that includes a phone subsidy for a device that has long been paid off.
 \"The early upgrade plans are a great way to save money if you don't upgrade,'' he said.
 That's especially true for customers on no-contract plans such as the AT&amp;T Mobile Share Value plan.
 \"If you're going with a no-contract plan, I would definitely do it,\" Abbott said.
 \"The reason people didn't use no-contract plans is they had to buy the phone upfront for, like, $700.
 \"There's less reason to upgrade early than ever before,\" Gikas said.
 That's because smartphones have matured, and most of them are already very good, with few significant missing features.
 They will satisfy most people for about three years, Gikas said.
 Most early upgrade plans require you to pay the full retail price of the phone, but break it into monthly installments, amounting to zero percent interest on the full price of a phone.
 For example, the cost of a $650 iPhone 5s might be divided into 24 payments of about $27 per month.
 Previously, it didn't matter whether you bought a discounted phone or paid for it in full upfront — your monthly service bill would have been the same.
 With early upgrade plans, when you're done paying off the phone, your bill decreases by the amount of your monthly phone installment.
 But you continue to pay less per month than if you were on a traditional two-year contract plan.
 Ironically, early upgrade plans might provide the least value to frequent upgraders, although they offer convenience, experts say.
 For the rapid upgrader, losing out on that money from selling your late-model phone, often for hundreds of dollars, can wipe out savings from the early upgrade plan.
 A new majority on the Hillsborough County Commission could consider new growth policies including higher impact fees, disallowing construction along substandard roads and making it easier for public involvement in rezoning hearings.

 Florida voters voted on Tuesday to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour over six years, which advocates say will benefit hundreds of thousands of workers in the Sunshine State's service-heavy economy but which opponents say will stifle industry growth.
