 Stay Safe.
 Be Well.” toolkit.
 The outdoors are essential to our health and well-being, and this kit provides tools to help encourage and educate communities around getting outside and recreating safely by following new health guidelines.
 We encourage all land managers, communities, and businesses that support outdoor recreation to use these tools to help create a consistent statewide message inviting Wisconsinites to get outside, stay safe, and be well.
 //   All of the pieces included in this toolkit have been approved in partnership with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.
 The posters include a designated spot in the bottom right footer to add your organization or business logo.

 In addition to this toolkit, the Office joined the #RecreateResponsibly coalition, a national group working to help everyone experience the benefits of the outdoors safely during the health crisis.
 Included here are two helpful graphics, visual guides on how to recreate responsibly, in both English and Spanish.
