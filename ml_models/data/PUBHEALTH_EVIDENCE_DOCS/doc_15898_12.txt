Monarch Watch Blog     Monarch Butterfly Recovery Plan Tuesday, March 25th, 2014 at 5:27 pm by Chip Taylor Filed under Monarch Conservation | Comments Off on Monarch Butterfly Recovery Plan The following is a memo outlining a recovery plan for monarch butterflies.
 On 1 March I received an email from a person well connected with monarchs asking me to prepare a document, a prospectus or memo, for business leaders by the end of the day.
 I was told that these persons needed background information about the monarch population along with a rough idea of what would be required to address the loss of milkweed/monarch habitat.
 The memo was prepared in haste and is not inclusive of all the components needed to successfully stabilize and then increase the milkweed habitats that support the monarch population.
 Nevertheless, this document outlines some of the basic issues.
 Hopefully these ideas will be useful in shaping the conversations needed to create a vision and plan as to how best to restore the monarch population.
 The original memo has been rewritten to improve clarity.
 An explanation of the estimated annual loss of habitat has been added as well.
