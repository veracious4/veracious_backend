 This retrospective study was done to see the effects of age on semen quality, a well-known indicator of fertility status.
 Semen parameters of smokers and non-smokers in the study population were also analyzed.
 A sample of 1121 male partners of infertile couples (aged 25-55 years) who came to an infertility clinic for treatment were included into the study.
 In addition to clinical history including lifestyle, medical and occupational details and physical examination, their semen samples were examined.
 Semen volume (ml), sperm concentration (x 10(6)/ml), motility (%), rapidly progressing (%), slowly progressing (%), non-progressive (%) motility and morphology (%) were measured.
