As the society modernized, the law changed to reflect this new way of assessing liability.
 (Doesn't that frame all white people as idiots?
 Isn't that a racist generalization?
 When this happens, the MPS people ask the person \\\\\\\"Specifically what are you trying to do?\\\\\\\" If they continue this behavior, then bad things happen to them and to their families.
 So she is taking advantage of relative freedom in the US to blast perceived slights by white Americans against Chinese, either real or imagined.
 (I haven't figured out how racism against Americans works, but you get the gist of my idea.)
 On many occasions, Chinese have asked me why Americans are allowed to buy guns?
 I explain that this is something which is part of the nation's history, and many Americans think that gun ownership is part of every Americans' basic freedoms, and it has continued that way to the present day.
 (Living in China is all about figuring out where the red lines are, and avoiding them.)
 It's just not my style.
 Moreover, I generally like Quora and its quality.
 It continues to this day.
 A young schoolboy in Texas was lead away in handcuffs today because he committed the terrible crime of bringing a clock with wires coming out of it while being Muslim.
 President Obama rectified the situation by inviting him to the White House.
 The problem with zero tolerance is that it fails to differentiate between different behavior: a person who made a bad judgement and instantly regrets it is treated the same as the worst bigot.
 This is because most non-Chinese cannot effectively differentiate between people of Han Chinese ethnicity, Chinese culture, and the policies of the Chinese government, as well as some silliness which goes on in Chinese society.
 Let me explain why...\\\\\\\" Instead, she chose to write an open letter.
 We should be able to talk about these differences without accusing each other of racism.

 But it is a phenomena that occurs sometimes!
 Do you know which one?
 Yep.
 This job is not a honourable job and can bring few incomes.
 If a truck driver hiited someone and that person was disabled, the driver's family would be in a big trouble.
 A lot of fees to paid for would put this famliy in a tight spot.
 Even so, the vast majority of them chose to take the victim to hospital.
 Just few of them, considering that their child may cannot go to the school any more, their parents may wouldn't get money from them any more, choose to kill the pedestrian, and be set to jail.
 But as we know that, there are a large numbers of people here.
 The insurance here is incomplete.

 This was the case in the 80s, an accident did cost several lifetimes' earnings with wages back then, and injuries to the driver is none vs severe hitting another car.

 That means they know every search you\\\\u2019ve ever done on Google.
 Yup, that\\\\u2019s Google, too.
 They aren\\\\u2019t really a search company anymore \\\\u2013 they\\\\u2019re a tracking company.
 In addition to tracking everything you\\\\u2019ve ever searched for on Google (e.g.
 \\\\u201cweird rash\\\\u201d), Google also tracks every video you\\\\u2019ve ever watched on YouTube.
 (This is just excessive by any measure.
 If you use Google Calendar, they know schedule.
 There\\\\u2019s a pattern here: For all Google products (Hangouts, Music, Drive, etc.
 Simple: as stated, Google isn\\\\u2019t a search company anymore, they\\\\u2019re a tracking company.
 All of these data points allow Google to build a pretty robust profile about you.
 By allowing Google to collect all this info, you are allowing hundreds of thousands of advertisers to bid on serving you ads based on your sensitive personal data.
 Everyone involved is profiting from your information, except you.

 Some answers to this question mentioned some shocking stories, but failed to prove they are true.
 If it is a systematic problem and the police are reluctant to solve them, I am sure there must be a lot of news reports about such murders.
 Believe me, the Chinese journalist are enthusiastic about writing the dirt on the police.
 Is this a systematic problem?
 If so, why?
 The latter is more important, because even you can pay less, it is not a good deal if you will end up being executed----China still has the death penalty.
 If what the article said is true, it is not because of the bad law, like what Marc Bodnick concluded, it is about the dysfunction of the Chinese law system.
 It will never be rational to kill innocent people intentionally.
 Think about it.
 If you are under the same circumstance---- you hit a person, he is alive but seriously injured, and it is very likely you have to pay a huge amount of bill, and what will you do?
 Will you be cold blooded enough to hit the person again so you can pay less?
 Most people will choose not to.
 Is this a systematic problem?
 If so, why?
 Unlike the report claimed, in most cases it mentioned, there was neither eye witness nor video tapes that could prove that the drivers were intentionally hitting the pedestrians again and again, or it has been proved the incident was just a tragic accident.
 Is this a systematic problem?
 If so, why?
 However, his answer provided no evidence that the driver intentionally hit the victim again to make sure he was dead.
 Forensic evidence showed that the victim was double hit, but was it by the same truck?
 Or were there any evidence showing that the second hit was intentional?
 The driver who hit him fled the scene, which means he didn't have to kill the poor guy to make sure he didn't have to pay.
 He said that a lot of truck drivers don't have any insurances, but as far as I know, the truck drivers have all the insurances they need.
 It is a high risk business.
 There is not only the possibility of hitting someone on the road, but also the possibility of being hit by another driver.
 Being a truck driver without any insurances is stupid and reckless and crazy.
 Basically, there is no proved intentionally \\\\u201chit and kill\\\\u201d case in his answer.
 The answer only mentioned three cases of hit-to-kill and jumped to the conclusion of \\\\\\\"Chinese often kills people they hit\\\\\\\".
 Can I say Americans OFTEN kill people?
 Of course not!
 That is racist, just like Marc Bodnik's answer.
 In fact, I am very surprised that this answer has got so much votes.
 People know this kind of thing because it is in the news; but please keep in mind that this kind of stuff makes news for a reason----it is shocking and rare.
 A Chinese hit a person.
 He walked out of his car and found out he had hit a man, causing him to have a sever mental breakdown.
 When police arrived the scene, they found him just twenty meters away from his car, shaking and unable to move or speak.
 After being taken to the police station, he learned that the person he hit had died, then he started repeatedly hitting his head against the wall with all his strength.
 The police had to tie him to a chair and made him wear a helmet.
 He hit his head, not because he wanted to kill himself, but because he was devastated by the fact that he had killed someone.
 Even though he did not kill the person intentionally, he still couldn't take the grieve brought on by the man's death.
 That is how most of us would feel.
 Killing someone is a unbearable burden for normal people.

 The \\\\\\\"pretty serious lawyer\\\\\\\" turned out to be a \\\\\\\"not so serious\\\\\\\" journalist.
 Clearly the journalist believes that since few westerners can read Chinese, it is OK for him to just fake or over-exaggerate the stories.
 And I was stupid enough to just take his word, because I thought journalists were supposed to tell the truth, not the other way around.
 I couldn't believe it!
 This is the man who leads the Quora business and community team!
 Not only did he write a racist answer, he asked a question so he could spread his racist idea!

 You are talking about 6 incidents over the course of 10+ years in a country with over a billion people.
 People in the U.S. get run over deliberately too.
 Suge Knight also intentionally ran over a man near a movie set in California.
 If you actually travel to China, there are so many cars on the road, yet so few accidents.
 The Chinese may be aggressive, but they pay attention.
 That's when accidents happen.

 Am Chinese and I also have foreign friends, but they all visited China, and they were all impressed by Chinese people's hospitality and kindness.
 U guys have never been to China, u know nothing about China but some extreme cases from the internet.
 Yes some drivers in China have killed people, but there is no gun shot case happen in China.
 There are many positive and negative sides in every country.
 Please stop imaging China and understanding China from \\\\\\\"news\\\\\\\".
 If u want to know China, come to China, it won't let you down.
 Otherwise plz shut up and watch your father's AV instead.

 You could almost say that in this kind of situation, drivers in China are indeed the worst type of drivers to ever hit the roads.
 If a driver hits a pedestrian without killing them, the driver must pay compensation to the pedestrian until they basically die.

 Murder is exactly what it is, and worse- premeditated murder, which can include premeditation as little as seconds before.

 It talks about the problem in general terms, gives reasons for it, but offers only a few anecdotes to support it.
 Okay, I fell for it at first, but saw all of these issues upon reading it a second time.
 \\\\n \\\\nI do believe that it happens occasionally, just as it may happen other places.
 I do believe that people think that it's a higher incidence problem than it is.
 I also think that part of it may be related to the fact that car ownership has been less common than in many other places.
 When people think of car owners as \\\\\\\"heartless rich people\\\\\\\", then it's easy to make them \\\\\\\"others\\\\\\\" and start rumors like this.

 Settlements are easier to reach when there are no surviving witness pointing fingers at you.
 It's sad but true that poor people would often accepted the large sum of money instead of pursuing harsher punishments.
 Contrary to public believe of communism where crime and punishment were extreme and harsh, more often than not, justice were blindfolded by bribery.

 Why?
 Because it cost less!
 That is why some truck drivers don't stop when they hit someone (I been hearing this saying among truck drivers).
 If you paralyze someone, you will need to pay his/her medical bills for the rest of his life.
 If you kill him, it'll be much less.
