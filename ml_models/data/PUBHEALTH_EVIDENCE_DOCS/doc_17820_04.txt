 Since the shutdown went into effect, Kirkpatrick has voted against funding for our nation’s veterans, low-income women and children, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health.
 The White House has been rooting for the shutdown, telling reporters that they are “winning” as Americans suffer.
 While President Obama and National Democrats play political games, House Republicans have passed these important funding bills without Kirkpatrick’s support.
 “Ann Kirkpatrick has turned her back on women, children, and our nation’s veterans throughout President Obama’s shutdown, and it’s time for her and her liberal allies to stop the partisan games,” said NRCC Communications Director Andrea Bozek.
 “The House has passed bipartisan bills to help the American people while the shutdown continues, and Kirkpatrick has continued to turn a blind eye to those in need of funding.” You can view the web ad here:  Speaker Boehner told the American people and the White House that the shutdown “isn’t some damn game.” (“Angry Boehner Tells White House Shutdown Isn’t a ‘Damn Game.’” By Jonathan Karl and Devin Dwyer, ABC News, 10/4/13).
 Said a senior administration official: “We are winning…It doesn’t really matter to us” how long the shutdown lasts “because what matters is the end result.” (“White House’s Hard Line on Shutdown, Debt Ceiling Has Risks Attached.” By Carol E. Lee and Peter Nicholas, The Wall Street Journal, 10/4/13).
