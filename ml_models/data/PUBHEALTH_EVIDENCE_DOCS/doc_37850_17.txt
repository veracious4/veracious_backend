Crazy!
 I’m glad Ulta is choosing to support us still!20 commentssharesavehidereport93% UpvotedThis thread is archivedNew comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be castSort bybest  level 17 months agoA lot of my friends share your sentiment, and I really really hope I'm wrong but I have a feeling Ulta will be forced to do the same after April 18.
 With no revenue coming in from the stores, how would they be able to justify continuing to pay their part timers?
 A sacrifice has to be made somewhere.
 But again, I hope I'm wrong and Ulta has the overhead to support all of you indefinitely.
 Best of luck to you and your team!46shareReportSavelevel 2Original Poster7 months agoDefinitely I agree!
 I’m just fortunate that we can live off of my fiancé’s income and still be okay!
 But yes...
 If we don’t reopen soon I have a feeling this is what’s gonna happen too!13shareReportSavelevel 27 months agoI agree too, I’ve been worried about this since the services were suspended.
 Layoffs seem inevitable but stores will reopen at some point and they will need employees again, preferably ones already trained with ulta.5shareReportSavelevel 27 months agoMacy's, Kohl's Gap (includes Old Navy and Banana Republic, JC Penny furloughed most of their employees w/o pay.3shareReportSavelevel 17 months agoJust my personal opinion here but they just gave warehouse workers a $2 raise AND gave us the option of the flat 15/30 or average of 4 weeks.
 Right now, ULTA is putting more money into us so I think on the 18th, if anything they may just switch it back to the flat 15/30 for all.
 Also, with all the backlash Sephora is getting there is NO way ULTA wants to go down that road and Mary and Kecia seem like they have our backs instead of treating us like just a number.
 Idk, maybe I’m just being optimistic but don’t stress over it as of now because stress lowers your immune system that is critical to have right now.
 Good luck and stay safe.10shareReportSavelevel 27 months agoI hope they keep us on, but my real hope is to go to work again, which means this virus needs to go away.
 I sincerely look forward to the day I only have to worry about cold and flu season.4shareReportSavelevel 27 months agoWait... We get to choose whicb pay average we're getting?1shareReportSaveContinue this thread level 17 months agoAre they actually firing or laying off?
 If they are laying off, it's not a bad thing.
 It allows the staff to apply for unemployment.
 Plus the videochat is probably the best way to do it.
 I don't work there so I'm not sure of everything going.8shareReportSavelevel 27 months agowe shouldn’t be praising a multibillion dollar company for shifting the responsibility of caring for their employees to the tax payers.
 in this scenario welfare is corporate welfare if companies can just fire anyone during this crisis for any reason.20shareReportSaveContinue this thread level 17 months agoWow!
 I am so sorry to hear that.
 It's a difficult time for so many people right now.3shareReportSavelevel 17 months agoThis aged very well....2shareReportSaveView Entire Discussion (20 Comments)More posts from the Ulta communityContinue browsing in r/Ultar/UltaWelcome to Ulta7.5kMembers100OnlineCreated Mar 10, 2014JoinhelpReddit AppReddit coinsReddit premiumReddit giftsaboutcareerspressadvertiseblogTermsContent policyPrivacy policyMod policyReddit Inc © 2020.

 Allows for social distancing, illegal to fire over the phone, better than an email.
