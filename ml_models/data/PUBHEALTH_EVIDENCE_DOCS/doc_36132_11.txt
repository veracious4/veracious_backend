You see somebody and go you're an illegal alien and they find you $250000 No, it's more like if you're in Starbucks and a guy comes in and he tries to order a drink and you say hey, we're not gonna serve you You will legal alien That is a violation However I must stress This is a terrifying prospect It means that if you're a landlord and someone tries renting from you and you say listen I cannot rent to an illegal alien Oh boom There it is human rights Because apparently immigration status is protected but let's read, I wanna make sure so from the New York Post, they say city bans calling someone an illegal alien out of hate It is now against the law in New York City to threaten someone with a call to immigration authorities or refer to them as an Eagle alien.
 When motivated by hate in the instance of public accommodation, please New York Post Can you put it in there?

 Come on you guys the restrictions violations of which are punishable by fines of up to $250000 per offense Our outline today 2000 Page directive released by City Halls Commission on Human Rights Alien used in many laws to refer to a non citizen person is a term that may carry negative connotations and dehumanize immigrants marking them as other reads One passage of the memo No it's the legal term That's the legal term for for somebody, not from here the use of certain language including illegal alien and illegals with the intense to demean humiliate or offend a person or person constitutes discrimination You can't even call them illegals What is this The directive goes onto list several examples of acts and comments they would run a fall of the reflection including addressing people over their actions or grass with english or thing for that our call to immigration and customs enforcement as i told him he is an example this time hotel private house keeper some speaking sparsh walk cleaning because it would offend hotel guest or make them uncomfortable that's a legal that's oh that's crazy they made a legal listen if i am in hotel and people stand with us Different language that makes me uncomfortable It's not it's not it's not it's not about this language if I'm sitting somewhere and someone leans over and whispering that makes me uncomfortable it's about obfuscation information It's about withholding information and you don't know why you don't know what they're saying and you don't know what what what concern it could be it to you So what if if if they I think it's getting to the point where in New York City they are trying to create so many protections they'll actually start Away let's invert the scenario Would it be against the law now to stop someone from speaking English around somebody who speaks Spanish I think the answer is yes it is think about it Let's say there's a let's say let's invert the situation You have a Spanish speaking guest and you have somebody who's speaking English so you say listen the guests don't don't don't understand that language and we preferred if you would speak Spanish and then they say no you can't you can't do that You see the problem I I I I would expect that the city is gonna enforce.
 It's only one direction of course.
 That's how the game is played but what about a circumstance where the guests only speak Spanish is it been appropriate for the for your your employees who also speaks Spanish Cannot speak Spanish Think about it If you have staff or bilingual and by bilingual and Spanish-speaking guest speak the language be polite An Indian immigrant family complains their landlord about mold and cockroaches in their unit The landlord tells them to just deal with it and threatened to call ICE File a complaint in housing court.
 Well that my friends is a slum lord that's disgusting but how about someone complains about something in the House That's not legitimate Let's say you end up inadvertently with a tenant who brings in illegal actually let let let's talk about squatting.
 Okay you could rent You can rent a property move someone without telling the landlord If they're there for a short amount of time they're legal residents and you can't evict them even though you never agreed to it Yup Tell Squatty works There have been stories where people have broken into homes squat there When the owner finds out or the Bank funds or whatever you can do them they are now legal residents.
 In fact, people have been doing it in Chicago for a while because a lot of his investment properties go vacant for a long time and so there was one famous story where I just walked in to a House that was like a half a million - dollar home and they couldn't get rid of em and the only reason he got in trouble not for squatting.
 What was because he he turned on the water pipe in the basement?
 Well there it is, but anyway, here's the point Let's say you now own that House and the people are complaining and they're saying We're gonna do this for us or else and you say no I'm gonna call Ice boom Human rights violation This is insane Okay Did you know that in New York City a business Cannot discriminate based on your gender expression This is why I think everything York has been doing it and how they're expanding is is very troublesome What is gender expression It means you can dress or act any way you want You can't divine what gender is The law is inspired by a couple of things One that gender is a social construct Meaning whether you choose to wear a dress or not makes no difference, but it's also designed to protect actual trans people who are you know transitioning think about the the inherent conundrum in how this law is now going to be an active You could have somebody who is not transitioning but claim that there a certain gender and you can't tell them you have an expectation of how a gender is supposed to appear because gender doesn't exist Therefore someone's gender expression could be them walking around naked hypothetically It could be them walking around dressed up like Winnie the Pooh and you can't tell them No, because the law specifically outlines you Cannot discriminate based on the clothes they wear what they call themselves Someone could literally call themselves when he the poo and say their poop gender and you must adhere to it now again I've talked I've mentioned this before.
 Can I talk to a lawyer about it And I said judge would laugh it out of the courtroom How what gives the judge the right to determine gender or or offense How do you know if it's in hate Look they say if it's motivated by hate how do you know it's motivated by hate if I'm so you're saying I'm at Starbucks and someone says I'd like to buy coffee and I'd say well that's great You're a legal alien and then you go and do it.
 Are you gonna get in trouble for that but there's no hate right Let's read a little more A store owner tells two friends who are speaking tie while shopping in his store to speak English and go back to your country reads a third Okay.
 What about the first one speak English If people are walking around in your storm, they're whispering and murdering to each other and say hey I don't know you're talking about that shady business That's okay but if they're talking about something in a different language skating what they're saying Look, I get it It's it's complicated right I think for the most part.
 No one 's gonna care.
 If you're walking around speaking whatever language you want but in the instance of of hotel, you know Housekeepers being told they that you can't.
 You can't tell them to speak English That's shocking to me because guests won't know what they're saying like think about if the housekeeper went to them and said you know like I don't know how to say anything in Spanish, I can't speak enough Spanish to actually say something say but let's say the housekeeper said something in Spanish like do you want me to change the the the the the the the the garbage bag and the person says I don't speak And then they walk away and don't clean it then the guest calls and says What's going on nobody they didn't.
 They didn't clean up So what the manager can't say Hey, can you speak to them in English next time?
 That's a hate crime What I don't understand what they think they're trying to accomplish with this insane laws in the face of increasingly hostile National Veteran We will do everything in our power to make sure our treasured immigrant communities are able to live with dignity and respect free from harassment and bias said Carmela Morales the agency's Commissioner The directive comes months after Mayor Bill de Blasio vocally opposed coordinated raids by ice Meanwhile, on Thursday the mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs announced a joint one million - dollar investment with the state to guaranteed legal services to immigration to immigrants facing imminent deportation Okay.
 Now I just want to mainly debunk that people seem to think if you as an individual do that you'll get in trouble you won't.
 However this stuff still puts it in the realm of hate crimes depending on what else you do, but here's the It's an erosion if businesses can't say we don't serve non citizens if hotels can't say please speak English for English.
 Speaking guests then slowly overtime they are doing more and more to accommodate those who are not citizens to this country There's going to be a backlash.
 I assure you people of New York will not accept it but I gotta admit you know it It is an increasing problem.
