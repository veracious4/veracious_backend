difference in prevalence between men and women at any age. Overall, adults aged 60 and over 

in obesity prevalence by age. Among women, however, 42.3% of those aged 60 and over were 
obese compared with 31.9% of women aged 20Œ39 (Figure 1).The prevalence of obesity was higher among adolescents than among preschool-aged children 
(Figure 2). The prevalence of obesity was higher among boys than girls (18.6% of boys and 

15.0% of girls were obese).1Significant increasing linear trend by age (

Almost 41 million women and more than 37 million men aged 20 and over were obese in 2009Œ2010 (Figure 3). Among children and adolescents aged 2Œ19, more than 5 million girls and 

approximately 7 million boys were obese.SOURCE: CDC/NCHS, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009Œ2010.

Between 1999Œ2000 and 2009Œ2010, the prevalence of obesity increased among men but not among women.In 1999Œ2000, 27.5% of men were obese, and by 2009Œ2010 the prevalence had increased  
2009Œ2010 (35.8%). In 1999Œ2000, the prevalence of obesity was higher in women than in men. Between 1999Œ2000 and 2009Œ2010, the difference in the prevalence of obesity between men 

and women decreased so that in 2009Œ2010, the prevalence of obesity in men was virtually equal 
to that in women (Figure 4

SummaryThe most recent national data on obesity prevalence among U.S. adults, adolescents, and  children show that more than one-third of adults and almost 17% of children and adolescents were obese in 2009Œ2010. Differences in prevalence between men and women diminished 
between 1999Œ2000 and 2009Œ2010, with the prevalence of obesity among men reaching the  same level as that among women.Age differences in obesity prevalence varied between men and women. The prevalence of obesity 
was higher among older women compared with younger women, but there was no difference by 
age in obesity prevalence among men. Among children and adolescents, the prevalence of obesity 
was higher among adolescents than among preschool-aged children.There has been no change in obesity prevalence in recent years; however, over the last decade 
women and girls overall. The Healthy People 2010 goals of 15% obesity among adults and 5% 
obesity among children were not met (6).Obesityor equal to 30 (1Table

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) conducted from 1999 through 

2010 were used for these analyses. NHANES is a cross-sectional survey designed to monitor the 
health and nutritional status of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population (8). The survey 
consists of interviews conducted in participants™ homes, standardized physical examinations 
conducted in mobile examination centers, and laboratory tests utilizing blood and urine specimens 

provided by participants during the physical examination. 
The NHANES sample is selected through a complex multistage probability design that includes 
selection of primary sampling units (counties), household segments within the counties, households 

non-Hispanic black and Hispanic persons, persons with low income, and those aged 60 and over 
were oversampled in order to obtain reliable estimates of health and nutritional measures for these 
Each year of data collection is based on a representative sample covering all ages of the civilian 
 
Sample weights, which account for the differential probabilities of selection, nonresponse, and 
noncoverage, are incorporated into the estimation process. All variance estimates accounted for the 
complex survey design by using Taylor series linearization. 
Estimates of the number of obese individuals were calculated using the average Current Population 

CPS.htm).
Prevalence estimates for the total adult population were age adjusted using the direct method to 
the 2000 U.S. Census population using the age groups 20Œ39, 40Œ59, and 60 and over. Differences 
between groups were tested using a univariate t statistic at the p
made for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS System for 

Windows (release 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) and SUDAAN (release 9.0; RTI International, 
Research Triangle Park, N.C.).
