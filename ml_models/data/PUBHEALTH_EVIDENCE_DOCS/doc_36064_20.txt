 Leave the fawn alone         Cathy M.

 This is the first time I have written about fawns, those adorable baby deer.
 Apparently, between April and September, Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation, Inc. (WRR) receives a steady stream of fawns, either injured or thought to be orphaned, from area residents.
 Last year, WRR received more than 350 fawns.
 While some of these fawns were injured or orphaned, most were healthy fawns who had been unintentionally orphaned by well-meaning humans.
 Those people spotted a fawn alone under a shady tree one day with no mom in sight for hours.
 They may have acted that same day or waited one more day after seeing the fawn still without its mother before “rescuing” the fawn.
 WRR says, however, that a doe may leave her fawn for up to 14 hours a day to forage for food, so you could literally never see the mom during your waking hours of the day, any day of the week.
 And when people don’t know this, they kidnap the fawn and take it away from its mother, mistakenly thinking they’re heloing, said Ava Donaldson, a spokeswoman for WRR.
 “(Fawns) need to be left alone unless there is clear reason to rescue them,” she said.
 Here are some questions to ask yourself before “rescuing” a fawn.
 Is the fawn lying quietly in the grass?
 A fawn who is still being cared for by her mother will usually be calm and lying down.
 If a fawn is spooked or frightened by humans or dogs, she may get up and move but will usually lie back down a short distance away.
 Is the fawn lying upright?
 Healthy fawns lie in a sternal position with their front legs tucked under their chest.
 A fawn lying on her side is likely in distress.
 Is the fawn in a dangerous location, like a road or driveway or exposed to the sun?
 WRR recommends you gently move the fawn to a safe, shaded location within 20 yards of its original hiding place, so the doe can find her baby again.
 If you find a fawn alone, call WRR’s 24-hour hotline at 830-336-2725 to discuss the situation before moving or disturbing the fawn.
 What happens to healthy fawns at WRR?
 “They are quickly put with other fawns of a similar age so they can learn species-specific behaviors and are not habituated to humans,” Donaldson said.
 “A big part of that is not speaking around them so they don’t hear human voices.” When the fawns are ready to go out on their own, WRR releases them.
 “But they never do quite as well as they would have done if they had been left with their mothers,” Donaldson said.
 So, call WRR before you go into rescue mode.
