average increase of 5% per year. The rate increased on average by 9% per year from 1999 to 

2006, by 2% per year from 2006 to 2013, and by 12% per year from 2013 to 2015. For females, the rate increased from 3.9 per 100,000 in 1999 to 11.8 in 2015, an overall 

average increase of 6% per year. The rate increased on average by 11% per year from 1999 

to 2006 and by 4% per year from 2006 to 2015.Adults aged 45Œ54 had the highest rate of drug overdose deaths in 2015. The rates of drug overdose deaths increased from 1999 to 2015 for all age groups (Figure 2). The greatest percentage increase occurred in the drug overdose death rate for adults aged 
55Œ64, from 4.2 per 100,000 in 1999 to 21.8 in 2015, an average increase of 10.5% per year. 
 In 2015, adults aged 45Œ54 had the highest death rate from drug overdose at 30 deaths per 
100,000.  In 2015, rates for adults aged 25Œ34, 35Œ44, 45Œ54, and 55Œ64 were more than twice the rate 

for younger adults aged 15Œ24, and more than 3.5 times the rate for adults aged 65 and over.

In 2015, the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths among non-Hispanic 
white persons was nearly 3.5 times the rate in 1999. In 2015, non-Hispanic white persons had a higher age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths (21.1 per 100,000) than non-Hispanic black (12.2) and Hispanic (7.7) persons (p < 0.001) (Figure 3). From 1999 to 2015, the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths among non-Hispanic 
white persons increased from 6.2 to 21.1 per 100,000, an average increase of 7% per year. 
 Rates also increased for non-Hispanic black persons from 7.5 in 1999 to 12.2 in 2015, an 
average increase of 2% per year. 
 Rates for Hispanic persons increased from 5.4 in 1999 to 7.7 in 2015, an average increase of 
2% per year.

In 2015, 21 states had age-adjusted drug overdose rates that were statistically higher than the national rate.  In 2015, the four states with the highest age-adjusted drug overdose death rates were West 
Virginia (41.5 per 100,
000), New Hampshire (34.3), Kentucky (29.9), and Ohio (29.9) (Figure 4). Other states with rates that were statistically higher than the national rate of 16.3 per 
100,000 included Rhode Island (28.2), Pennsylvania (26.3), Massachusetts (25.7), New 
Mexico (25.3), Utah (23.4), Tennessee (22.2), Connecticut (22.1), Delaware (22.0), Maine

In 2015, the percentage of drug overdose deaths involving heroin was triple the percentage in 2010.  Deaths from drug overdose involving heroin tripled from 8% in 2010 to 25% in 2015 (Figure 5).  For drug overdose deaths involving natural and semisynthetic opioid analgesics, which 
include drugs such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, the percentage decreased from 29% in 
2010 to 24% in 2015. The percentage of drug overdose deaths involving methadone also decreased, from 12% in 
2010 to 6% in 2015. For drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, which include 
drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol, the percentage increased from 8% in 2010 to 18% in 
2015. The percentage of drug overdose deaths involving cocaine increased from 11% in 2010 to 

13% in 2015. Drug overdose deaths involving psychostimulants with abuse potential, which include drugs 
such as methamphetamine, increased from 5% in 2010 to 11% in 2015.
Figure 5. Percentage of drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories: United States, 2010, 2014, and 2015NOTES: Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes X40ŒX44, X60ŒX64, X85, and Y10ŒY14. The total number of drug overdose deaths was 38,329 in 2010; 47,055 in 2014; and 52,404 in 2015.
 Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple-cause-of-death codes: heroin, T40.1; natural and semisynthetic opioids, T40.2; methadone, T40.3; synthetic opioids excluding methadone, T40.4; cocaine, T40.5; and psychostimulants with abuse potentia
l, T43.6. Categories are not mutually exclusive because deaths may involve more than one drug. The percentage of drug overdose deaths lacking information on the specific drugs involved
 varied by year: 25% in 2010, 19% in 2014, and 17% in 2015. Access data table for Figure 5 at:

SummaryThis report updates statistics on deaths from drug overdoses in the United States and includes information on trends since 1999 as well as key statistics for 2015. Rates of drug overdose deaths continued to increase. In 2015, the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths (16.3 per 100,000) was more than 2.5 times the rate in 1999 (6.1). Increases were seen for both males (from 8.2 in 1999 to 20.8 in 2015) and females (from 3.9 in 1999 to 11.8 in 

2015). Rates increased for all age groups, with the largest percentage increase seen for adults aged 


100,000 in 1999 to 21.8 in 2015. Since 2005, rates have been highest for adults aged 45Œ54. Although rates increased 63% for non-Hispanic black persons (from 7.5 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12.2 in 2015) and 43% for Hispanic persons (from 5.4 in 1999 to 7.7 in 2015), non-Hispanic 
white persons experienced the greatest increase between 1999 and 2015. The age-adjusted rate of 

drug overdose deaths among non-Hispanic white persons increased 240% from 6.2 per 100,000 in 
1999 to 21.1 in 2015. The pattern of drugs involved in drug overdose deaths also has changed in recent years. In 2010, 29% of drug overdose deaths involved natural and semisynthetic opioids and 12% involved 
methadone. In 2015, the percentage of drug overdose deaths involving these drugs decreased to 
24% and 6%, respectively. In contrast, drug overdose deaths involving heroin increased from 8% 

in 2010 to 25% in 2015. Increases also were seen in drug overdose deaths involving synthetic 
opioids other than methadone, from 8% in 2010 to 18% in 2015.Drug poisoning (overdose) deaths: Include deaths resulting from unintentional or intentional 
overdose of a drug, being given the wrong drug, taking a drug in error, or taking a drug 

inadvertently. 
Natural and semisynthetic opioid analgesics: Include such drugs as morphine, codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone. 
Synthetic opioids, excluding methadone: Include such drugs as fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and tramadol. 
Psychostimulants with abuse potential: Include such drugs as methamphetamine, amphetamine, Ecstasy).

Revision (ICDŒ10) underlying-cause-of-death code of X40ŒX44 (unintentional), X60ŒX64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10ŒY14 (undetermined intent). Of the drug overdose deaths in 
2015, 84% were unintentional, 10% were suicides, 6% were of undetermined intent, and less 
than 1% were homicides. The type of drug(s) involved are indicated by ICDŒ10 multiple-cause-

of-death codes: heroin (T40.1); natural and semisynthetic opioids (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); 
synthetic opioids excluding methadone (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with 
abuse potential (T43.6). Age-adjusted death rates were calculated using the direct method and adjusted to the 2000 standard population (6). Data for Hispanic origin should be interpreted with caution (7).

Additionally, drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might 
be included in more than one category when describing the percentage of drug overdose deaths 

included in both the percentage of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the percentage of 
drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids excluding methadone. About the authorsand Epidemiology. Margaret Warner and Arialdi M. Miniño are with the NCHS Division of Vital
