Beginning April 19, your role will transition from catastrophe compensation coverage to a temporary furloughed status.
 This means you will be placed on a temporary unpaid leave of absence from work which will end when it is safe to reopen our stores.One of the most important points we want to make is that you have the opportunity to apply and earn more money through government funds than what you are currently being paid through Ulta Beauty.
 This is based on the recent Federal Care Act which just recently went into effect which allows each associate to receive up to $600 per week in addition to half your weekly wage.
 So while we cannot tell you how to personally handle this, we strongly encourage you to look into the opportunity as soon as possible.
 You can find details on how to do this within a new resource document that will be posted to WorkJam this afternoon.A few other things to take note of is that any of you currently receiving health benefits through Ulta Beauty will continue to do so and none of you will need to be rehired.
 Instead, we will be able to call you and welcome you back to work when we reopen.As you can imagine this has been an incredibly tough decision for the Ulta Beauty leadership team to make, but they ultimately wanted our associates to receive the best financial stability during this time as well as protect the business so we remain strong and continue to employ every member of our associate base when our stores reopen again.
 Mary and Keisha will share their thoughts in WorkJam this afternoon.I also want to mention that our store and salon management team, with the exception of our MSC and our Master and Elite stylists, will not be part of this furlough so we will be able to stay connected to business updates and keep you informed as needed in addition to ensuring a smooth transition of store and salon reopenings.
 We shared this news with them before this so they can be a resource during this time.While there is no known reopen date available at this time, please note that our leaders are working to ensure that we reopen our doors and get our whole team back together to serve our guests as soon as we are able to do this.
