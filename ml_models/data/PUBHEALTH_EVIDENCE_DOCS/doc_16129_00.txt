   Chapter 1
- GENERAL INFORMATION
  (Change)
 1.1.2.  Pride in an Airman™s personal appearance and wearing of the uniform greatly 
enhances the esprit
-de-corps essential to an effective military force. Therefore, it is most important 
for all Airmen to maintain a high standard of dress and personal app
earance. The five elements of 
this standard are neatness, cleanliness, safety, uniformity, and military image. The first four are 

absolute, objective criteria needed for the efficiency and well
-being of the Air Force.  The fifth, 
military image, is subject
ive, but necessary.  Appearance in uniform is an important part of military 
image. Judgment on the proper image differs in and out of the military. The American public and its 

elected representatives draw certain conclusions on military effectiveness based
 on the image 
Airmen present.  
The image of a disciplined and committed Airman instills public confidence that 

Airmen live by a common standard and respond to military order and discipline. 
 Every Airman has 

a responsibility to maintain an ﬁacceptable mili
tary image,ﬂ as well as the right, within limits, to 

express individuality through his or her appearance.
 
 
(Change)
 1.2.1.  Except when authorized to wear civilian clothes, Airmen will wear the appropriate 
Air Force uniform while performing military duties
.  Name tapes/tags will reflect the member™s 
legal last name as spelled on the military identification card and may include diacritical accents and 

hyphens. If a diacritical accent is used, all letters should be the same height (e.g., PEÑA 

SANCHEZ, LEWIS
-MILES, or MÜLLER).
  Chapter 2 
ŒROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
  (Change)
 2.10.1.  Enforces dress and personal appearance standards in accordance with 
Department of Defense and Air Force instruction for wear of military uniforms or civilian clothes 
when authorize
d to be worn on
-duty. 
  Chapter 3 
Œ GROOMING AND APPEARANCE STANDARDS
  (Change)
 3.1.  Personal Grooming Standards. This chapter outlines personal grooming while 
wearing any Air Force uniform or civilian clothing in an official capacity.  Commander™s discretion 
may be used to determine if individual™s personal grooming is within standards of 
this instruction.  

The personal grooming standards listed are minimum standards that represent common appearance 

issues and are 
not 
all
-inclusive.  Although Airmen have the right, within established limits, to 
express their individuality through their appe
arance, the Air Force has defined what is and what is 
not an acceptable, professional military image for Airmen.  Except for minor variations based on 
gender differences, all Air Force personnel must comply with the same personal grooming 
standards.  Super
visors have the responsibility to determine compliance with this AFI and to correct 
the obvious violations regardless of whether the situation identified is clearly written in this AFI.  

Commanders do 
not 
have authority to waive grooming and appearance sta
ndards except as 
identified in this instruction.
  
(Change)
 3.1.1. Hair

-groomed, present a professional 
appearance, allow proper wear of headgear, helmet or chemical mask and conform to safety

  moisturizer), appear lopsided, touch either eyebrow, or end below an imaginary line across the 
forehead at the top of the eyebrows that is parallel to the ground. If applied, dyes, tints,
 bleaches 

and frostings must result in natural hair colors. Examples of natural hair colors are brown, blonde, 

brunette, natural red, black or grey.  All Airmen are authorized to wear hair in a natural color 

regardless of their natural born hair color.  Pr
ohibited hair color examples (
not 
all inclusive) are 
burgundy, purple, orange, fluorescent or neon colors.

radiation/chemoth
erapy).
  
(Change)
 3.1.2. Hair
-Male. Tapered appearance on both sides and the back of the head, both with 
and without headgear. A tapered appearance is one that when viewed from any angle outlines the 

member's hair so that it conforms to the shape of the head, curving inward
 to the natural termination 

point without eccentric directional flow, twists or spiking. A block
-cut is permitted with tapered 
appearance.  Hair will 
not 
exceed 2 inches in bulk, regardless of length and ¼ inch at natural 

termination point; allowing only c
losely cut or shaved hair on the back of the neck to touch the 
collar.  Hair will not touch the ears or protrude under the front band of headgear. Cleanly shaven 

heads, military high

wear authorized for religious reasons are governed by 
Attachment 8 
of this instruction. When 

authorized for medical reasons, members will keep all facia
l hair trimmed not to exceed ¼ inch in 
length. Individuals granted a shaving waiver may shave or trim their facial hair to present a neat, 

clean, professional image but will not shave or trim in such a manner as to give a lined/shaped 

appearance. Commander
s and supervisors will monitor progress in treatment to control these 
waivers. If necessary for medical reasons, facial hair will be kept neat and conservative (moderate, 

being within required limits (not more than ¼ inch); not excessive or extreme). Durin
g tours of less 
than 30 days, Air Force Reserve (AFR) and Air National Guard (ANG) chaplains not on extended 

active duty may request a beard waiver for religious observance when consistent with their faith.

GENERAL INFORMATION
 
1.1.
 
 
Basic Philosophy.
 
1.1.1.
 
 
The Air 
Force philosophy is that the uniform will be plain, distinctive, and standardized.  
This standardization includes a minimum and maximum number of authorized badges, 
insignia, and devices.
 
1.1.2.
 
 

uniform greatly enhances 
the esprit
-
de
-
corps essential to an effective military force.  Therefore, it is most important for 
all Airmen to maintain a high standard of dress and personal appearance.  The five elements 
of this standard are neatness, cleanline
ss, safety, uniformity, and military image.  The first four 
are absolute, objective criteria needed for the efficiency and well
-
being of the Air Force.  The 
fifth, military image, is subjective, but necessary.  Appearance in uniform is an important part 
of
 
military image. Judgment on the proper image differs in and out of the military.  The 
American public and its elected representatives draw certain conclusions on military 
effectiveness based on the image Airmen present.  The image must instill public conf
idence 
and leave no doubt that Airmen live by a common standard and respond to military order and 
discipline.  The image of a disciplined and committed Airman is incompatible with the 
extreme, the unusual, and the faddish. Every Airman has a responsibility
 
to maintain an 

his or her appearance.
 
1.1.3.
 
 
Airmen project a military image, and make an impression on those around them, in large 
part by how they wear t
heir uniforms.  The Air Force emphasizes, a neat, clean, and 
professional image.  Members have a responsibility to keep their uniform clean, pressed (see 
instructions for Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) and Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) 
Uniforms) and in
 
good repair.  Members are responsible for knowing authorized uniform 
combinations and correct placement of ribbons, insignia, badges and other uniform items.
 
1.1.4.
 
 
Commanders do not have the authority to waive grooming and appearance standards 
except as
 
identified in 
paragraph 3.1.2.3
 
of this instruction.
 
1.2.
 
 
Wear of the Air Force Uniform.
 
1.2.1.
 
 
Except when authorized to wear civilian clothes, Airmen will wear the appropriate Air 
Force uniform while performing milit
ary duties.  Name tape/tag will reflect legal last name (to 
include multiple last names) on military identification card (e.g., Trejo Sanchez, Trejo
-
Sanchez, or TrejoSanchez).
 
1.2.2.
 
 
Airmen assigned to non
-
Air Force organizations will wear the Air Force e
quivalent of 
the order of dress prescribed.  For example, if the non
-
Air Force organization prescribes a 
utility uniform as the uniform of the day, assigned Airmen may wear either the ABU or the 
OCP until OCP wear is mandatory on 1 April 2021.
 
1.2.3.
 
 
Airm
en attending a military event, either social or official, must wear the appropriate 
uniform or civilian attire as requested by the host/hostess or directed by the commander.

AFI36
-
2903  7 FEBRUARY 2020
 
1.2.4.
 
 
Commanders will not direct the wear of optional items unless they are prov
ided at no 
cost to Airmen.  Commanders will not prohibit the wear of optional items, except when 
uniformity is required as identified in 
paragraph 2.10.5
 
of this instruction. 
(T
-
1).
 
1.2.5.
 
 
Airmen may alter uniform clothin
g to improve fit.  Airmen may wear taps on their 
authorized uniform boots and shoes to preserve the heels as long as the taps do not change the 
intended appearance of the boots and/or shoes.
 
1.2.6.
 
 
Airmen discharged for bad conduct, undesirability, unsuit
ability, inaptitude, or other 
than honorably will not wear the Air Force uniform upon discharge.
 
1.2.7.
 
 
While portraying a member of the Air Force, an actor in a theatrical or motion
-
picture 
production may wear the uniform of the Air Force if the portraya
l does not tend to discredit 
the Armed Forces.  Refer to Title 10 United States Code (USC) Section 772 (f).
 
1.2.8.
 
 
While attending a course of military instruction conducted by the Army, Navy, Air 
Force, or Marine Corps, a civilian, in accordance with Tit
le 10 USC Section 772 (h), may wear 
the Air Force uniform equivalent to the uniform prescribed by that armed force if the wear of 
such uniform is authorized by the Air Education and Training Command Commander or sister 
service equivalent.  If worn, civilia
ns will conform to the same standards of appearance, 
practices, and conduct in uniform prescribed for active duty members.
 
1.2.9.
 
 
An instructor or member of the organized cadet corps of a state university or college, a 
public high school, or an educationa
l institution having a regular course of military instruction 
in military science and tactics from a member of the Air Force may prescribe wear of an Air 
Force uniform if it includes distinctive insignia prescribed by the Secretary of the Air Force 
(SecAF)
 
to distinguish it from the uniform worn by Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National 
Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve (AFR) Airmen.  The uniform prescribed will not include 
insignia of rank the same as, or similar to, those prescribed for officers in the 
Army, Navy, Air 
Force, or Marine Corps.
 
1.2.10.
 
 
Officers are authorized to wear the rank insignia of the next higher rank if they have 


t higher rank.  For Air National Guard (ANG) State Adjutant 
Generals, see 
paragraph 11.2.5

express their individuality through their appearance, the Air Fo
rce has defined what is and what is 
not an acceptable, professional military image for Airmen.  Except for minor variations based on 
gender differences, all Air Force personnel must comply with the same personal grooming 
standards.  Supervisors have the re
sponsibility to determine compliance with this AFI and to 
correct the obvious violations regardless of whether the situation identified is clearly written in 
this AFI. Commanders do 
not 
have authority to waive grooming and appearance standards except 
as id
entified in this instruction.   Grooming and appearance standards must be conservative 
(moderate, being within reasonable limits; not excessive or extreme) and not present a faddish
