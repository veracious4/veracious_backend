 Subscribe to OregonLive.PortlandPolice, prosecutors urged to use laws to keep guns away from domestic abusersUpdated Jan 10, 2019; Posted Feb 04, 2011 Facebook ShareTwitter ShareBy       Maxine Bernstein | The Oregonian/OregonLive      As detectives investigated a domestic murder-suicide Friday in Northeast Portland, state and federal prosecutors gathered across town to learn how to use federal laws to keep guns out of the hands of abusers.
 The OregonianU.S.
 Attorney in Oregon Dwight Holton"Just a few hours ago, a man and a woman were found dead, the latest victims of Oregon's domestic violence,"U.S. Attorney Dwight Holton told police, prosecutors and victim advocates at the federal courthouse in downtown Portland.
 "Guns and domestic violence are a dangerous mix that's killing more and more.
 "It's a federal crime for people convicted of certain state domestic violence misdemeanors to possess a gun or ammunition.
 The list includes state convictions for fourth-degree assault and strangulation.Federal prosecutors don't routinely file those cases in Oregon, though.But with domestic violence shootings a persistent problem in Oregon and the nation, Holton challenged police and prosecutors to help establish the necessary criteria in state court to permit more federal prosecutions.
 "I want you to leave here with a mission and go forth now to establish these domestic violence predicates ... so we can help by taking that guy or gal off the streets for a long, long time," Holton said.Margaret Groban, a federal prosecutor in Maine who provides training to U.S. attorney's offices nationwide on federal domestic violence laws, cited national statistics that show about one-third of all women killed are murdered by intimate partners and that the majority of the killings involve guns.
 "That's why it's critically important to keep guns out of the hands of people the U.S. Congress has determined are too dangerous to have guns," Groban said.Her office has prosecuted cases for interstate violation of a protective order as well as possession of a firearm while subject to a restraining order, she said.Oregon law poses a hiccup for federal prosecution of people with guns who face a protective order.Federal prosecution can't proceed without a state court hearing held or at least scheduled before a protection order is granted.
 Oregon is one of the few states where temporary protective orders can turn into a full protective order without a hearing.Yet Holton signaled that he's willing to pursue a test case.
 Further, prosecutors said if a hearing was scheduled and the subject of a temporary restraining order did not appear, that would be sufficient to proceed with a federal case prosecuting the person for possessing a gun.
 "The key to bringing down domestic violence assaults and homicides is prevention," Holton said.
 "That's precisely what the federal firearms statutes are intended to do.
 "In Maine, Groban said the U.S. Attorney's Office learns of every gun case prosecuted in state court, "so we know whether to prosecute them federally.
 "Oregon's Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Weinhouse, who handles federal gun prosecutions, said he obtains reports on all felons-in-possession-of-gun cases in Multnomah County.The domestic violence gun cases that come before him now are mostly referred to him from local law enforcement agencies, but it's not done enough, Weinhouse said.
 "That's the purpose of this conference," he said.
 "To spread the word, and make law enforcement more aware of it.
 "In 2002, Weinhouse prosecuted a man who had been convicted in state court for a domestic violence-related fourth-degree assault and later was found with a .22-caliber gun during a traffic stop.
 He was prosecuted in federal court for unlawfully possessing a firearm having been convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense and was sent to prison for 24 months.In Oregon, 26,265 people between 2000 and 2010 were unable to buy guns after background checks requested by either a private seller or federal firearms dealer.
 The Oregon State Police Firearms Instant Check program conducts the background checks.Of those, 8 percent or 2,140, were denials to people who had a domestic violence conviction, and 3.7 percent or 945, were denials to people who faced a domestic violence restraining order.Last year alone, there were 168,259 gun transactions in Oregon, said Dianne Holmes, program manager for the Oregon Firearms Instant Check program.
 She said Black Friday and Valentine's Day are among the busiest days for gun purchases in the state; Easter is the slowest.She urged police and prosecutors to carefully document their domestic violence cases.
