 I’m glad Ulta is choosing to support us still!20 commentssharesavehidereport94% UpvotedThis thread is archivedNew comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be castSort bybest  level 146 points · 7 months agoA lot of my friends share your sentiment, and I really really hope I'm wrong but I have a feeling Ulta will be forced to do the same after April 18.
 With no revenue coming in from the stores, how would they be able to justify continuing to pay their part timers?
 A sacrifice has to be made somewhere.
 But again, I hope I'm wrong and Ulta has the overhead to support all of you indefinitely.
 Best of luck to you and your team!level 2Original Poster11 points · 7 months agoDefinitely I agree!
 I’m just fortunate that we can live off of my fiancé’s income and still be okay!
 But yes...
 If we don’t reopen soon I have a feeling this is what’s gonna happen too!level 25 points · 7 months agoI agree too, I’ve been worried about this since the services were suspended.
 Right now, ULTA is putting more money into us so I think on the 18th, if anything they may just switch it back to the flat 15/30 for all.
 Also, with all the backlash Sephora is getting there is NO way ULTA wants to go down that road and Mary and Kecia seem like they have our backs instead of treating us like just a number.
 Idk, maybe I’m just being optimistic but don’t stress over it as of now because stress lowers your immune system that is critical to have right now.
 Good luck and stay safe.level 26 points · 7 months agoI hope they keep us on, but my real hope is to go to work again, which means this virus needs to go away.

 If they are laying off, it's not a bad thing.
 It allows the staff to apply for unemployment.
 Plus the videochat is probably the best way to do it.

 I don't work there so I'm not sure of everything going.level 218 points · 7 months agowe shouldn’t be praising a multibillion dollar company for shifting the responsibility of caring for their employees to the tax payers.

 Layoffs seem inevitable but stores will reopen at some point and they will need employees again, preferably ones already trained with ulta.
