 2  AL-QA™IDA 
 The attacks of 9/11 are the only successful terror
ist attacks by al-Qa™ida against the US homeland. 
 Prior to 9/11, al-Qa™ida had successfully launched only three other terrorist attacks globallyŠhaving attacked 
the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and th
e USS Cole in the Port of Aden in Yemen in 2000. 
 Al-Qa™ida™s activity is uniquely international, includin
g attacks in 21 different countries, more than any other 
terrorist organization active since 1970
. It is also especially lethal, bearing responsibility for less than 0.5% 
of terrorist attacks since 1998, but more than 5% of fatalities. 
 US TERRORISM SINCE 9/11 
FREQUENCY OF ATTACKS 
 The frequency of terrorist attacks in the United 
States has decreased since 2001. 
 From 1991-2000, the United States averaged 
41.3 terrorist attacks per year.
1 After 2001, the 
average number of US attacks decreased to 16 

per year from 2002-2010.  
 From 1991-2000, the United States ranked 
20th globally in terms of number of terrorist 
attacks. The United States dropped to 21
st for the period 2002-2010. 
 Four terrorist attacks occurred in the United 
States in 2006. This was the smallest number 

of annual attacks in the country since the 

Global Terrorism Database began tracking 
incidents in 1970. 
US TERRORISM DEATHS 
 The average number of US terrorism fatalities per 
year has decreased since 2001.  
 In the years prior to 2001, the average number of 
fatalities per terrorist attack in the United States was 

0.42. This includes the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City 

which killed 168.  Following 2001, this rate decreased to 

0.24 deaths per US terrorist attack. 
 From 2003-2007, there were no fatalities from 
terrorist activity in the United States. 
 Since 2008, seven of 42 US
 terrorist incidents have 
involved a fatality, with 22 deaths during this period 
(including 13 at Ft. Hood in 2009.) 
                                                            1Unfortunately, GTD does not include data on
 terrorist activity in 1993. For an explanat

 3   NATURE OF US TERRORIST ACTIVITY 
 Terrorists launched attacks in 44 states, as well as 
Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, between 1991 and 
2000, while 30 states and Washington, D.C., experienced terrorist attacks after 2001. 
 The concentration of terrorist activity shifted among 
states in the pre- and post-9/11 eras. California 
experienced the highest percentage of terrorist attack
s for both periods, but the percent of attacks in 
California increased from 15% to 24% in the post-2001 period. The post-2001 period also saw increased 
activity levels in Washington State and Michigan. Concentration of Terrorist Activity at the State Level

  Terrorists™ weapons of choice within the United Stat
es remained incendiary devices (used in 51% of pre-
2001 cases and 56% of post-2001 cases) and explosives (27% and 28%, respectively). In the post-9/11 era, 

though, terrorists in the United States were far less likely to use firearms in attacks than they had been in 

the pre-9/11 era, with the rate of terrorist fire
arm usage decreasing from 18% to 6% post-9/11.

 4    Between 1991 and 2010 17 different 
terrorist groups carried out attacks in the United 

States representing a diverse array of ideologies. 

Far-right, ethno-nationalist, and single issue 

groups each account for roughly one-quarter of the 

groups. Eighteen percent were religious and 6% 

were far-left. 
 Of the three religious terrorist groups 
targeting the United States from 1991 to 2010, al-

Qa™ida was the only attacking group that was 

successful. Al-Qa™ida in the Arabian Peninsula 

(AQAP) and Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) each 

made unsuccessful attempts in 2009 and 2010, 
respectively. 
 GLOBAL TERRORISM SINCE 9/11 
FREQUENCY OF ATTACKS WORLDWIDE 
 Whereas the frequency of terrorist attacks in the 
United States has dropped steadily in the post-9/11 
era, globally there has been an increase in terrorist 

activity since 2004. 
 From 1991 to 2001, there was an average of 
2922 terrorist attacks around the world each year, 
while the average number of attacks since 2001 has 

been 2826 per year. In just the last 5 years, though 

(2006-2010), the average number of attacks per 

year rose to 3994. 
 The total number of attacks in 2010 (4669 
incidents) was almost equal to the total number of 

attacks in 1991 (4680). 
 The number of countries attacked by terrorists in th
e periods before and after 9/11 remained the same, with 
150 countries experiencing a terrorist attack from 
1991-2000 and from 2002-2010. However, the countries 
that experienced the most terrorist activity shifted pre- and post-9/11.

 5   Iraq was the site of more than 6300 attacks since 2002 and there were substantial increases in Afghanistan 
and Thailand as well, while the relative levels of ac
tivity in South American countries (Colombia and Peru) 
reduced after 2001. India and Pakistan remained the sites of high levels of terrorism both pre- and post-
9/11. 
TERRORISM DEATHS WORLDWIDE 
 Globally, over 65000 people have died in terrorist attacks since 2001, with an average of 7258 deaths in 
terrorist attacks per year. This annual average has increased since the 1991-2000 period, during which 

there were more than 61000 terrorist fatalities around the world, averaging 6825 deaths per year 

    Prior to 9/11 the total number of deaths per year 
declined gradually. In the absence of 9/11 terrorism 
fatalities, 2001 would have been the lowest since the 1970s. Since then, the annual rate of fatalities 
increased steadily through 2007 and has recently been declining once again. 
 Mass-casualty attacks that cause more than 25 fatali
ties follow a pattern similar to that of terrorism 
generally during the 1991-2010 time period.

 6   Mass-casualty terrorism has become more concentrated, post-2001. From 1991-2000, 51 countries 
experience at least one mass-casualty terrorist attack. This number decreased to 34 countries from 2002-
2010, with Iraq the location of 46.7% of th
e 394 post-2001 mass-casualty terror attacks. 
AL-QA™IDA-AFFILIATED TERRORISM GLOBALLY 
 Al-Qa™ida-affiliated and -inspired terrorists have proliferated since 9/11. The deadliest post-9/11 US terrorist 
incident has been the 2009 attack on Fort Hood (Texas
) which left 13 people dead following a rampage by 
Nidal HasanŠan individual who had been in contact 
with Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical Muslim cleric and 
purported operational commander of al-Qa™ida in the Arabian Peninsula.  
 Groups allied with al-Qa™ida are respon
sible for over 12000 deaths worldwide.
