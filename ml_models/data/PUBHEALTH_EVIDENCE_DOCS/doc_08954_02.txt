   INTRODUCTION
  The vast majority of midwives in the United States 
(U.S.) 
are 
certified 
nurse
-midwives (CNMs) and 
certif
ied 
midwives (CMs).
 CNMs are licensed and have prescriptive authority in every state. CMs are 
licensed in five states. 
 According to the American Midwifery Certification Board, 
as of January 2012 
there are 1
2,622 CNMs and 
 73 CMs
 in the United States
 (D. S
mith, personal
 communication, January, 
2012), and
 since 1991, the number of midwife
-attended births in the United States has 
more than
 doubled
.1,2
  This growth of midwifery
 has been supported by published research 
that
 demonstrates 
midwifery care is associ
ated with
  high
-quality 
and
 is 
comparable or
 in some studies,
 better outcomes 
than
 care provided by
 obstetrician/gynecologists
. Recipients
 of care 
by midwives 
report
 high levels of 
patient satisfaction, and 
midwifery care 
results in 
lower costs due to fewe
r unnecessary, invasive, and 
expensive interventions.
 
 
This document 
provides
 an overview of research and statistics that describe
 the practice of midwives 
represented by 
the American College of Nurse
-Midwives (
ACNM
) in the 
United States.
         Midwifery
 as practiced by CNMs and CMs encompasses a full range of primary healthcare 
services for women from adolescence to beyond menopause. These services include primary 
care, gynecologic and family planning services, preconception
 care, care during pregnancy, 
childbirth, and the postpartum period, care of the normal newborn during the first 28 days of 

life, and treatment of male partners for sexually transmitted infections.
 These services are 
provided in diverse settings such as am
bulatory care clinics, private offices, community and 
public health systems, homes, hospitals, and birth centers.  CNMs and CMs practice in accord 

with the Standards for the Practice of Midwifery, as defined by the ACNM. These standards 

meet or exceed the 
global competencies and standards for the practice of midwifery as defined 
by the International Confederation of Midwives.
 Certified nurse
-midwives
 (CNMs)
 are registered nurses who have graduated from a nurse
-midwifery education program accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Midwifery 
Education (ACME)
 and have passed a national certification examination to receive the 
professional designation of cer
tified nurse
-midwife. Nurse
-midwives have been practicing in the 
United States
 since the 1920s.
  Certified midwives
 (CMs) are educated in the discipline of midwifery. They earn graduate 
degrees, meet health and science education requirements, complete a mi
dwifery education 
program accredited by ACME, and pass the same national certification examination as CNMs to 
receive the professional designation of CM. Graduates of an ACME
-accredited midwifery 
education program must pass a national certification examina
tion administered by the American 

Midwifery Certification Board (AMCB) to receive the professional designation of CNM or CM. 

To maintain the designation of CNM or CM, midwives must be recertified every 5 years 
through AMCB and meet specific continuing educ
ation requirements.

     JOINT STATEMENT OF PRACTICE RELATIONS BETWEEN OBSTETRICIAN
-GYNECOLOGISTS 
AND CERTIFIED
 NURSE
-MIDWIVES/CERTIFIED MIDWIVES
 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (the College) and the American College of 
Nurse
-Midwives (ACNM) affirm 
our shared goal of safe women™s health care in the United States 
through the promotion of evidence
-based models provided by obstetrician
Œgynecologists (ob
-gyns), 
certified nurse
-midwives (CNMs), and certified midwives (CMs). The College and ACNM believe 
health care is most effective when it occurs in a system that facilitates communication across care 
settings and among providers. Ob
-gyns and CNMs/CMs are experts in their respective fields of practice 
and are educated, trained, and licensed, independent pro
viders who may collaborate with each other 
based on the needs of their patients. Quality of care is enhanced by collegial relationships characterized 
by mutual respect and trust as well as professional responsibility and accountability.
  Recognizing the hi
gh level of responsibility that ob
-gyns and CNMs/CMs assume when providing care 
to women, the College and ACNM affirm their commitment to promote the highest standards for 

education, national professional certification, and recertification of their respect
ive members and to 
support evidence
-based practice. Accredited education and professional certification preceding 
licensure are essential to ensure skilled providers at all levels of care across the United States.
  The College and ACNM recognize the import
ance of options and preferences of women in their health 
care. Ob
-gyns and CNMs/CMs work in a variety of settings, including private practice, community 
health facilities, clinics, hospitals, and accredited birth centers. The College and ACNM hold differen
t positions on home birth. Establishing and sustaining viable practices that can provide broad services to 
women requires that ob
-gyns and CNM/CMs have access to affordable professional liability insurance 
coverage, hospital privileges, equivalent reimburs
ement from private payers and under government 
programs, and support services including, but not limited to laboratory, obstetric imaging, and 
anesthesia. To provide highest quality and seamless care, ob
-gyns and CNMs/CMs should have access 
to a system of 
care that fosters collaboration among licensed, independent providers.

   MORE WOMEN ARE CHOOSI
NG MIDWIFERY CARE
  CNMs and CMs attended 313,516 births in 2009, according to the National Center for Health 

Statistics. This represents 11.3% of all vaginal births, or 7.6% of all US births
.1   The proportion of CNM/CM
-attended births has risen nearly every year since 1989
, the first year 
that CNM/CM statistics were made available
.1   HIGH QUALITY CARE AN
D EXCELLENT OUTCOMES
  Decades of research indicate that primary care services provided by 
advanced practice nurses a
nd nurse
-midwives
 compare favorably to those 
provided by
 physicians. 
 In a
 recent systematic review of studies 
comparing midwifery care to physician care
, researchers
 examined multiple outcomes. Results indicate
d that 
women cared for by CNMs compared to 
women of the same risk status care
d for by physicians 
had   Lower rates of cesarean 
birth,
   Lower rates of labor induction and augmentation
,   Significant reduction in the incidence of third and fourth degree perineal tears
,  Lower use of regional anesthesia
, and   Higher rates of breastfeeding
.3  In a
 review of maternity care processes 
of CNMs and physicians
, the authors
 concluded that care 
processes are heavily influenced by the provider group.
3 Women in the CNM group were more likely to 
receive
   Prenatal educa
tion focusing on health promotion risk reduction behaviors
,  A more hands on approach with a closer supportive relationship with their provider 

during labor and birth
, and
  Fewer technological and invasive interventions.
4   Researchers conducted a 
rigorous s
ystematic review comparing midwife
-led models of care and 
physician
-led models of care 
and
 concluded that midwife
-led care has benefit over other models of care 
for women of similar risk status. Women in the midwife
-led models had
   A significantly higher c
hance for a normal vaginal birth, fewer interventions
, and 
successful
 initiation of
 breastfeeding
,  Care during labor provided by a midwife th
at the woman
 knew
, and
   Increased sense of control during the labor and birth experience

   CenteringPregnancy® is a
 midwifery
-based, woman
-centered model 
that
 incorporates risk assessment, 
support, and education into a unified program of group prenatal care. A 
randomized clinical trial 
was 
conducted at two university
-affiliated prenatal clinics 
to compare 
select outcom
es in women receiving 
care in a CenteringPregnancy® group and women receiving traditional prenatal care.  Results indicate
d that women receiving 
CenteringPregnancy®
 group care experienced
 a 33% reduction in the risk for 
preterm birth and
 had
 significantly
    Higher rates of breastfeeding
,   Higher readiness for labor and birth
,   Better prenatal knowledge
, and

.7  MIDWIVES PROVIDE PRI
MARY CARE
  Primary care is the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are 
accountable for addressing the majority of health care needs,
 developing a sustained partnership with 
patients, practicing within the context of family and community (ACNM Core Competencies). Certified 
nurse midwives are recognized as primary care providers under current federal law.

8     FEWER CESAREAN
S WITH MIDWIVES
   Between 1970 and 2009, the 
cesarean rate in the United States increased d
ramatically from 5% to 33%.
1                                                    Today, approximately one in three women 
gives birth
 by 
cesarean. 
To date, no published research
 demonstrates 
that 
significant maternal or child health indicators have improved in the wake of the 

increased 
cesarean rate. 
  Midwifery
 care results in fewer 
cesarean 
births

 physician car
e for equally low

The
 US Department of Health and Human Services and other government agencies have come to a 
consensus that the primary 
cesarean 
birth
 rate must be reduced
:   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention™s National Center for Health Statistics
, the state of New Mexico, where CNM
s attend one
-third of all births, has the lowest 
cesarean rate of 
all 5
0 states
.1  The 2011 Systematic Review of Advanced Practices Nurse Outcomes
 included
 15 studies comparing 
cesarean rates of women care
d for by physicians
 and by CNMs. The findings demonstrate
d significantly
  lower 
cesarean
 rates 
for women cared for by CNMs
 than for
 women care
d for by 
physicians in comparable populations.
3  Women who received care 
in 
a collaborative practice of CNMs and obstetricians with th
e option of 
giving birth 
at a freestanding birth center were more likely to have a normal spontaneous vaginal 
birth. Specifically, the data in this study demonstrated that 80.9% of 
the women
 in the collaborative 
practice group gave birth vaginally, versus 
62.8% in an all
-physician practice.
9   CNMs/CMs are the predominant care providers within birth centers in the United States. Preliminary 

data from the American Association of Birth Centers online data registry 2007
-2010 for 15,661 
women who presented to 76
 different birth centers in labor demonstrate excellent outcomes (S. 
Stapleton, personal communication, November 7, 2011). 
  Findings related to women and infants 
transferred to the hospital in labor or after birth include the following:
   No maternal morta
lity,
  Combined intrapartum and neonatal mortality is 1.6 births/1000 
(this compares favorably 
to the national neonatal mortality rate alone which is 6.1/1000 births
),10 and
  Cesarean  rate of 6.1% (national cesarean  rate 33%).

LEADERS IN HE
ALTH CARE REFORM 
  A multi
-disciplinary workgroup from public health, medicine, midwifery
, and government developed a 
‚‚Blueprint for Action: Steps Toward a High Quality, High Value Maternity Care System
,™™ in order
 to 
provide a working plan to improve ma

States
. The
 workgroup
 recommended 
that health care organizations
, ﬁimplement policies and practices that foster safe physiologic childbirth 
and decrease excessive use of elective procedures and interventions.ﬂ

USE OF 
              
UNNECESSARY PROCEDUR
ES  While all standard medical and obstetric procedures are a
vailable
 to CNM/CM clients, their application 
is based on the condition of the woman and her 
fetus
/newborn
. CNM
s/CMs provide intermittent fe
tal 
monitoring for 
women who are 
low risk allowing 
them 
greater mobility and comfort. This care is less 
invasive, less expensive, and less likely to result in misdiagnosis and the use of unnecessary 

interventions
, including unnecessary cesareans
.   In a
 2011 study evaluating maternal and neonatal outcomes
, researchers
 documented that women 
receiving care in a ﬁhigh
-touch, low
-techﬂ collaborative CNM practice had
   Lower than 
the 
national average rate of 
cesarean

 and

FERY CARE
 REDUCES
 HEALTH CARE COSTS
  The total amount spent on health care in the U
nited 
States
 is greater than in any other country in the 
world.
13 Hospitalization related to p
regnancy and childbirth costs approximately $86 billion 
per
 year
, which represents
 the highest hospitalization costs 
for
 any health condition.
14 Unfortunately, t
his high 
cost has not translated into quality care. Even though 
the United States 
spend
s more p
er capita on 
childbirth care, 
it ranks a low 41
st in maternal deaths
 among industrialized and developing 
countries
.15Unnecessary 
interventions during 
pregnancy and birth 
burden
 women emotionally and 
physically 
and
 is costly to 
the entire health care system
. Midwifery care lowers healthcare costs in part 
by appropriate use of expensive t
echnology and reducing cesarean
 rate
s.   The a
verage cost
s for vaginal birth are approximately 50% lower than 
those
 for 
cesarean
 birth.
14    The Office of Technology Assessment
 analyzed 
nurse 
practitioner and 
nurse
-midwife 
practice at two different points in time and found that they provided medical care that 
was equivalent to or exceeded physician care
 at a lower total cost.

S ACCESS TO CARE
  Women
 with less access to resources
, particularly thos

 can face considerable obstacles in 
obtaining maternal health care
 Pregnant women 
in rural areas 
are more likely to receive delayed or no 
prenatal care and to receive less adequate care when
 it is available, factors that contribute to higher 
infant mortality.
  Reducing costs and increasing access to care are key government goals for reforming the US 
health care system.

     Since the 1920s with the initiation of the Frontier Nursing Service nurse
-midwifery model of care, 
nurse
-midwives have been providing care in underserved areas.
18
   The number of family 
medicine physicians and 
ob-gyns delivering 
infants
 in rural areas continues to 
decline.
19,20
   CNMs provided care to more women on Medicaid living in rural areas of California and
 Washington 
than obstetricians.
21  According to a 
report published by the 
Insti
tute of Medicine
 (IOM) in 2010
, nurse

WHEN THEY RECEIVE 
MIDWIFERY
 CARE
   ﬁMy midwife appointments were an ho
ur long, and we felt our midwives really cared about us
 and 
not just about the physical aspects of the pregnancy, but the emotional as well. They didn't just help 
me birth a baby
; they helped us become a family.
ﬂ   ﬁI am so thankful that we have a wonderful
 midwifery practice in my city that delivers in a great 
progressive hospital. My midwife was so calm and treated my labor as something normal and not 

scary. Not surprisingly, I didn't feel afraid after that! I saw her confidence in me and my ability to 

giv
e birth. We were so pleased with our experience that we cannot imagine going to anyone but a 
midwife for our next child.

     ﬁWhen I became pregnant with my first child, my sister
-in-law, an 
ob-gyn
, suggested that I see a 
midwife. She so overwhelmingly prais
ed the midwives in her practice that it seemed like the natural 
choice for us. My midwife approached pregnancy as a normal process and conveyed a sense of calm 

empowerment to me throughout. I am certain that her patience and wisdom saved us from needing 

undesired interventions and helped us have the birth experience that was important to us. She will 

always have a special place in our lives and hearts.ﬂ 
 
  ﬁWithin a matter of weeks after finding out I was pregnant, I chose to see a group of certified nurse
-midwives who attended births at a freestanding birth center as well as a nearby hospital. I am so 
grateful that I had a full spectrum of choices for navigating labor and birth and a care provider I 

could trust to guide me through the difficult patches witho
ut abandoning my values and wishes. I™ll 

continue visiting my midwife for my gynecologic care and without a doubt will return for my next 

birth.
ﬂ   ﬁTo say that I love my midwife is nothing short of an understatement. She unselfishly gave me the 
support and
 encouragement that I needed to confidently obtain a wonderful natural healthy birth for 

my daughter. After having been through a very difficult birth experience with my first child as a 

direct consequence of multiple unnecessary medical interventions, I k
new that there had to be a 

better way to experience birth.
 She helped me see it through to the very end; through every tear and 
drop of sweat she stood with me, all the while saying
, ‚ﬁYou can do this!
