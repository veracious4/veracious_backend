 Effective for flights taking off at 11:59 PM EDT on Friday, March 13th, Americans returning from all restricted countries will now be required to travel through the following 13 airports: Boston-Logan International Airport (BOS), Massachusetts Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD), Illinois Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Texas Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW), Michigan Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Hawaii Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), Georgia John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York Los Angeles International Airport, (LAX), California Miami International Airport (MIA), Florida Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), New Jersey San Francisco International Airport (SFO), California Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA), Washington Washington-Dulles International Airport (IAD), Virginia  Upon arrival, travelers will proceed to standard customs processing.
 They will then continue to enhanced entry screening where the passenger will be asked about their medical history, current condition, and asked for contact information for local health authorities.
 Passengers will then be given written guidance about COVID-19 and directed to proceed to their final destination, and immediately home-quarantine in accordance with CDC best practices.
 Fact Sheet: DHS Notice of Arrival Restrictions on China, Iran and Schengen Countries of Europe “While the overall risk of serious infection from the coronavirus to the general public remains low at this time, the Trump administration is taking these aggressive measures to keep the risk low, requiring all Americans returning from affected areas in Europe to be funneled through 13 airports for screening upon their return to the U.S.,” said Acting Secretary Wolf.
 “To minimize disruptions to travelers, TSA, CBP, and air carriers are working to identify qualifying passengers before their scheduled flights.
 These passengers will be rerouted to one of the 13 airports by their airline at no cost to them.” Wolf continued: “I understand this new process will be disruptive to some travelers, however this action is needed to protect the general public from further exposure and spread of the coronavirus.
 Once back in the U.S. it is imperative that individuals honor self-quarantine directives to help protect their loved-ones and communities.” President Trump determined that the potential for widespread transmission of the coronavirus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States threatens the security of the homeland.
 Therefore, the Department is taking action in furtherance of the public health interests advanced by the March 11thpresidential proclamation which suspends entry to nearly all foreign nationals who have been in certain European countries, China and Iran at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled travel to the U.S.
 These European countries, known as the Schengen Area, include: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.
 This Presidential Proclamation does not apply to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, nor their family members under the age of 21, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation.
 Nor does it apply to cargo and economic shipping.
