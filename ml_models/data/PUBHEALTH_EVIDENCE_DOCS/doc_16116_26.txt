 v    ABSTRACT: THE CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT (CSA) STUDY  
Sexual assault is a public health and public safety problem with far-reaching implications. 
Although a substantial body of 
research on sexual assault exis
ts, additional data are needed 
to help document the current magnitude of the problem, the extent to which certain 
subpopulations are impacted, the consequences and reporting (or nonreporting) of 

victimization incidents, and stra
tegies for preventing and reducing the risk of sexual assault 
and effectively responding to victims.  
One subpopulation that is often believed to be at elevated risk for sexual assault is college 
students. RTI International (RTI) was funded by
 the National Institut
e of Justice (NIJ) to 
conduct the Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study, 
which is a study of various types of sexual 
assault experienced by universit
y students. This study has one primary research objective. 
1. To examine the prevalence, nature, and repo
rting of various types of sexual assault 
experienced by university students in an
 effort to inform the development of 
targeted intervention strategies. In addition, the CSA Study has two service-or
iented objectives, the success towards which 
were not measured and are thus not the subjec
t of this final report. These objectives are, 
however, worth mentioning. 
2. To educate students about various types of
 sexual assault, how they can maximize 
their safety, and what they can do if 
they or someone they know has been 
victimized. 
3. To provide students with information ab
out the campus and community resources 
that are available should they
 need assistance or have 
any concerns or questions. 
RTI has been working with two large, public universities on the CSA Study. Data were 

collected using a Web-based survey from ov
er 6,800 undergraduate students (5,466 women 
and 1,375 men). Data indicate that 13.7% of undergraduate women had been victims of at 
least one completed sexual assault since entering college: 4.7% were victims of physically 
forced sexual assault; 7.8%
 of women were sexually 
assaulted when they were 
incapacitated after voluntarily consuming drugs 
and/or alcohol (i.e., th
ey were victims of 
alcohol and/or other drug- [AOD] enabled sexu
al assault); 0.6% were
 sexually assaulted when they were incapacitated after having b
een given a drug withou
t their knowledge (i.e., 
they were certain they had been victims of drug-facilitated sexual assault [DFSA]). Detailed 

data were collected on the context, reporting,
 and consequences of sexual assault. Self-
reported rates of sexual assault victimization and perpetration among males were very low. 
The primary implications of the CSA Study are the relative rarity of cases of DFSA and the 

need to incorporate alcohol and drug message
s into sexual assault 
prevention and risk reduction programming.  
vii   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 Sexual assault is a public health and public safety problem with far-reaching implications. 
Being a victim of sexual assault is one of the most violating 
experiences anyone can endure 
and can cause immediate, as well as long-term,
 physical and mental health consequences. 
Of rape victims, 25% to 45% suffer from nongenital trauma; 19% to 22% suffer from 
genital trauma; up to 40% get sexually tr
ansmitted diseases (S
TDs); and 1% to 5% 
become pregnant, resulting in an estimated 32,000 rape-related
 pregnancies in the United 
States annually (Holmes, Resnick, Kirkpatrick, & Best, 1996). Four out of five rape victims 
subsequently suffer from chronic physical or 
psychological conditions (Strategies for the 
Treatment and Prevention of 
Sexual Assault, 1995), and rape
 victims are 13 times more likely to attempt suicide than noncrime victims and six times more likely than victims of 
other crimes (Rape in America: A Report to the Nation, 1992). Overall, rape is believed to 
carry the highest annual victim cost of any crime. The annual 
victim costs are $127 billion 
(excluding child sex abuse cases), followed 
by assault at $93 billion per year, murder 
(excluding arson and drunk driving) at $61 b
illion per year, and child abuse at $56 billion 
per year (Miller, Co
hen, & Wierama, 1996). Given the substantial impact sexual victimization has on individual victims and society, 
collecting information that advances our understanding of sexual assault and helps us 
prevent victimization and better meet the needs 
of victims is critical.  Much research has 
been published about the sexual assault experiences of co
llege women, a group often 
characterized as being at high 
risk for sexual victi
mization. Researchers have consistently 
reported that a sizable percentage of women 
are sexually assaulted during their college years, with, on average, at least 50% of their 
sexual assaults involving the use of alcohol or 
other drugs by the perpetrator, victim, or bo
th (Abbey, 2002; Fisher et al., 2000; Testa & 
Parks, 1996). 
RTI International was funded by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to conduct the 
Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study. The CSA Study was undertaken specifically to 

document the prevalence of distinct types of sexual assault among university women (with 
ﬁtypesﬂ defined by how the assault was achiev
ed, such as the use of physical force or 
incapacitation of the victim due to drugs or al
cohol), as well as the context, consequences, 
and reporting of distinct types of sexual assault among a la
rge sample of undergraduate 
women from two large universities. In the CSA 
Study, sexual assault 
includes a wide range 
viii  Section 1 Š Introduction of victimizations, including rape and other ty
pes of unwanted sexual
 contact (e.g., sexual 
battery).  
The typology that guides the classification of
 sexual assault in the CSA Study is based on 
how the assault (or attempted assault) was achi
eved. Virtually all sexu
al assault research 
distinguishes between assaults
 occurring as a result of 
physical force 
(or threats of physical 
force) from assaults that do not involve the us
e or threat of force; the CSA Study similarly 
considers physically forced sexual assault as 
a distinct category of assault. Another means 
through which sexual assault is achieved is 
incapacitation of the victim
. Legal definitions of sexual assault factor in one™s ability to provide consent, and individuals who are 
incapacitated because of the effects of alcohol 
or drugs (or otherwise incapacitated, such as 
when they are unconscious or asleep) are inca
pable of consenting. In the CSA Study, we 
consider as incapacitated sexual assault
 any unwanted sexual contact occurring when a 
victim is unable to provide consent or stop 
what is happening because she is passed out, 
drugged, drunk, incapa
citated, or asleep, regardless 
of whether the perpetrator was 
responsible for her substance 
use or whether substances we
re administered without her 
knowledge. We break down incapa
citated sexual assault into four subtypes. The first two 
subtypes pertain to sexual 
assaults achieved when the 
victim is givenŠwithout her 
knowledge or consentŠa substance that ph
ysically incapacitates her and makes her 
incapable of providing consent. 
DFSA
 (drug-facilitated sexual assault) is defined as 
unwanted sexual contact occurring when the victim is incapacitated and unable to provide 
consent after she had been given a drug without her knowledge or consent. Incidents 
classified as DFSA are thos
e in which the victim is 
certain that she had been drugged. In 
contrast, SDFSA 
(suspected drug-facilitated sexual assault) is defined 
as incapacitated 
sexual assault occurri
ng after the victim 
suspects
 that she had been given a drug without 
her knowledge or consent. The third type of in
capacitated sexual assa
ult considered in the CSA Study is termed 
alcohol and/or other drug- (AOD-) enabled sexual assault. 
This 
subtype includes unwanted sexual contact occu
rring when the victim is incapacitated and 
unable to provide consent because of voluntary consumption of alcohol or other drugs.  
Finally, to distinguish between incapacitation due to the effects of AOD (administered either 

coercively or voluntarily) and other types of 
incapacitation, we include a fourth type of 
incapacitated sexual assault in our typology. 
Other incapacitated sexual assaults 
capture the remaining, and likely uncommon, situations in which a victim can be incapacitated, such as 

by being asleep or unconscious. 
ix  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
The CSA Study builds upon previous research 
and makes a number of contributions to the 
field. The CSA Study is one of the first to ge
nerate estimates of th
e prevalence of drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) among a college sample. The concept of DFSA has received 
widespread attention from the media and a va
riety of stakeholders, including prevention 
and risk reduction specialists, treatment 
providers, law enforcement, and university 
administrators, but empirical da
ta on the prevalence and natu
re of this phenomenon have 
yet to appear in the literature. In addition, th
e CSA study explores the extent to which risk 
factors vary by type of assault.  We believe th
is is the first study to find that the type of 
sexual assault a woman has experi
enced in the past puts her at risk for experiencing that 
same type, but not another type, of sexual assault in the future. A finding like this may help 
prevention and service provider
s tailor their efforts and take into account what type of 
sexual assault a woman has experienced 
or may be at risk of experiencing. 
METHODS The CSA Study involved conducting a We
b-based survey of random samples of 
undergraduate students at two large public univ
ersities, one located in the South (University 
1) and one located in the Midwest (University 
2). The CSA Survey was 
administered in the Winter of 2006, and a total of 5,446 unde
rgraduate women and 1,375 undergraduate men 
participated. Because the male
 component of the study was 
exploratory, the data and results presented in this summary represent women only.  The CSA Study was reviewed 
and approved by RTI™s Institutional Review Board (IRB), as well as the university IRBs.  
We drew random samples of students aged 18-
25 and enrolled at least three-quarters™ time 
at each university to participate in the CSA Study.  Sampled students were sent an initial 

recruitment e-mail that described the study, provided a unique CSA Study ID#, and 

included a hyperlink to the CSA Study Web si
te. During each of 
the following weeks, students who had not completed the survey were sent follow-up e-mails and a hard-copy 

letter encouraging them to partic
ipate. The overall response rates for survey completion for 
the undergraduate women sampled at the 
two universities were 42.2% and 42.8%, 
respectively.  
A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted 
to create sample weights. We compared 
respondents and nonrespondents on the admini
strative data elements provided by the universities, which included age, university, race
/ethnicity, and year of study. Although little 
nonresponse bias was detected, weights adjust
ing for non-response were developed using a 
Generalized Exponential Model (Folsom & Sing
h, 2000) to reduce nonresponse bias and 
x  Section 1 Š Introduction increase sample representative
ness. Cohen™s effect size was used as a measure of the 
magnitude of the bias, and weights were added 
for university, gender, year of study, and 
race/ethnicity, which reduced the bias to negligible levels (Cohen, 1988). All prevalence 
estimates and multivariate models were computed using weighted data.  
The survey was administered an
onymously (students did not enter their CSA Study ID # to 
take the survey) and was designed to be co
mpleted in an averag
e of 15 minutes.  The 
survey was divided into six modules.  
Background Information
 which
 included survey items on demographics, school cl
assification (year of study, year of enrollment, transfer 
status), residential characte
ristics, academic performance, and school involvement.  
Alcohol and Other Drug Use
 generated a number of measures of alcohol and drug use, 
and related substance use behaviors.  
Dating
 included items on sexual orientation, dating, 
consensual sexual 
activity, and dating violence.  The 
Experiences 
module was developed 
after extensive reviews of past surveys of sexual assault
1 and generated information on 
physically forced sexual assaul
t and incapacitated sexual assa
ult. Sexual assault included 
forced touching of a sexual nature, oral sex, 
sexual intercourse, anal sex, and/or sexual 
penetration with a finger or object  For both
 physically forced and incapacitated sexual 
assault, information was collected on 
completed 
and attempted 
assaults experienced 
before 
entering college and since entering college
.  For completed sexual 
assaults, a series of follow-up questions enabled us to define the a
ssault as sexual battery
 (i.e., sexual assault 
that entailed sexual touching only) and/or ra
pe (i.e., sexual assaul
t that entailed oral, 
vaginal, or anal penetration).  For male respondents, a 
Behaviors
 module asking about the perpetration of the same types of sexual as
sault covered in the Experiences module was 
included.  The final module 
of the survey covered atti
tudes about sexual assault 
(respondents were given seven scenarios and as
ked to classify them 
as rape) and attitudes 
about the survey (the degree of honesty th
ey employed when answering the survey questions).  After the last survey question was answered, respon
dents were presented with an 
informational module on sexual assault (e.g., se
xual assault definition
s, prevention advice, 
legal consequences of giving someone a drug 
without their knowledge 
or consent, signs of 
drug ingestion, and links and telephone numbers to local, state, and national resources for 

sexual assault victims). In a
ddition, respondents were provid
ed with a survey completion 
                                         
 1Previous studies reviewed included, but were no
t limited to, the National College Women Survey 
(Koss et al. 1987), the College Alcohol Study (Mohler-Kuo et al., 2004), the National Violence 
Against Women Survey (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2000), and the National College Women Sexual 
Victimization Survey (Fisher et al. 2000).

RESULTS 
We used a variety of descriptive, bivariate, an
d multivariate techniques to analyze the CSA 
data.  Essentially, these analyses helped us 1)
 generate prevalence 
estimates of different 
types of sexual assault, 2) iden
tify factors associated with be
ing a victim of different types 
of sexual assault, and 3) describe the contex
ts, consequences, and reporting of different 
types of sexual assault.    
The majority (66.9%) of the un
dergraduate women who participated in the CSA Study were 
white, although a sizeable prop
ortion of them were black (16.2%) or in the ﬁotherﬂ category 
(14.0%) which includes Asians
, Native Hawaiians/Other Pa
cific Islanders, American Indians/Alaska Natives and respondents of multiple races.  Only 3.0% of the sample was 
Hispanic.  The majority of the sample was 18 to
 20 years of age (63%).  There were larger 
percentages of freshman (29.9%) and seni
ors (26.6%) than sophomores (22.8%) and 
juniors (20.7%) in the sample.  This distri
bution reflected the 
distribution at the participating universities since the data were weighted for year of study.   
Prevalence Estimates of Sexual Assau
lt Before and Since Entering College  
Of the 5,446 women, 28.5% reported having
 experienced an attempted or completed 
sexual assault either before or
 since entering college.  Figu
re 1 presents the estimates for 
the various types of sexual 
assault experienced by the wo
men.  Nearly 16% of the 5,446 
women experienced attempted or completed sexual assault 
before entering college
 (box 1).  
Almost equal percentages experienced attempted sexual assault before college (10.1%, box 
2) and completed sexual assaul
t before college (11.3%, box 3).  Of course, some women 
(5.5%) experienced both attempted and comple
ted sexual assault before entering college (i.e., the women represented in box 2 and bo
x 3 are not mutually exclusive).  Similar 
percentages of women experienced completed ph
ysically forced assault (6.4%, box 4) and 
incapacitated sexual assa
ult (7.0%, box 5) before entering 
college.  Note that 2.1% of the 
study women experienced both ph
ysically forced and incapaci
tated sexual assault before 
entering college (i.e., the women represented in box 4 and box 5 are not mutually 
exclusive).   
xii  Section 1 Š Introduction Nineteen percent of the women reported experiencing completed or attempted sexual 
assault since entering college (box 6), a slightly larger perc
entage than thos
e experiencing such incidents before en
tering college (box 1).  Since ente
ring college, slightly more women 
experienced completed sexual 
assault (13.7%, box 8) than attempted sexual assault 
(12.6%, box 7), with 7.2% of the women expe
riencing both completed sexual assault and 
attempted sexual assault during college (i.e
., the women represented in box 7 and box 8 
are not mutually exclusive).   
Figure 1. The Prevalence of Different Types 
of Sexual Assault Before and Since Entering 
College (Unweighted Frequencie
s, Weighted Percentages) 
   Nearly 5% of the total sample was forcibly sexually assaulted since college entry (4.7%, box 
9).  More than three percent of the women (3
.4%) experienced forced
 rape since entering 
college (box 11) and 1.4% experienced forced sexual battery since entering college (box 10). Approximately 11% of the women experience
d sexual assault while incapacitated since 
entering college (box 12), with 
a higher percentage of women 
being victims of incapacitated 
rape than incapacitated sexual
 battery since entering college
 (8.5%, box 14 compared to 
2.6%, box 13, respectively).  It is important 
to note that AOD-enab
led sexual assault was xiii  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
experienced by 7.8% of the wo
men since entering college (box 15).  In contrast, smaller 
percentages of women experienced drug-facilitated sexual assault that they were certain 
happened (0.6%, box 16), that they suspecte
d happened (1.7%, box 17), or some other 
type of incapacitated sexual
 assault (1.0%, box 18).  
Risk Factors for Sexual Assault Since Entering College 
Three multivariate models were used to identify how prior sexual victimization, substance 

use, lifestyle activities, and de
mographic characteristics were 
associated with women™s risk 
of experiencing physically forced sexual assa
ult only, incapacitated se
xual assault only, or both physically forced and incapacitated sexual
 assault since entering college. Results from each of the three models are presented in Figu
re 2.  Overall, the findings suggested that 
although several risk factors were consistently associated with
 all types of sexual assault, 
there were also some clear diffe
rences by sexual
 assault type. 
Physically Forced Sexual Assault.
  Women who experienced physically forced sexual assault 
before entering college had almost 7 times the odds of experiencing forced sexual assault 

since entering college (OR = 6.6) compared to other women.  However, experiencing sexual 
assault when incapacitated before
 college was not significantly associated with experiencing forced sexual assault since entering college.   None of the five measures of substance us
e since entering college
 were statistically associated with being a victim 
of forced sexual assault during
 college. The number of sexual 
partners women had since entering college was 
significantly and positi
vely associated with an increased risk of forced 
sexual assault (OR = 1.4).  In addition, women who had been 
threatened/humiliated and/or physically hurt by a dating partner since entering college had 
just over 7 times the odds of experiencing fo
rced sexual assault sinc
e entering college (OR = 7.4) compared to other women.   
Regarding demographics, no ra
cial/ethnic differences emerge
d.  Years in college was 
positively associated with experiencing physically forc
ed sexual assault since entering 
college (OR = 1.2). This finding is not surprising given that the more years a woman has 
been in college, the more exposure she ha
s had to potentially 
being assaulted since entering college.  However, upon examining 
when
 sexual assault is most likely to occur (by 
restricting the analyses to se
xual assaults occurring within the past 12 months, or since 
entering college for freshmen),
 the risk was greater for freshmen and sophomores than for 
juniors and seniors (data not shown). 
xiv  Section 1 Š Introduction Incapacitated Sexual Assault.
  A rather different set of risk
 factors was associated with 
incapacitated sexual assault. 
Experiencing incapacitated se
xual assault before college increased the odds of experiencing incapacitate
d sexual assault since 
entering college more 
than three-fold (OR = 3.7); however, experienci
ng physically forced sexual assault before 
college was not significantly asso
ciated with experiencing incapacitated sexual assault since entering college.   
All but one of the substance use measures were 
significantly and positively associated with the likelihood of experiencing 
incapacitated sexual
 assault since ente
ring college.  The 
frequencies with which women reported getting
 drunk since entering college increased the 
odds of being an incapacitate
d sexual assault vict
im (OR = 1.7), as did marijuana use (OR 
= 1.5); however, voluntary use of other illicit
 drugs was not associat
ed with experiencing incapacitated sexual assault 
since entering college. The frequency with which women 
reported being drunk during sex 
also increased the odds of be
ing a victim of incapacitated 
sexual assault (OR = 1.5), and having been given a drug without one™s knowledge or 
consent since entering college in
creased the odds of being a vi
ctim of incapacitated assault since entering college (OR = 2.8).  
The frequency with which women attended frat
ernity parties since entering college was 
positively associated with being a victim of incapacitate
d sexual assault (OR=1.4).  Women 
who were humiliated or hurt by a dating partne
r had just over 2 times the odds of being a 
victim of incapacitated sexual assault since entering colle
ge (OR = 2.2), compared to other 
women. As seen in the analysis of physically forced sexual assaults, the more years a 
woman has been in college, the greater th
e odds that she experienced incapacitated 
assault.  Both Physically Forced and Incapacitated Sexual Assault.
  Victims of forced sexual assault 
before college had higher odds
 (OR = 3.7) of experiencing 
both types of 
sexual assault since entering college. The same was true for vi
ctims of incapacitated sexual assault before 
college (OR = 2.1). Also interesting is that when the individual indicators for physically 
forced sexual assault before 
college and incapacitated sexual
 assault before college were 
replaced with a single combined indicator for experienced both physically forced 
and incapacitated sexual assault 
before college, those women wh
o experienced both types of 
prior victimizations (n=109) had almost 8 time
s the odds of experienced both physically 
forced and incapacitated sexu
al assault during college, compared to other women (OR = 
7.8, analyses not shown).     
xv  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
The frequency with which women reported 
getting drunk since entering college was 
positively associated with being a victim of both physically forced and incapacitated assault 
(OR = 1.7). In addition, having been given a drug without one™s knowledge or consent since 
entering college was strongly 
associated with experiencing both types 
of assault during 
college (OR =  6.7).  The number of sexual
 partners a woman has had since entering 
college increased the risk of 
being a victim of both types of sexual victimization since 
entering college (OR= 1.3).  As in the models of women™s experiences with physically forced 
sexual assault or in
capacitated sexual assault, the model of 
both physically forced sexual 
assault and incapacitated sexual
 assault indicated that the me
asure of women™s experiences 
with dating partner violence wa
s strongly associated with experiencing both types of sexual 
assault (OR = 5.2).  Only on
e demographic variable was si
gnificantly associated with experiencing both physically 
forced and incapacitated sexual
 assault during college. Women 
in the ﬁotherﬂ race category, compared to
 being white, had an increased odds of 
experiencing both physically forced and incapa
citated sexual 
assault since entering college (OR = 2.0). Context, Consequences, Reporting of Se
xual Assault Since Entering College 
Based on the extensive follow-up questions 
asked of women who reported experiencing 
sexual assault, several 
findings related to the context of 
sexual assault were generated from 
the study.  Regarding characte
ristics of the assailant, few vi
ctims reported being assaulted 
by someone they had never seen or talked to
 before, with victims of physically forced 
sexual assault much more like
ly than incapacitated assault victims to be assaulted by 
someone they had never seen or talked to (23% vs. 12%, respectively), or by a former 

intimate partner (20% vs. 9%, respectively). Ov
er a quarter of incapa
citated sexual assault victims reported that the assailant was a fraternity member at the time of the incident; this 

proportion is significantly higher than that reported by victims of physically forced sexual 

assault (28% vs. 14%, respectively).  Not surp
risingly, the vast majority of incapacitated 
sexual assault victims 
(89%) reported drinking alcohol, 
and being drunk (82%), prior to 
their victimization. This is much higher than 
the proportion of physically forced victims who 
reported drinking (33%) and 
being drunk (13%) prior to their assault. Drug use was 
relatively low among both groups, although a 
slightly higher proportion of incapacitated 
sexual assault victims reported
 having voluntarily used drugs before the incident (8% vs. 
2%). A surprisingly large number of respondents reported that
 they were at a party when 
the incident happened, with a significantly larg
er proportion of incapacitated sexual assault 
victims reporting this setting (58% compared 
with 28%). The majority of sexual assault 
xvi  Section 1 Š Introduction victims of both types reported that the 
incident had happened off campus (61% of 
incapacitated sexual assault victims and 63% of physically 
forced sexual assault victims). A 
low proportion of victims reporting that sustaining injuries in the assault, although more  
physically forced sexual assault victims (18%
) reported being injured than incapacitated 
sexual assault victims (3%).  
Several findings regarding the informal and 
formal reporting of the event are also of interest. The majority of victims of both types 
of assault (70% of physically forced victims 
and 64% of incapacitated sexual 
assault victims) reported that 
they told someone such as a 
family member, friend, roommate, or intimate partner. A very small percentage of victims 
reported that they contacted a victim™s, crisis, or
 health care center af
ter the incident.  This 
type of disclosure was more pr
evalent among physically forced
 sexual assault victims (16%) 
than incapacitated sexu
al assault victims (8%). A similarly small proportion of victims of 
both types of sexual assault stated that they
 reported the incident to a law enforcement 
agency, with incapacitated sexu
al assault victims on
ce again being less likely to report the 
incident (2% vs. 13%). Of the victims who did not report the incident to law enforcement, 

the most commonly reported reasons for non-reporting were that they did not think it was 
serious enough to report (endor
sed by 56% of physically forc
ed sexual assault victims and 67% of incapacitated sexual 
assault victims), that it was unclear that a crime was 
committed or that harm was intended (endorsed by
 just over 35% of both types of victims), 
and that they did not want 
anyone to know about the incident (endorsed by 42% of 
physically forced sexual assault victims and 29% of incapacitated sexu
al assault victims).  Victims were asked about othe
r actions they took as a re
sult of the incident and 
consequences received by the assailant. Beyond avoiding or trying to avoid the assailant 
(reported by about two-thirds of victims of 
both sexual assault types), respondents were 
unlikely to report action stemming from the assault. Twenty-two percent of physically forced 

sexual assault victims and 6% 
of incapacitated sexual assaul
t victims reported that they 
sought psychological counseling, 
a statistically significant diffe
rence. Not surprisingly, given the very low percentage of victims who reported the incident
 to law enforcement, a very 
small number of victims of either type of sexual assault reported 
that they pursued any 
action against the assailant, including seeking a restraining order, filing civil charges, 
pursuing criminal charges, or filing a grievance or initiating other disciplinary action with 
university officials. A very small number of vi
ctims reported that the assailant received any 
disciplinary action from the university or that
 the assailant was arrested, prosecuted, or 
convicted by the criminal justice system. 
xvii  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDAITONS 
 Sexual assault is clearly an issue in need of attention by the campus community given its 
high prevalence and adverse consequences, an
d the CSA Study results carry many social 
and policy-oriented implications. One out of 
five undergraduate women experience an 
attempted or completed sexual assaul
t during their college years, with: 
 the majority of sexual assaults occurring when women are incapacitated due to their 

use of substances, primarily alcohol;  
 freshmen and sophomores at greater risk fo
r victimization than 
juniors and seniors; 
and  the large majority of victims of sexual assault being victimized by men they know 

and trust, rather than strangers.  
It is important that sexual assault preventi
on strategies and messa
ges be designed such 
that undergraduates are educated (and as soon after enrollment as possible) about these 

facts.  Programs should focus on both 
primary prevention for women who have not 
experienced sexual assault and se
condary prevention in an effo
rt to prevent re-victimization 
(although more research is needed to gu
ide the development of effective secondary prevention programming).  Sexual assault prevention programs for women could: 
 Provide accurate information on legal definitions of sexual assault, the extent and 

nature of sexual assault among college women, and risk factors for sexual assault 

(e.g., risky sexual behaviors, multiple sex partners, the role of substances); 
 Combine sexual assault prevention education with alcohol and drug education 

programming (e.g., education concerning how levels of alcohol consumption and use 
of different drugs, and their 
interactions, affect cognitiv
e functions; harm reduction 
messages; education about the impact of 
alcohol and drug use, especially heavy 
episodic drinking, has on cognitive functions, which reduces one™s ability to detect 
dangerous cues and threats, and one™s ability to effectively resist unwanted advances 

that can arise in common college social situations);  Stress that even 
though many sexual assaults invo
lves substance use by the victim, 
this does not imply that women are to blame for their sexual assault. Victimization is 
xviii  Section 1 Š Introduction committed by the perpetrator, 
and therefore the sole responsibility for the assault 
lies with the perpetrator; 
 Educate women about different types of se
xual assault, especially since there appears to be continuity in the type of
 sexual assault expe
rienced over time (physically forced or incapa
citated sexual assault);   Teach effective sexual assault resistance strategies to reduce harm
, particularly with 
respect to strategies for protection fr
om men that women know and trust;  
 Educate women about how to increase th
eir assertiveness and self-efficacy;  
 Convey knowledge about how to report to poli
ce or school officials, the availability of 
different types of services on and off campus; 
 Stress the importance of re
porting incidents of attempted and completed sexual 
assault to mental and/or 
physically health service pr
oviders and security/law 
enforcement personnel, and th
e importance to seeking serv
ices, especially given the 
well-documented negative im
pacts sexual assault can ha
ve on psychological and 
physical functioning.  
In addition, programs for men to preven
t sexual assault perpetration could:  Provide accurate information on legal definitions of and legal penalties for sexual 
assault;  Inform men that they are ultimately respon
sible for determining (1) whether or not a 
women has consented to sexual contact, an
d (2) whether or not a women is capable 
of providing consent; and 
 Educate men that an intoxicated person cann
ot legally consent to sexual contact and 
that having sexual contac
t with an intoxicated or incapacitated person is 
unacceptable. 
All of these prevention programs 
should be tailored to include risk factors that both college 
women and men encounter in common college so
cial interactions/situations. Moreover, the 
programs should be designed as continuing educational curriculums rather than brief, ﬁone 
shotﬂ doses since research suggests that 
the former approach is more helpful. 
xix  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
Sexual assault is a serious social, public safety, and public health problem that affects men 
and women across the country. The CSA Study da
ta suggest women at universities are at 
considerable risk for experiencing sexual assa
ult, especially sexual assault occurring after 
the voluntary consumption of alcohol, and that 
a number of personal and behavioral factors 
are associated with increased risk. It is our 
hope that universities can take the information 
produced by the CSA Study and us
e it to reduce the prevalence of sexual assault, as well as 
improve the resources for and respon
se to sexual assault victims. 
xx   1. INTRODUCTION 
Sexual assault is a public health and public safety problem with far-reaching implications. 
Being a victim of sexual assault is one of the most violating 
experiences anyone can endure 
and can cause immediate, as well as long-term,
 physical and mental health consequences. 
Of rape victims, 25% to 45% suffer from nongenital trauma; 19% to 22% suffer from 
genital trauma; up to 40% get sexually tr
ansmitted diseases (S
TDs); and 1% to 5% 
become pregnant, resulting in an estimated 32,000 rape-related
 pregnancies in the United 
States annually (Holmes, Resnick, Kirkpatric
k, & Best, 1996). Victims of sexual assault 
report increasing their visits to physicians by 18% the year of the assault, by 56% the year 

after the assault, and by 31% 2 years after th
e assault (Koss, 1993). Fo
ur out of five rape 
victims subsequently suffer from chronic physical or psychological conditions (Strategies for 

the Treatment and Prevention of Sexual Assa
ult, 1995), and rape victims are 13 times more 
likely to attempt suicide than noncrime victims and six times more likely than victims of 
other crimes (Rape in America: A Report to the Nation, 1992). An estimated 25% to 50% of 
rape and child sexual abuse victims receive so
me sort of mental health treatment as a 
result of the victimizat
ion (Miller, Cohen, & Wierama, 1996).
 Overall, rape is believed to carry the highest annual victim cost of any crime. The annual 
victim costs are $127 billion 
(excluding child sex abuse cases), followed 
by assault at $93 billion per year, murder 
(excluding arson and drunk driving) at $61 b
illion per year, and child abuse at $56 billion 
per year (Miller, Co
hen, & Wierama, 1996). Given the substantial impact sexual victimization has on individual victims and society, 
collecting information that advances our understanding of sexual assault and helps us 

prevent victimization and better meet the needs of victims is critical. Although a substantial 
body of research exists, additi
onal data are needed to help 
document the current magnitude 
of the problem, the extent to which certain 
subpopulations are impacted, the consequences 
and reporting (or nonreporting) of victimizatio
n incidents, and strate
gies for preventing perpetration and reducing victims™
 risk of sexual assault and effectively respond to victims.  One subpopulation that is often believed to be at elevated risk for sexual assault is college 
students. Although meth
odological variation renders comp
arisons difficult to make, some previous studies suggest that university wo
men are at greater risk than women of a 
comparable age in the general 
population (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000; DeKeseredy & 
Kelly, 1993; Koss, Gidycz, & Wisnie
wski, 1987). This pattern is 
likely due to the close daily 
interaction between men and women in a range of 
social situations experienced in university 
settings (Fisher, Sloan, Cullen,
 & Lu, 1988), as well as frequent exposure to alcohol and 
other drugs.  
The risk of sexual assault rela
ted to alcohol and/or other drug consumption is particularly 
high among university women. The relationship between substance use and sexual assault 
experienced by university women has been well documented (Mohler-Kuo, Dowdall, Koss, & 
1-1  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
Wechsler; 2004; Tyler, Hoyt, & Whitbeck, 
1998; Koss & Dinero, 1989; Koss, Gidycz, & 
Wisniewski, 1987; Muehlenhard & Ma, 1987). Spec
ifically, previous researchers have: 1) 
identified high levels of ﬁpre-assaultﬂ alco
hol use (i.e., alcohol use at the time of the 
incident) among both victims and perpetrators 
of sexual assault (Hin
dmarch & Brinkmann, 
1994; Koss & Dinero, 1989; Muehlenhard & Ma, 
1987), 2) established that general drinking 
behavior (i.e., not limited to pre-assault) on 
the part of college women is risk factor for 
subsequent sexual assault victimization (Fisher, Cullen, and Turner, 2000; Greene and 
Navarro 1998; Mohler-Kuo et 
al., 2004), and 3) documented that substance abuse is a 
consequence of sexual assault (Kaysen, Neighbor
s, Martell, Fossos, and Larimer, in press; 
Gidycz, Hanson, & Layman, 1995; Kilpatrick, Ac
ierno, Resnick, Saunders, & Best, 1997). 
However, the role of alcohol and drugs in 
achieving
 sexual assault is not well understood, 
and the nature of this relationship can take 
several forms. For example, some assaults are 
directly facilitated by coercive or nonconsensual drug ingestion, and others are enabled by 
the victim being incapacitated through voluntary alcohol or drug use. Developing a typology 
of sexual assault and understanding the frequency and context of each type of assault could 
have important prevention, risk reduction, and response implications.  
RTI International was funded by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to conduct the 
Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study. The CSA Study was undertaken specifically to 
document the prevalence of distinct types of sexual assaul
t among university women, as 
well as the context, consequences
, and reporting of distinct ty
pes of sexual assault among a 
large sample of undergraduate women from two 
large universities. In 
the CSA Study, sexual 
assault includes a wide range of victimizations, including rape and other types of unwanted 
sexual contact (e.g., sexual battery). Consis
tent with previous re
search and most legal 
definitions, we define rape as unwanted sexu
al penetration (vaginal, anal, oral, or object 
penetration by an offender) achi
eved either through physical 
force, threat of force, or 
incapacitation of the victim.  
The CSA Study builds upon previous research 
and makes a number of contributions to the 
field. First, the CSA Study is one of the firs
t to generate estimates of the prevalence of 
drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA), which 
is when a woman is sexually assaulted when 

she is incapacitated after having been give
n a drug without her knowledge or consent, 
among a college sample. The concept of DFSA 
has received widespread attention from the 
media and a variety of stakehol
ders, including prevention and 
risk reduction specialists, 
treatment providers, law enforcement, and university administrators, bu
t empirical data on the prevalence and nature of th
is phenomenon have yet to appe
ar in the literature. Second, we collected the CSA data using a Web-base
d survey. This methodology is incredibly 
efficient and allowed respondents to answer the CSA survey 
questions on their own time 
and in complete privacy. We documented that it is possible to collect these data using a 
Web-based survey, which is important since collecting data using a computerized, self-
administered surveys has proven to increase th
e quality and validity of data (Turner, et al. 
1-2  Section 1 Š Introduction 1998). Many interviewer-administered or group-ad
ministered modes that 
have been used in 
the past to collect these data introduce th
reats to validity and human subjects-related 
concerns. Third, we explore some potential 
risk factors for sexual assault with more 
specificity than have previous researchers. 
For example, we explore whether risk factors 
vary by type of assault and we believe this is 
the first study to find that the type of sexual 
assault a woman has experienced in the past pu
ts her at risk for experiencing that same 
type, but not another type, of sexual assault in the future. A finding like this may help 
prevention and service provider
s tailor their efforts and take into account what type of 
sexual assault a woman has experienced 
or may be at risk of experiencing. 
1.1 A Typology of Sexual Assault 
Researchers in the field of sexual victimization have long recognized that the variability in 
the types of sexual assaults sugg
ests the need to classify inci
dents into distinct types. For 
example, one commonly used classification is based on th
e relationship between the 
perpetrator and the victim, distinguishing between stranger 
rapes and acquaintance rapes 
(with the latter category often further classifi
ed into date rapes an
d acquaintance rapes). 
This classification is based on the recognit
ion that the various assault types occur under 
different circumstances and th
at these circumstances someti
mes differentially impact the 
victim and related outcomes (e.g., likelihood of reporting). Although useful in informing the 
content of prevention programs, the fact that the vast majority
 of sexual assaults (both in 
the general population and among university 
women) are committed by individuals known 
to the offender limits the utility of this classification (when employed in isolation).  
Another typology, and one that guides the classi
fication of sexual assault in the CSA Study, is based on how the assault was achieved. Virtually all 
sexual assault rese
arch distinguishes between assaults occurring as a result of 
physical force or threats of physical force
 from assaults that do not involve the use or threat
 of force. In the CSA Study, we consider 
physically forced sexual assault as a distinct 
category of assault. Ma
ny studies also attempt to capture unwanted sexual co
ntact achieved by the use of 
verbal or emotional coercion
. This type of sexual encounter, although unwant
ed or regretted, is often not classified as 
sexual victimization or sexual
 assault. In the CSA Study, we measure unwanted sexual 
contact resulting from verbal/emotional coercion
 but do not include it as a type of sexual 
assault. A third means through which sexual assault is achieved is 
incapacitation of the 
victim
. Legal definitions of sexual assault factor in one™s ability to provide consent, and 
individuals who are incapacitate
d because of the effects of alcohol or drugs (or otherwise 
incapacitated, such as when they are unconsc
ious or asleep) are incapable of consenting. 
Unlike sexual contact achieved by physical force or verbal/emotional coercion, previous 
research on incapacitated sexual assault has not been approa
ched with consistency from either a conceptual or measurement perspectiv
e. Because a primary goal of the CSA Study 
is to contribute to the knowledge about inca
pacitated sexual assaul
t (with incapacitated 
1-3  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
sexual assault treated as a dist
inct type of sexual assault in the CSA Study, with several 
subtypes identified), the manner in which previous research has approached this type of 
assault is discussed in some detail below. Before beginning this discussion, however, it is 
important to point out that, although the pr
eceding discussion has outlined three primary 
means by which sexual assault is achieved as the first level of a typology of assault types, 
we recognize that in actuality a single assaul
t could be achieved by more than one means. 
For example, a woman who is extremely drunk (incapacitated) could be forcibly held down 
and rapedŠin which case the assault could be 
classified as both physically forced and 
incapacitated rape. 1.1.1 Incapacitated Sexual Assault 
The general relationship between substanc
e use and sexual assault has been well 
documented, especially with re
spect to research focusing 
on university samples (Mohler-
Kuo, Dowdall, Koss, & Wechsler; 2004; Tyle
r, Hoyt, & Whitbeck, 1998; Koss & Dinero, 
1989; Koss, Gidycz, & Wisniewski, 1987; Mueh
lenhard & Ma, 1987). Substance use can 
incapacitate a victim or make it difficult for her to consent to or refuse sexual activity. It 

may also decrease a perpetrator™s sense of resp
onsibility or awareness of his behavior, lead 
to the misinterpretation of cues, diminish the victim™s ability to prevent an assault, or lead 
to women taking risks they 
might otherwise avoid (Testa, 
Livingston, & Collins, 2000; 
Abbey, Ross, & McDuffie,
 1994; Abbey, 1991).  
Numerous studies have addressed the relati
onship between substance use and sexual 
assault by considering substance use as a contextual factor associated with sexual assault. 
For example, several studies have reported that over half of 
the victims and perpetrators of 
sexual assault among college students had b
een drinking alcohol prior to the assault 
(Hindmarch & Brinkmann, 1994; Koss & Dinero, 1989; Muehlenha
rd & Ma, 1987). In their 
national study of college wome
n, Koss (1988) found that 55% 
of rape victims and 74% of 
rape perpetrators had been drinking alcoho
l. In the National College Women Sexual 
Victimization (NCWSV) study, 43% of the sexual victimization incidents involved alcohol 
consumption by victims and 69% involved alcohol consumption by the perpetrator (Fisher, 
Daigle, Cullen, & Turner, 2003). Other estimate
s of drug and/or alcohol use based on 
victims™ reports suggest that 20
% of victims and 63% of perpetrators were drinking or using 
drugs prior to the assault (Ulman & Breklin, 2000).  
These findings clearly demonstrate that a strong relationship
 exists between substance use 
and sexual assault. However, 
they do not identify sexual 
assault incidents that occurred 
because of victim incapacitati
on. Many students drink withou
t becoming incapacitated, and it would be inappropriate to assume that any incidents in which the victim was drinking 

could be classified as incapacitated sexual
 assaults. Findings illustrating that large 
proportions of victims and perpetrators enga
ge in substance use simply help document 
1-4  Section 1 Š Introduction substance use as a potential risk factor for both victimization and perpetration of sexual 
assault. Part of the reason that incapacitated sexual 
assault has been approached inconsistently by 
previous researchers is lack of agreement on wh
ether this type of sexual assault ought to be 
restricted to incidents in which the perp
etrator was responsible for the victim™s incapacitation. Some studies have
 been designed to only ﬁco
untﬂ as incapaci
tated assaults 
those in which the perpetrator was responsible 
for the victim™s incapacitation. For example, 
in the original Sexual Experiences Survey
 (SES - Koss, Gidycz, & Wisniewski, 1997), 
respondents were asked ﬁHave you had sexual in
tercourse when you didn™t want to because 
a man made you intoxicated by giving you alco
hol or drugs?ﬂ Based on this measure, 45% 
of the rape incidents experience
d by women in Koss et al.™s national study of college women 
were reported to have occurre
d subsequent to the intentional administration of alcohol 
and/or drugs (Koss, Gidycz, & Wisniewski, 1987).
 Because of the increasing media attention 
and anecdotal reports of drugs being administ
ered clandestinely to immobilize victims, 
impair memory, and facilitate rape, some re
searchers attempted to further distinguish 
incapacitated sexual assault in which the pe
rpetrator was responsi
ble for the victim™s 
incapacitation in a manner that was unknown 
to her. For example, 
Testa, Livingston, and 
Vanzile-Tamsen (2003) modified the SES item on
 assailant-administered alcohol or drugs by 
adding ﬁwithout your knowledgeﬂ to the end of 
the item. This type of incapacitated sexual 
assault involves coercion on the part of 
the perpetrator and is often known as drug-
facilitated sexual 
assault (DFSA).  
In the CSA Study, we consider as incapacitate
d sexual assault any unwanted sexual contact 
occurring when a victim is unable to provide consent or stop what is happening because she 

is passed out, drugged, drunk, incapacita
ted, or asleep, regardless of whether the 
perpetrator was responsible for her substance use or whether substances were administered 
without her knowledge. This is consistent with
 the work of Testa et al., who, focusing 

exclusively on rape, considered
 incapacitated rape to include unwanted sexual intercourse 
when the victim was incapacitated because of alcohol or drug
s, regardless of whether the 
substance(s) had been consumed voluntarily or not (Testa, Livingston, & Vanzile-Tamsen, 
2003).  However, in the CSA Study, we
 further break down incapacita
ted sexual assault into four 
subtypes. The first two subtypes pertain to se
xual assaults achieved when the victim is 
givenŠwithout her knowledge or
 consentŠa substance that physically incapacitates her and 
makes her incapable of providing consent. 
DFSA
 (drug-facilitated sexual assault) is defined 
as unwanted sexual contact occurring when 
the victim is incapacitated and unable to 
provide consent after she had been given a drug without her knowledge or consent. 
Incidents classified as DFSA are 
those in which the victim is 
certain that she had been 
drugged. In contrast, 
SDFSA 
(suspected drug-facilitated se
xual assault) is defined as 
incapacitated sexual assault 
occurring after the victim 
suspects
 that she had been given a 
1-5  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
drug without her knowledge or consent. Our co
nceptualization of DFSA is consistent with 
other definitions (for example, the American Prosecutors 
Research Institute [1999] defines 
DFSA as sexual assault facilitated by the administration of ﬁanesthesia-typeﬂ drugs, which 
physically incapacitate the victim and make he
r incapable of giving or withholding consent); 
however, we do not restrict 
the categorization to ﬁanesthesia-typeﬂ drugs only. Although 
drugs commonly reported in association with DFSA include Rohypnol (flunitrazepam), 

gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), Ketamine (a 
general anesthetic), MDMA (ecstasy), and 
Soma (carisoprodol) (LeBeau et al., 1999; U.S. Department of Justice, 2003), any drug can 
be administered without the victim™s knowledge.
2  The third type of incapacitate
d sexual assault considered in the CSA Study is termed 
alcohol and/or other drug- (AOD-) enabled sexual assault. 
We recognize that most women who 
drink or use drugs do so voluntarily and that the vast majority of situations in which a 
woman is incapacitated because of the effects of alcohol or drugs are not caused by coercive 
or clandestine action on the part of anothe
r individual. However, if a woman experiences 
unwanted sexual contact when she is incapa
citated and unable to provide consent because 
of voluntary consumption of alcohol or othe
r drugs, a sexual a
ssault has nonetheless occurred. We consider the assault to be dire
ctly enabled by the use of alcohol or other 
drugs. Although it is important to distingu
ish between DFSA and se
xual assault occurring after voluntary substance abuse, we believe that both are clear instances of incapacitated 
sexual assault and classi
fy them accordingly. 
To distinguish between incapa
citation due to the effects of AOD (administered either 
coercively or voluntarily) and other types of 
incapacitation, we include a fourth type of 
incapacitated sexual assault in our typology. 
Other incapacitated sexual assaults 
capture the remaining, and likely uncommon, situations in which a victim can be incapacitated, such as 

by being asleep or unconscious. The basic compon
ents of this typology of sexual assault are 
presented in Exhibit 1-1. 
                                         
 2Even alcohol could be administered without the vict
im™s knowledge. For example, a victim could be 
told that a drink contains no alcohol.

ed 247,730 incidents of rape or sexual assault, with the highest rate
s reported among 16- to 19-year-old (10.4 per 
1,000) and 20- to 24-year-old women (5.4 pe
r 1,000) (DOJ, BJS Web site, 2004). Although 
methodological variation makes comparisons di
fficult, some previous 
studies suggest that university women are at greater risk than women of a comparable age in the general 
population (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000;
 DeKeseredy & Kelly, 
1993; Koss, Gidycz, & 
Wisniewski, 1987), probably because of the cl
ose daily interaction between men and women 
in a range of social situations 
experienced in university settings (Fisher, Sloan, Cullen, & Lu, 
1988). Using items similar to the NCVS, the NCWSV studyŠa telephone survey with a 
national sample of 4,446 college womenŠ
found that 2.8% of college women had 
experienced a completed and/or attempted 
rape during the current academic year
3 and estimated that between 20% and 25% of women will experience a completed and/or 
attempted rape during their college career (Fis
her, Cullen, & Turner, 2000). A prior study of 
a national sample of more than 6,000 students enrolled in
 32 colleges and universities 
reported that 27% of the women had experi
enced attempted (12%) or completed (15%) 
rape in their lifetime (Koss, Gidycz, & Wisniewski, 1987).  In addition to generating estimates of at
tempted and/or completed rape, much of the 
existing research has also explor
ed the prevalence of sexual victimization at a general level. 
For example, in the NCWSV, 15.5% of college women reported being sexually victimized 
during the academic year in which the data were collected (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000). 
Koss (1988) found that 44% of the college wome
n in her sample reported some type of 
sexual victimization within a 1-year period. A single-site, longitudinal study of 100 college 
women found that 29% of the sample reported being sexually victimized (including sexual 
contact, sexual coercion, attempted rape, or rape) by a dati
ng partner in the 32 months 
since entering college (Himelein, 1995). The prevalence of 
lifetime sexual victimization by a                                          
 3However, because the survey was conducted from February to May 1997, the average time period 
about which study participants responded was only 7 months.  
2-1  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
dating partner was 52%, with 38% having been se
xually victimized in dating situations prior 
to entering colleg
e (Himelein, 1995). With respect to the prevalence of the distinct 
types of sexual assault introduced previously 
(physically forced and incapacitated sexual assault, with 
incapacitated assault further 
classified as DFSA, AOD enabled, and other in
capacitated sexual assa
ult), studies conducted 
with university women have shown that incidents achieved by using physical force are less 
common than those not involving physical force (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000). Few 
previous studies have examined 
incapacitated sexual assault using a definition similar to the 
one employed in the CSA Study. However, th
e Harvard School of Public Health College 
Alcohol Study (CAS) specifically asked about sexual intercourse when the victim was so 

intoxicated that she was unable to provide consent. In 2001, the prevalence of this type of 

rape was 3.2% and accounted for 72% of all ra
pes (Mohler-Kuo, Dowdall, Koss, & Wechsler, 
2004). Although the current revi
ew focuses primarily on sexual assault experienced by university women, a community-based study conduc
ted by Testa et al. is relevant due to its 
distinction between forcible rape and incapa
citated rape. Among a community-based sample 
of women aged 18 to 30, 9.4% reported experiencing nonconsensual sexual intercourse 

since the age of 14 when incapacitated (Testa
, Livingston, Vanzile-Tamsen, & Frone, 2003). 
This classification includes women who reported they were 
incapacitated because of their 
use of alcohol or drugs and were not able 
to prevent unwanted sexual intercourse from 
taking place (8.4%), as well as
 women who reported having se
xual intercours
e when they 
did not want to because a man made them in
toxicated by giving th
em alcohol or drugs 
without their knowledge (3.1%). Interestingly, 
the prevalence of incapacitated rape (9.4%) 
was roughly equivalent to the prevalence of forcible rape (10.7%). However, in this study, 
incapacitated rape was limited to situations in which the victim was passed out or unaware 
of what was happening. An expanded definition 
of incapacitation (suc
h as the one employed 
in the CSA Study) would likely have generated 
a substantially higher 
prevalence estimate for incapacitated rape. Although research such as the Testa et al. (2003) study indi
cates that the prevalence of 
DFSA is very low (in their study, 3.1% of the sample reported having unwanted sexual 
intercourse because they were given a substanc
e without their knowledge
), it is extremely 
difficult to confirm the true prevalence of DFSA, primarily because victims may not know 
with certainty that they were
 administered a substance or whether they were sexually 
assaulted. ﬁDate rape drugs,ﬂ if they are ad
ministered, have properties that make them 
particularly difficult to detect. Most are colo
rless and odorless, and ca
n rapidly (i.e., within 
20 minutes for Rohypnol, GHB, and Ketamine) indu
ce sleep or sedation and an inability to 
recollect events (anterograde amnesia); these 
depressive effects are magnified when used 
with alcohol (LeBeau et al., 1999). In addition, de
tection is difficult because the drugs have 
a short half-life (e.g., GHB can only be detected within 12 hours of ingestion, and the 
psychomotor impairments it causes last a few hours [Smith, 1999]), and some of these 
2-2  Section 2 Š Background substances (e.g., Ketamine) cannot be detect
ed or may be extremely difficult to detect 
because of limitations in existing te
sting methods (Pope & Shouldice, 2001).  
These methodological challenges make it ex
tremely difficult to 
generate prevalence 
estimates of DFSA. Several forensic toxicology
 laboratories have de
veloped estimates, but 
these figures are of limited utility because they are based solely on cases in which a 
potential victim has come forward, DFSA is su
spected, and analyses have been conducted to 
confirm DFSA. For example, Slaughter (2000) reported that 61% of urine specimens from 

rape victims suspected by a rape treatment center examiner of containing drugs were found 

to contain alcohol and/or drugs, with alcohol present in 63
% of the positive samples, 
marijuana present in 30%, and GHB and Rohypnol in less than 3%. Similarly, ElSohly and 
Salamone (1999) reported that 60% of ur
ine samples submitted by law enforcement 
agencies, emergency rooms, and rape crisis centers (and provided by individuals claiming to 
have been sexually assaulted when drug use 
was suspected) were po
sitive for drugs (41% 
tested positive for alcohol, 18.5% for mari
juana, 8.2% for benzodiazepines, 8.2% for 
cocaine, 4.3% for amphetamine, 4.1% for GHB, 2.1% for opiates, 2.1% for propoxyphene, 
and 1% for barbiturates). These 
estimates are difficult to interpret, however, because they 
are based on data collected from victim
s who (1) suspected they were drugged, 
(2) reported the incident to a medical center
 or law enforcement agency, and (3) reported 
their victimization soon enough after the incide
nt for authorities to make the decision to 
take a sample and test for measurable traces of
 a substance (i.e., within 48 to 72 hours of 
ingestion). It is virtually impossible to use these ﬁconfirmationﬂ studies to calculate DFSA 
prevalence because limited data exist on th
e proportion of sexual assault victims who suspect they were victims of DFSA followi
ng ﬁunknownﬂ or nonconsensual ingestion. 
McGregor et al. (2003) reported that 12% 
of cases presenting at a hospital-based 
emergency service over a 7-year period were id
entified as suspected DFSA (based either on 
the victim™s own suspicion or the examiner™s opinion). Similarly, a recent Australian study 
found that of 434 adult sexual
 assault cases over a 12-month period, DFSA was suspected 
in 17.5% (n = 76) of these cases, although ﬁc
overtﬂ administration was suspected in only 
22 cases (and confirmed through toxicological ev
idence in only 15 cases) (Hurley, Parker, & 
Wells, 2006).  
2.2 The Context of Campus Sexual Assault 
In the vast majority of sexual assaults expe
rienced by university women, the perpetrator 
and victim know each other in some way. In 
the National Survey of College Women, 93% of 
sexual assault victims reported
 that they knew the perpetra
tor (Ullman, Karabatsos, & Koss, 
1999). Similarly, the NCWSV study reveal
ed that among the college women who 
experienced completed and/or attempted rape, the perpetrator (most commonly a 
classmate, friend, boyfriend or ex-boyfriend, or acquaintance) was known to the victim in 
nearly 90% of cases (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000). Interestin
gly, it has been suggested 2-3  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
that in sexual assaults involving substance use, the perpetrator and victim are 
less likely to 
be intimately acquainted than sexual assaults 
in which substance use is not involved (Abbey 
et al., 1996; Koss et al., 
1988; Ullman & Brecklin, 2000). In the NCWSV, victims were on a date with 
the perpetrator in 12.8% of completed rapes 
and 35% of attempted rapes (Fisher, Cullen,
 & Turner, 2000). In the National College 
Women™s Study, nearly 40% of women experien
cing sexual victimization were on a date 
with the perpetrator (Ullman, Karabatsos, & 
Koss, 1999). The NCWSV study also showed 
that respondents reported that 
the perpetrator was of the same 
race as the victim in nearly 
80% of the incidents (Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, & Turner, 2003).  
The NCWSV study identified several other contextu
al factors associated 
with sexual assault. 
Just over half of the completed rapes took
 place after midnight (with 36.5% occurring 
between 6 p.m. and midnight and only 12.8%
 occurring between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.) and 
most took place in living quarters. For all types of sexual victimizations, it was more 
common for students to be victimized off ca
mpus (66% of completed rapes occurred off 
campus) than on campus
4 (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000). 
In the NCWSV, the majority of victims reported employing some
 type of protective actionŠ
typically using physical force against the perpetrator. However, vict
ims of attempted rape were more likely to take protective action (par
ticularly using physical force) than victims of 
completed rape, which may suggest the effectiv
eness of such action
 at preventing the attempt from being successful
 (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 
2000). The National College 
Women™s Study also reported high levels of vi
ctim resistance (91%), yet the relationship 
between degree of victim resistan
ce and the outcome of the assault was the opposite of that 
observed in the NCWSV; women who resisted 
more during the assault (with resistance 
measured on a scale ranging from less forceful 
verbal resistance to more forceful physical 
resistance) reported greater severity of sexual victimization (with completed rape being the 
highest severity outcome). This pattern was more pronounced for victims who had not been 
drinking prior to the assault than for those who had been drinking (Ullman, Karabatsos, & 
Koss, 1999). In the National College Women™s Study, the assailant had a weapon in only 1.9% of sexual 
victimizations (Ullman, Karabatsos, & Koss, 1999). With respect to victim injury, NCWSV 
data show that the victim repo
rted experiencing an injury 
in about 20% of the completed 
and/or attempted rape incidents, with the most common inju
ry reported being ﬁbruises, black-eye, cuts, scratches, swelling, or chipped teethﬂ (Fis
her, Cullen, & Turner, 2000). 
Fewer respondents reported injuries from the 
other types of sexual victimization. Some 
                                         
 4The pattern of living on campus being a risk factor and most assaults occurring off campus is slightly 
counterintuitive; however, students who live on campus clearly participate in social activities off 
campus. In addition, living on campus may be a pr
oxy for year of study, 
given that other studies 
have found sexual assault more common among freshmen and sophomores (Meilman & Haygood-
Jackson, 1996). 
2-4  Section 2 Š Background studies have observed that victim injury is more likely when perpetrators had been using 
alcohol or other drugs prior to the incident 
(Coker et al., 1988; Martin & Bachman, 1998; 
Ullman & Brecklin, 2000) but others have 
not (Brecklin & Ullman
, 2001, 2002). Testa, 
Vanzile-Tamsen, and Livingston
 (2004) found that the relationship between perpetrator 
intoxication and increased likelihood of victim injury was specific to incidents in which the 
victim was sober. This interaction effect may 
be explained by either the possibility that 
sober women may resist more strongly, which may increase their chances of injury 
(although ultimately may reduce the severity of
 the sexual assault), or that perpetrators 
resort to force when the victim is not more vulnerable or susceptible as a result of 

intoxication (Testa, Vanzile-T
amsen, & Livingston, 2004). In one of the few studies to 
consider physically forced rape and incapacita
ted rape as distinct 
types of rape, Testa, 
Livingston, Vanzile-Tamsen, and Frone (2003) found that injury as a result of rape was 

significantly less likely to occur in incapacitated rape than forcible rape. Specifically, in their 

community-based sample of 18- to 30-year-old
 women, 33% of victims of incapacitated 

rape were injured during the assault compar
ed with 57% of victims of forcible rape. 
2.3 Risk Factors Associated
 with Sexual Assault  
Given the high prevalen
ce of sexual assault experienced by university women, much of the 
previous research has attempted to identify risk 
factors for sexual assaul
t. It is important to 
note that such efforts should not be construed 
as victim-blaming or as attempts to attribute 
responsibility for the incident to the victim. It
 is extremely important for the purposes of 
better targeting prevention programming to kn
ow as much as possible about factors that 
place certain individuals at greater risk for victimization.  
2.3.1 Prior Victimization 
One of the strongest predictors of sexual assault is prior victimization. In the NCWSV, 10% 
of the sample reported being raped prior to 
the start of the academic year in which the 
study was conducted; 11% reported a prior 
attempted rape (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 
2000). Women who had experienced a prior se
xual assault were 
shown to have an 
increased risk of sexual victimization during the current academic year (Fisher, Cullen, & 
Turner, 2000). Adolescents who 
experienced a completed or attempted rape are twice as 
likely to experience a subsequent sexual a
ssault during their college years (Hanson & 
Gidycz, 1993). Himelein™s (1995)
 longitudinal study of coll
ege women found that women 
who had experienced sexual victim
ization by a dating partner pr
ior to entering college were 
significantly more likely to be victimized during college, with prior victimization being the 
strongest predictor of victimization during college. In Himelein™s study, although precollege 
victimization by a dating partner strongly predicted victimization during college, childhood 
sexual abuse did not. In Gidycz, Hanson, and Layman™s 
(1995) longitudinal study, women 
who had been victimized during the first time
 period of the study were three time more likely than nonvictims to be revictimized during the second observation period.  
2-5  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
Several factors may mediate the relationship
 between previous and subsequent sexual 
assault including low self-esteem, depression, and poor psychological adjustment, all of 
which may increase vulnerability for revictimization. For example, Himelein suggested that 
ﬁa tendency to internalize blame suggests that victimization would exacerbate existing self-

doubts, making future attempts 
at assertion in sexual situations more difficultﬂ (1995, p. 
44). Another explanation posited for the greater risk of revic
timization among adolescents 
and young adults who have been sexually ab
used is that sexual and physical abuse contribute to the use of alcohol and other drugs, which can in turn place a previous victim at 
risk for future victimization (Watts & Wil
lis, 1993; Dembo, Williams, Wothke et al., 1992). 
Researchers have, in fact, documented that he
avy drinking may be a 
means of coping with 
the psychological distress following sexual assault (Grayson & 
Nolen-Hoeksema, 2005; Miranda, Meyerson, Long, Marx
, & Simpson, 2002). Several studies among college students 
have identified increased alcohol consumptio
n and a greater number of drinking-related 
negative consequences in sexual assault vi
ctims compared with nonvictims, using both 
cross-sectional (Corbin, Bernat, Calhoun,
 McNair, & Seals; 2001; Larimer, Lydum, 
Anderson, & Turner, 1999; Marx, Nichols-An
derson, Messman-Moore, Miranda, & Porter, 
2000; Koss & Dinero, 1989) and longitudinal 
(Kaysen, Neighbors, Martell, Fossos, and 
Larimer, in press; Gidycz, Hanson, & Layman, 1995; Kilpatrick, Acierno, Resnick, Saunders, 
& Best, 1997) designs.  
2.3.2 Substance Use 
Regardless of prior victimization status, alcohol consumption by the victim is a major risk 
factor for sexual assault. In the NCWSV, wo
men who frequently drank enough to get drunk 
were at greater risk of sexual victimization than those who did not (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 
2000). Mohler-Kuo et al. (2004) 
found that heavy episodic drinking was the strongest 
predictor of both rape when intoxicated and ot
her types of rape (physi
cally forced rape and 
rape due to threats of force); high school he
avy episodic drinking patterns were also 
significantly associated with the risk of rape while in college. The Harvard College Alcohol 
Study also found that drug use was associated wi
th an increased risk of
 rape (including rape when intoxicated and other types) (Mohle
r-Kuo, Dowdall, Koss, & Wechsler, 2004). 
Similarly, Greene and Navarro (1998) showed th
at heavy alcohol use predicted later sexual 
assault over the course of an academic ye
ar among college women. Interestingly, the 
severity of the outcome also appears to be affe
cted by alcohol and/or drug use by the victim 
and perpetrator. In the National College Wo
men™s Study, victims who reported getting 
drunk more often also reported more severe sexual victim
ization than victims who got 
drunk less often (Ullman, Kara
batsos, & Koss, 1999). Studie
s examining incapacitated sexual assault have found that early age of 
onset of drinking and frequency of alcohol 
consumption are associated with 
greater risk of incapacitated 
sexual assault and penetration 
(Testa, Livingston, & Leonard, 2003;
 Tyler, Hoyt, & Whitbeck, 1998).  
2-6  Section 2 Š Background 2.3.3 Age and Year of Study  
Freshmen and sophomore women appear to be at
 greater risk of being victims of sexual 
assault than are upperclassmen. A recent 
study employing a convenience sample of university women found that 84% of the women 
who reported sexually coercive experiences 
experienced the incident during their first four semesters 
on campus (Gross, Winslett, 
Roberts, & Gohm, 2006). Age itself may be a 
related risk factor. In the CAS, underage 
women were more likely to repo
rt being raped (including ra
pe when intoxicated) than 
women 21 or older (Mohler-Kuo, 
Dowdall, Koss, & Wechsler, 2004).  
2.3.4 Race/Ethnicity 
The role of race/ethnicity as 
a risk factor for campus sexual
 assault or rape has not been 
well studied, primarily because of the small number of minorities included in previous 
research. In Koss et al.™s (1987) Nation
al College Women Survey, Native American college 
women reported the highest incidence of ra
pe, and white women had higher rates than 
African American, Hispanic, and Asian women. Howe
ver, the role of race/ethnicity as a risk 
factor for sexual assault may differ depending 
on the type of assault. For example, the 
Harvard College Alcohol Study found that white undergraduate females were more likely to 
report experiencing rape when into
xicated than women of other races
5 (Mohler-Kuo et al., 
2004), which is likely due to the pattern of 
heavy alcohol use being more common among 
white college students (Wechsler et al., 
1994, 2000, 2000; Caetano et al., 1998). In the 
same study, white women were 
less likely to report experiencing other types of rape (which 
included physically forced rape and threats of
 force) than women of other races (Mohler-Kuo 
et al., 2004). Similarly, in a 
study conducted in a single So
utheastern university, Gross, 
Winslett, Roberts, and Gohm (2006) found significantly higher rates of physically forced 

sexual intercourse (and emotional coercion) 
for African American women compared with 
white women.  
2.3.5 Residential Status  
The Harvard College Alcohol Study found that st
udents who resided in 
sorority houses and 
on-campus dormitories were more 
likely to report ex
periencing rape than students residing 
off campus (Mohler-Kuo et al., 2004). In th
e NCWSV, women who resided on campus had 
an increased risk for sexual 
victimization occurring on campus (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 
2000).  2.3.6 Sorority Membership 
Sorority membership itself has been identified 
as a risk factor for sexual assault, including 
being a victim of alcohol or drug coercion (T
yler, Hoyt, & Whitbeck, 1998; Mohler-Kuo et al., 
2004; Copenhaver & Grauerholz, 1991; Kalof, 1993)
. This finding is probably due to the 
                                         
 5Although approximately 25% of the CAS sample was nonwhite, the breakdown of nonwhite students 
into specific racial/ethnic categories was not reported in the article.  
2-7  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
pattern of sorority women being 
more likely to drink (Tyler, Hoyt, & Whitbeck, 1998) and to 
associate with fraternity men, 
who have been identified as be
ing more likely to perpetrate 
sexual assault or sexual aggr
ession than nonfraternity men (Tyler, Hoyt, & Whitbeck, 1998; 
Lackie & deMan, 1997). Not surprisingly, previo
us research has documented that students 
who are members of Greek organizations dr
ink more frequently and heavily than 
nonmembers (Kilmer et al., 1999; Cashin, Presley,
 & Meilman, 1988), and it is questionable 
whether Greek affiliation is associated with sexual assault once alcohol consumption is 
controlled for analytically.  
2.3.7 Dating Violence History 
Although less well researched than many of the other factor
s discussed in this section, 
dating violence may be a risk factor for se
xual assault. The American College Health 
Association-National College Health Assessment (NCHA) stud
y found that women who were 
physically abused by a dating partner in any year were more likely to be sexually assaulted 

that year (American College
 Health Association, 2004). 
2.3.8 Consensual Sexual Experiences 
Engaging in consensual 
sexual activity is a risk factor for sexual assault (Tyler, Hoyt, & 
Whitbeck, 1998). A positive a
ssociation between sexual assa
ult and both the number of 
sexual partners and an earlier age of initiation of sexual activity has been identified (Gidycz, 
Hanson, & Layman, 1995; Koss & Dinero, 1989).  
2.3.9 Attitudinal Characteristics 
The role of victim attitudinal ch
aracteristics as a risk factor fo
r sexual victimization has also 
been explored by previous stud
ies, with very few significant relationships identified. For 
example, Koss and Dinero (1989) compared vic
tims and nonvictims on rape-supportive 
beliefs and did not find majo
r differences. A study conducted among a convenience sample 
of precollege women also did no
t find differences in rape-supportive belief scales or sexual 
conservativism between victim
s and nonvictims but found 
only a minimal association 
between acceptance of interpersonal violence and victimization (Vogel & Himelein, 1995). 
Adversarial sexual beliefs were significantly higher among victims in the Vogel and Himelein 
(1995) study, and in another cross-sectiona
l study, university women with sexually 
permissive attitudes were at hi
gher risk for several types of sexual coercive strategies 
(Tyler, Hoyt, & Whitbeck, 1998).  
However, it is widely acknowledged that unless these relationships are examined 
longitudinally, attitudes can be viewed as eith
er a precursor to, or consequence of, sexual 
victimization. In a longitudinal study invo
lving 100 women followed for 32 months, Himelein 
found that sexual conservatism
 (which encompasses traditiona
l, restrictive beliefs about 
sexual behaviors) was 
negatively associated with college sexual victimization; women who 
entered college with more sexually conservative attitudes were less likely to be sexually 
2-8  Section 2 Š Background victimized during college. The other attitudi
nal measures examined, including adversarial 
sexual beliefs, acceptance of interpersonal 
violence, and rape myth
 acceptance, did not 
significantly predict the likel
ihood of college sexual vict
imization (Himelein, 1995).  
2.4 Reporting of Sexual Assault  
Among the general population, approximately half
 of the rapes/sexual assaults reported in 
the 2002 NCVS were reported to the police (B
JS, 2003). Because date and acquaintance 
rapes are less likely to be reported than stra
nger rapes (Lott, Reilly, & Froward, 1982), the 
likelihood of reporting sexual assault is lower on college campuses. In the NCWSV study, 
completed and/or attempted rapes were reported to law enforc
ement officials in less than 5% of cases (Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, & Turner, 2003).  
Several barriers to reporting were identified by victims: (1) not having proof that the 
incident occurred, (2) fear of retaliation by th
e perpetrator, (3) fear of hostile treatment by 
the authorities, (4) uncertainty that the authorities would consider the incident serious 
enough, (5) not knowing how to report the inci
dent, and (6) desire to prevent family and 
others from learning about it (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000). Among victims included in 
the NCWSV, the most frequently
 cited reason for not reporting incidents to the police was 
because victims believed the event would not co
nsidered serious enough by authorities. In 
42.1% of the incidents, victim
s did not report the incident 
because they were not sure a 
crime or harm was attended, and in 30% of th
e incidents, victims believed the police would 
not think the incident was serious enough (Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, & Turner, 2003). For rape 

victims in particular, a commonly cited reason for not reporting the incident to any police 

agencies is not wanting family members and others to know about the victimization (38.9% 

of rape victims in the NCWSV cited this as a reason for failing to report the event). 
From the perspective of campus administrato
rs, some policies may discourage victims from 
reporting, such as campus policies on drug 
and alcohol use (victims who had been drinking 
may be concerned about reprisal for violating su
ch policies) and policies requiring victims to 
participate in adjudication (Karjane, Fish
er, & Cullen, 2005). Fa
ctors that encourage 
reporting (according to administrators) includ
e victim services, written law enforcement 
response protocols, coor
dination between campus and community, new student 
orientations, campus-wide publicity about pa
st crimes, having sexual assault peer 

educators, and policies allowing confidential and anonymous reporting (Karjane, Fisher, & 

Cullen, 2005). Although 84% of the institutions
 studied offered confidential reporting, less than half (46%) offered anonymous report
ing (Karjane, Fisher, & Cullen, 2005).  
Reluctance to report sexual a
ssault may also be related to th
e victim™s perceptions of the 
event. The NCWSV study found that, of th
e college women who experienced unwanted 
2-9  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
completed penetration6 by force or the threat of force, only 46.5% of the victims reported 
that they considered the incide
nt to be a rape (Fisher, Culle
n, & Turner, 2000). In Koss et 
al.™s (1988) study, only 27% of the women who reported experiencing 
an assault that met 
the legal definition of rape the researchers use considered the 
incident to be rape. Students 
are particularly unlikely to label the incident as
 ﬁrapeﬂ when no weapon is used, no sign of 
physical injury is evident, and alcohol is involved (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000). Victims 
may not define the event as sexual assault 
or report the incide
nt because they are embarrassed, are reluctant to consider some
one they know as a rapist, or do not 
understand the legal definition of sexual assault (Pitts & Schwartz, 1993). Victimization 

characteristics have indeed been associated
 with the likelihood of reporting sexual 
victimization. In the NCWSV, the severity of the incident (i.e., use of weapons, victim 
definition of the incident as rape) as associ
ated with greater likelihood of reporting. In 
addition, threats of sexu
al victimization and rapes were mo
re likely to be reported than 
sexual contact and sexual 
coercion (Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, & Turner, 2003). 
Characteristics of the offender and victim have also been shown to influence the likelihood 
of reporting among university women. Incidents most likely to be reported to law 
enforcement are those in which 
the offender was a stranger and in which the victim and 
offender did not share the same race/ethnici
ty (Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, & Turner, 2003). 
Regarding victim characteristics, African American victims we
re more likely to report incidents than students of other races/ethnicities (Fishe
r, Daigle, Cullen, & Turner, 2003). 
Several contextual characteristics are associated with the likelihood of reporting. For 
example, incidents occurring on campus were mo
re likely to be report
ed to law enforcement 
(specifically, campus 
police) than off-campus incident
s in the NCWSV (Fisher, Daigle, 
Cullen, & Turner, 2003).  
A major contextual factor that influences the likelihood of reporting is the role of alcohol and 
drugs. In the NCWSV, incidents in which both
 offenders and victims 
were drinking or had 
taken drugs were less likely to be reported to campus authorities (Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, & 
Turner, 2003). Although we are aware of no pr
evious studies that have examined reporting 
for incapacitated sexual assaul
t or subtypes such as DFSA, 
one would expect even lower 
reporting of DFSA because of the possibility th
at the victim has trouble recalling specific 
events or may know that the drug may be un
detectable soon after ingestion (Ledray, 2000; 
Riveira & Hart, 2000).  
Sexual assault victims in general, however, are likely to tell someone they know about their 
victimization experiences. The NCWSV found 
that victims told someone other than the 
police (most often friends) about their victimization in approximately 70% of the incidents 
(Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, & Turner, 2003)

penile-anal, digital-vaginal, digital-anal, object-vaginal, and object-anal.ﬂ

 Section 2 Š Background 2.5 Perpetration of Campus Sexual Assault 
A few studies have attempted to seek further understanding of the i
ssue of campus sexual 
assault by collecting 
reports of sexual coercion and se
xual assault perpetration among 
college men. For example, Koss, Gidycz, and 
Wisniewski (1987) found that nearly 20% of 
college-aged males reported obtaining some ty
pe of sexual contact 
through coercion, with 
1% reporting perpetration of oral or anal penetration throug
h the use of physical force. 
Based on a small convenience sample of unive
rsity men, Tyler, Hoyt, and Whitbeck (1998) 
found that 3% of male respondents reported using physical force to obtain sexual 
intercourse and 23% used alcohol or drugs to 
obtain sexual intercourseŠprevalence rates 
that were surprisingly similar to the victimization rates reported by the women in their 
sample.  Several studies have identified risk factors fo
r perpetration, based on 
both victim accounts of the sexual assault and self-reported information from men. No
t surprisingly, a risk factor 
for perpetration of sexual assault is substance use. Men who reported heavy drinking are 
more likely than other men to
 report having committed sexu
al assault (Abbey et al., 1994; 
Koss & Dinero, 1988). In the National College Women™s Study, in 
which 74% of rape 
perpetrators had been drinking alcohol prior to 
the assault, drinking prior to the assault by 
the perpetrator was also associated with the severity of the sexual victimization (Ullman, 
Karabatsos, & Koss, 1999).  
As mentioned previously, fraternity men have been identified as being more likely to 
perpetrate sexual assault or 
sexual aggression than nonf
raternity men (Tyler, Hoyt, & 
Whitbeck, 1998; Lackie & deMan, 1997). In 
addition, a recent study by Forbes, Adams-
Curtis, Pakalka, and White (2006) found th
at college men who had participated in 
aggressive sports (including football, basketball
, wrestling, and soccer) in high school used 
more sexual coercion (along with physical and psychological aggression) in their college 
dating relationships than men who had not. Th
is group also scored hi
gher on attitudinal 
measures thought to be associated with sexu
al coercion, such as 
sexism, acceptance of 
violence, hostility toward women, and rape
 myth acceptance (Forbes, Adams-Curtis, 
Pakalka, & White, 2006). 
In the general population, sexual assault perpetra
tors have been identified as having higher 
levels of hostility toward women; lower levels of empathy; and being more likely to hold 

traditional gender role stereotypes, endorse 
statements used to ju
stify rape, and hold 
adversarial beliefs about relationships be
tween men and women (Seto & Barbaree, 1997). 
In addition, they are more likely to have ex
perienced abuse or viol
ence as a child, have 
engaged in adolescent delinquency, have p
eers who view forced sex as acceptable, and 
have had early and frequent 
dating and sexual experiences (Seto & Barbaree, 1997).

   3. RESEARCH METHODS In recent years, incide
nts of drug facilitated 
sexual assault, in particular, have received 
considerable media attention; however, empiri
cal information concerning these events is limited. The research that does exist suggests that university students are a group that may 
be at high risk of ex
periencing sexual assault, especially drug-facilitated assaults. It is 
therefore important to conduct methodologically
 sound research and collect valid data on 
sexual assault, including drug-facilitated sexual assault, in an effort to establish a firm 
foundation on which to develop effective preven
tive and therapeutic re
sponse strategies, as 
well as legal interventions.  
The CSA Study involved conducting a We
b-based survey of random samples of 
undergraduate students at two large public univ
ersities, one located in the South (University 
1) and one located in the Midwest (University 2). Both universities are located in semi-urban 
areas. University 1 has a student body of a
pproximately 30,000 students; University 2 has 
approximately 35,000 students. Approximately 10% 
of students at Univ
ersity 1 are African 
American and 3% are Hispanic. About 11% of st
udents at University 2 are African American 
and 2% are Hispanic. Fifty-eight percent of 
students are University 1 are women and 55% 
of students are University 2 are women.  
The CSA Survey was administered in the 
winter of 2005Œ2006, and a total of 5,446 
undergraduate women and 1,375 undergradu
ate men participated. The CSA Study was 
reviewed and approved by RTI™s Institutional Re
view Board (IRB), as well as the university 
IRBs. The remainder of this section of the final report presents information about the 
sampling and data collection methodology and th
e data analysis plan. 
Subsequent sections 
present descriptive data on the CSA survey re
spondents, the results 
of the CSA Study, and 
a discussion of the CSA Stud
y conclusions, recommendatio
ns, and future research 
directions.  3.1 Data Collection 
Two large public universities participated in 
the CSA Study. Both universities provided us 
with data files containing the following information on all undergraduate students who were 
enrolled in the fall of 2005: full name, gender, race/ethnicity, date of birth, year of study, 
grade point average, full-time/
part-time status, e-mail addre
ss, and mailing address. In 
developing the sampling frame, we excluded st
udents who were not enrolled full- or three-
quarters time or who were over the age of 
25 (because of concerns about not having 
sufficient statistical power to generate stab
le prevalence rates for the small number of students falling into these subgroups and the likelihood that these students, by having a 
longer duration of university attendance, woul
d have an increased ch
ance for exposure to sexual assault that is unrelated to their status as university students). Students under the 
age of 18 were also excluded to avoid having to obtain parental consent for the survey. The 
3-1  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
total sampling frame from University 1 incl
uded 15,661 students (9,151 women and 6,510 
men7), and the sampling frame from University
 2 included 14,875 students (7,011 women 
and 7,864 men).  
3.1.1 Sampling 
We created four sampling subframes, with ca
ses randomly ordered within each subframe: 
University 1 women, University 1 men, Universi
ty 2 women, and University 2 men. We then 
slightly reduced the size of the subframes (u
sing random sampling procedures) to obtain 
equal numbers of freshmen, sophomores, j
uniors, and seniors. The reduced sampling 
subframes at University 1 and University 
2 contained 14,804 students (8,912 women and 
5,892 men) and 11,960 students (6,324 women 
and 5,636 men), respectivelyŠa total of 
26,764 students across the four subf
rames at the two universities.  Samples were then drawn randomly from each 
of the four subframes. The sizes of these 
samples were dictated by response rate pro
jections and sample size targets (4,000 women 
and 1,000 men, evenly distributed across th
e universities and years of study). For the 
female subsamples, 7,200 women were ultimately sampled 
from University 1 and 5,636 
women were ultimately sampled from
 University 2 (see Exhibit 3-1).  
3.1.2 Recruitment Procedures and Response Rates 
To recruit the students who were sampled to participate in the CSA Study, we relied on both 
recruitment e-mails and hard 
copy recruitment letters that
 were mailed to potential 
respondents. Sampled students were sent an initial recruitment e-mail that described the 
study, provided each student 
with a unique CSA Study ID#, and included a hyperlink to the 
CSA Study Web site. During each of the followi
ng 2 weeks, students who had not completed 
the survey were sent a follow-up e-mail encour
aging them to particip
ate. The third week, nonrespondents were mailed a hard-copy recr
uitment letter. Two weeks after the hard-copy 
letters were mailed, nonrespondents were se
nt a final recruitment e-mail. The overall 
response rates for survey completion for the undergraduate women sampled at the two 
universities were 42.2% and 42.8
%, respectively. The response 
rates for males were lower. 
Exhibit 3-1 depicts the 
response rates in relation to th
e sampling frames and subframes. 
Procedures for addressing response bias are di
scussed in more detail in the analysis section. 
3.1.3 Web Site and Survey Design and Content 
We reviewed the extant literat
ure on survey design and specifically Web-based survey 
design and structured the CSA survey accordin
gly. For example, we kept the extent to 
which respondents had to scroll on a given We
b page to a minimum,
 we made the font 
sufficiently large, and we used question struct
ures that are familiar and straightforward to                                          
 7The inclusion of males was an exploratory component of the CSA Study, so many fewer male 
respondents were sampled.

college students.  Although we 
would have liked to collect data
 on more topics or in more 
detail, we believed it was necessary to keep 
the survey instrument as concise as possible.

 The survey instrument was programmed to accommodate a significant degree of 
customization based on responses to specific
 questions (e.g., gender
-specific programming, skip patterns based on responses to ﬁgateﬂ questions, and fill patterns reflecting an 
individual™s responses to previous questions). The survey was 
designed to be completed in 
approximately 20 minutes, on average; however, large portions
 of the survey only applied 
to students who answered affirmatively to any of the sexual assault ga
te questions. Because of the voluntary nature of the survey, students were not forced to enter a response to each 

question prior to moving through the survey
. However, for key survey questions, the 
instrument was programmed to display a messa
ge encouraging a response if the student 
did not answer the question before advancing to the next question.  
The survey was divided into six modules. 
Background Information
 included survey items on demographics, school classifi
cation (year of study, year of enrollment, transfer status), 
residential characteristics, academic performance (GPA, ever failed a course), sports and social involvement (sports team membership
, social organization membership, party 
attendance), attendance at f
unctions where alcohol is served
, and attitudes toward one™s 
university. 
Alcohol and Other Drug Use
 included items regarding frequency of alcohol and 
drug consumption (data on 13 different classes of drugs were obtained) since entering 

college, frequency of binge drinking and getting drunk, risk behavi
ors associated with 
3-3  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
unknown drug ingestion (accepting a drink from someone unknown, leaving a drink 
unattended), experiences (suspected and/or known) with unknown drug ingestion (a series 
of questions were asked about both giving a drug to someone without their 
knowledge/consent and being given a drug
 without one™s know
ledge/consent), and 
availability of alcohol and other drugs. 
Dating
 included items on sexual orientation, 
frequency of dating, frequency of consensual 
sexual intercourse, AOD consumption prior to 
sexual intercourse, and dating violence (quest
ions were asked about both victimization and 
perpetration of emotional and physical abuse).  
The information on sexual assault victimization was included in the 
Experiences 
module, which was developed after extensive review
s of past surveys 
of sexual assault.
8  This 
module included a series of gate questions fo
r numerous types of nonconsensual sexual 
contact experienced by the vict
im. Distinct gate questions were asked for the following 
types of nonconsensual sexual contact, both 
before and since entering college: verbally coerced sexual contact (both completed and atte
mpted incidents), physically forced sexual 
assault (both completed and attempted incidents), and sexual assaul
t occurring when the 
respondent was incapacitated (respondents we
re asked about incidents they were certain 
happened and incidents they su
spected happened). Detailed fo
llow-up questions were asked 
of respondents who reported experiencing 
since they began college attempted and/or 
completed physically forced sexual assault an
d/or known and/or suspected sexual assault 
occurring when the respondent was incapaci
tated. The follow-up questions were asked 
separately for these two general types of sexual assault and included items on the number 
of incidents9; the specific type of assault(s) that
 occurred (forced touc
hing of a sexual 
nature, oral sex, sexual interc
ourse, anal sex, and/or sexual
 penetration with a finger or 
object); the number of perpetrators; the re
lationship between the victim and the 
perpetrator(s); characteristics of the perpetrator(s); AOD use by the perpetrator(s); AOD 
use by the victim; the location 
of the incident(s); the timing of
 the incident(s); the use of 
weapons by the perpetrator(s); injuries sust
ained in the incident(s
); disclosure about the 
incident(s) to family/friends, victim™s crisis
/health care centers, and law enforcement; 
timing of reporting to victim™s crisis/health care centers and law enforcement; physical 

examinations/drug tests received; drug(s) tested 
positive for; satisfaction with reporting; 
reasons for not reporting the in
cident(s); other actions (both 
personal and academic) taken 
as a result of the incident(s); legal consequences experienced by the perpetrator; and 

whether the respondent considered the incident to be rape. Although the survey was 
                                         
 8Previous studies reviewed included, but were no
t limited to, the National College Women Survey 
(Koss et al. 1987), the College Alcohol Study (Mohler-Kuo et al., 2004), the National Violence 
Against Women Survey (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2000), and the National College Women Sexual 
Victimization Survey (Fisher et al. 2000). 
9The ﬁnumber of incidentsﬂ question was used to 
customize the wording for the remaining follow-up 
questions. For respondents who had reported experiencing more than one incident of the specific 
type of sexual assault, the follow-up questions pr
imarily asked about ﬁany of the incidents.ﬂ This 
option was chosen over asking the victims to focus on a specific incident because we were primarily 
interested in the totality of each victim™s experiences rather than characteristics of a single incident.  
3-4  Section 3 Š Research Methods 
predominantly closed-ended, vi
ctims were also given the opportunity to write in (in a 
narrative fashion) any additional information 
about the incident(s) that they wanted to 
share. The Experiences
 section received by male respondents had the same level of detail 
and content, but it was tailored to be gender-appropriate. 
For male respondents, a section that paralleled the ﬁExperiencesﬂ module was then covered. 
This module, 
Behaviors, asked about the perpetration of 
the same types of sexual assault 
covered in the victimization module. Respondents who answered affirmatively to the gate 
questions were asked a set of follow-up question
s about the number of 
victims, the specific type of assault(s) that occurre
d, relationship to the victim, AOD use by the perpetrator, 
AOD use by the victim, weapon use, injuries sustained, and whether the respondent 
considered the incident(s) to be rape.  
The final module of the survey covered attitu
des about sexual assaul
t (respondents were 
given seven scenarios and asked 
to classify them as rape) an
d attitudes about the survey 
(the degree of honesty they employed when 
answering the survey qu
estions). In addition, 
the final module of the su
rvey included a question designed to enable an 
aggregate-level prevalence estimate of physically forced sexual assault to be ge
nerated among the study 
participants. Using an ﬁitem countﬂ technique, 
survey respondents were randomly assigned 
to respond to one of two ques
tions in which a list of adverse events is provided and the 
respondents simply report the number of th
e events they have experienced (without 
indicating which events they 
have experienced). One list incl
uded the key event (ﬁSomeone 
has had sexual contact with you by using phys
ical force or threatening to physically harm 
youﬂ) and the other did not, enabling a preval
ence estimate to be generated simply by 
subtracting the average number 
of events experienced by 
the group whose list did not 
include the key event from th
e average number of events ex
perienced by the group whose list did include the key event. 
After the last survey question was answered, respon
dents were presented with an 
informational module on sexual assault and DFSA (as mentioned previously, a link to this 
informational module was also included on the home page of the survey). The informational 

module included sexual assault definitions, prevention advice, legal consequences of giving 
someone a drug without their kn
owledge or consent, and signs 
of drug ingestion. Also, on 
each page of the survey, we included a link to 
local, state, and nation
al resources for sexual assault victims.  3.1.4 Incentive Redemption 
The instrument was programmed to generate a 
ﬁsurvey completion codeﬂ immediately after 
the respondent scrolled through the informational module. The students were then directed 
to a separate Web site (which opened up in a new window) to obtain their incentive for 
completing the survey. At this Web site, the students entered their ﬁCSA Study ID#ﬂ and 
their ﬁsurvey completion code.ﬂ
 The Web site was programmed 
to ensure that the ID and 
3-5  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
the code were valid (and had not been previously used to obtain an incentive) prior to 
issuing a $10 gift certificate code for Amazon.com and an iTunes song download. When an 
incentive was issued, the sample member was id
entified as having re
ceived an incentive, 
but no link between the identity of a sample
 member and their survey data was ever 
created. This incentive redemption strategy fulfilled three major objectives: (1) maintaining 
the anonymity of the survey data, (2) allowing us to track survey completion (so that we 
could follow up with noncompleters, generate
 response rate estimates, and compare the 
final respondents with the sampling frame), an
d (3) ensuring that each respondent could 
only receive one incentive and that only the st
udents sampled for the survey would be able 
to receive the incentive.
10  Because the survey was administ
ered anonymously, we were not able to determine with 
certainty which students in the sampling frame participated in the CSA Study and which did 
not. The only way for us to determine with certainty which sampling frame members 
participated was if they redeemed the incent
ive we offered to students (an iTunes song 
download and a $10 Amazon.com gift certificate), and not all students who participated in 
the CSA Study redeemed their 
incentives. In fact, about 84
% of students who completed 
the CSA survey followed through to obtain thei
r incentives. Similarly,
 the identities of 
sampling frame members were not attached to the survey data, so nonresponse bias 

analyses and data weighting procedures that we
 would typically employ
 in a study of this 
kind are not possible. Although this is a limitation of the CSA Study, we believe that 
maintaining anonymity and being able to credibly claim anonymity to potential survey 
participants was critical to the quality of th
e data and the success of the study, especially 
give the sensitive nature 
of the survey questions. 3.2 Data Handling 
3.2.1 Data Preparation and Cleaning 
Throughout the 3-month period in which 
the survey was administered, data were 
automatically saved to a data file on a secu
re network. Data were reviewed weekly to 
ensure that the survey inst
rument was working properly. Several minor problems were 
identified that preclude us from being able 
to use the data from some items, but these 
items were not critical to the purp
ose or the success of the CSA Study. 
As with any survey data, some cleaning of the CSA data was required; however, the nature 
and extent of the cleaning that
 was necessary was limited. We 
have extant data on timing 
(i.e., how long it took each respondent to answer a particular question or complete the 
survey). We tested the survey instrument extensively and determined how quickly 
respondents could credibly move through the survey, as well as how long it might take 
                                         
 10However, we cannot rule out the (very unlikely) possibility that some individuals sampled for the 
survey provided their study identification num
ber to a student not sampled for the survey. 
3-6  Section 3 Š Research Methods 
students who were moving through the instrument slowly or who skipped into the detailed 
sections of the instrument, which would increa
se administration time. We were aware that 
some students might move through the survey as quickly as possible without reading the 
questions or response options or
 giving any thought to their answers in an effort to just 
obtain the incentives we were offering 
(i.e., an iTunes song download and a $10 
Amazon.com gift). We decided in advance of launching the survey that if respondents 

moved through the survey so quickly that they 
could not have credibly read some or most 
of the survey questions, we would discard th
eir data. The range of survey administration 
times was 1.65 minutes to 102.67 minutes (mean = 12.32 minutes, standard deviation = 

6.88 minutes). Our testing indicated that even the fastest of respondents could not credibly 

participate in the CSA Study in less than 6 minutes, a value that is a little less than 1 
standard deviation below the mean, a threshol
d that is sometimes used to identify and 
discard outlying data. We, ther
efore, decided to discard data from respondents who moved 
through the survey in under 5.44 minutes, which is outside of 1 standard deviation from the 

mean and resulted in us discarding 148 stud
ent responses. Given the large number of 
respondents, discarding this many
 cases changed the results of 
the CSA Study very little, if 
at all. Additional data cleaning simply involved recording data into more reasonable or preexisting 

categories. For example, on a number of su
rvey items, we provided respondents with 
response options, but we also let them choose 
an ﬁotherﬂ category and type in information 
that we received in the form of verbatim data. 
The race question is one in which this option 
was afforded to survey responde
nts, and although some of the verbatim data are difficult to 
recode into the preexisting categories (e.g., ﬁAmerican), other answers could be easily 
recoded (e.g., ﬁChineseﬂ into
 ﬁAsianﬂ). We recoded data whenever doing so was 
straightforward. In situations in which recodi
ng was not straightforward, we usually simply 
left those responses in a catc
hall category like ﬁother.ﬂ  
3.2.2 Response Bias Analyses 
Given the relatively low response rate achieved
 in the CSA Study, several strategies were 
employed to identify and adjust for the impa
ct of nonresponse. Although some studies 
designed to capture sensitive information 
among university students have conducted 
intensive nonrespondent analyses and found no evidence that nonresponse affects the 
prevalence estimate (for example, in the Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol 
Study, an association between student nonresponse and binge-drinking rates was not 
observed [Wechsler, Lee, Kuo, 
& Lee, 2000]), it is logical to 
surmise that students who did 
not participate in a survey about sexual assault may differ from those who did participate,
11                                          
 11However, the reasons for nonresponse could affect prevalence estimates in opposing ways. Some 
nonrespondents (nonvictims) may have chosen not to participate because they felt that they had 
no relevant experience, whereas other respondent
s (victims) may have chosen not to participate 
because they anticipated that taking the survey might be upsetting to them.  
3-7  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
which raises concerns about the accuracy 
of prevalence estimates generated from 
respondents. The first step in addressing nonresponse was to conduct a unit nonresponse bias analysis, in 
which we compared respondents and nonrespond
ents on the administra
tive data elements provided by the universities. Th
ese data elements included ag
e, university, race/ethnicity, 
and year of study. The results indicated that
 some bias existed, particularly in the 

race/ethnicity category. Nonwhite students (i
.e., those identified as black, Hispanic, or 
other) were less likely to respond to the surv
ey than their white counterparts. To reduce 
nonresponse bias and increase sample re
presentativeness, weights adjusting for 
nonresponse were developed using a General
ized Exponential Model (Folsom & Singh, 
2000). Cohen™s effect size (CES) 
(Cohen, 1988, Section 7.2) was used as a measure of the 
magnitude of the bias, and we added weights for university, gender, year of study, and 

race/ethnicity, which reduced bias to negligible levels. For example, the CES for the 
race/ethnicity measure was 0.614 prior to weighting, which reflects a considerable amount 

of bias (Cohen, 1988). After we
ighting, the CES for race/ethnicity was reduced to 0.169, 
reflecting a small amount of bias. All preval
ence estimates are based on weighted data; 
however, for ease of presentati
on, unweighted sample sizes are displayed in all text, tables 
and figures. 
In an effort to learn more about the leve
l and impact of nonresponse bias, we also 
examined the data using a ﬁcontinuum of 
resistanceﬂ model (Groves & Wissoker, 1999; Curtin, Presser, & Singer, 2000). This model is 
based on the notion that the propensity to 
respond to a survey can be viewed as a co
ntinuum and that amon
g individuals who do respond to the survey, their prop
ensity to respond is at least partially associated with how 
long it took them (in the recruitment proces
s) to take the survey
. Therefore, one can 
examine differences between ﬁe
arly respondersﬂ and ﬁlate respondersﬂ and infer that the 
pattern for late responders can be applied to
 or represent nonrespondents, because late 
responders and nonrespondents are both on 
the far end of the propensity to respond 
continuum. Another way of thinking about this issue is that late responders would have 
likely been nonrespondents if we had not followed up with nonrespondents as many times 
as we did or had shut down the Web survey 
early (note that the re
cruitment materials did 
not specify the end date of the 
survey, so sampled students di
d not know when it would be 
closed). Although this technique is not used 
to adjust any data, it enables us to compare 
early and late responders in an effort 
to learn something about nonrespondents. 
We divided our sample of 5,446 women respondents into quintiles in terms of when in the 
recruitment process they responded. The firs
t 20% who responded (n = 1,089) were in 
quintile 1, the second 20% who responded (n = 1,089) were in quintile 2, etc. We then 
compared the data from women in each of
 the five quintiles to determine whether 
respondents in each of the qu
intiles differed from each other on 17 measures, including 
race/ethnicity, age, year of study, alcohol use, marijuana use, illicit drug use, and a variety 
3-8  Section 3 Š Research Methods 
of measures on sexual assault 
victimization. We also collap
sed the quintiles to represent 
early responders (i.e., respon
dents in quintiles 1 and 2) 
and late responders (i.e., 
respondents in quintiles 3, 4, and 5) and made
 the same comparisons, both in a bivariate 
and multivariate fashion (to control for the effects of potentially confounding variables). We 
used the unweighted data for this comparison. 
Both the bivariate and multivariate analyses 
demonstrated that the only variables for whic
h there was a significant difference based on 
either the five-category or two-category compar
ison were race/ethnicity and marijuana use. 
Black respondents were significantly more li
kely to be ﬁlate re
spondersﬂ than white respondents (67% vs. 59%), and students who 
reported any marijuana use since entering college were significantly more likely to be 
ﬁlate respondersﬂ than those who did not report 
marijuana use (62% vs. 59%). However, the differences, though statistically significant at 
the .05 level, were small.  
The continuum of resistance an
alysis, which indicates black students responded later in the 
recruitment process, is supported by our unit
 nonresponse analysis, which indicated that 
black students were less likely to respond than white students. Overall, our continuum of 
resistance analysis suggests that late responde
rs did not seem to be 
substantially different 
from early responders on a wide range of dime
nsions, most importantly on our measures of 
sexual assault. To the extent that nonrespond
ents are similar to late responders, one can 
speculate that the prevalence rates generated from th
e study are not biased by 
nonresponse.  
Additional support for this 
speculation was found in our third approach for examining 
nonresponse. We conducted a brief follow up su
rvey with a sample of
 the students who had 
not redeemed the incentive for the CSA survey 
(i.e., these students were assumed to be 
those who did not respond to the original surve
y). A total of 2,000 nonrespondents (limited 
to sophomores, juniors, and 
seniors due to the nonrespondent follow up survey being 
conducted in fall 2006Šthe academic year following
 the fielding of the original survey) were 
emailed an invitation to participate in a br
ief Web-based survey to determine why they 
chose not to participate in the original survey
. Of these, 296 responded to the survey. Once the students confirmed that
 they had indeed not part
icipated in the CSA survey
12, they were 
asked why they had not partic
ipated. Fourteen sample memb
ers stated that they never 
received the original recruitment e-mails, an
d 126 students (45%) were not sure whether 
they had received these e-mails. 
Interestingly, of those who ei
ther did not receive or were not sure whether they received the e-mails,
 71% said that they would have taken the 
survey if they had received them. Among th
e sample members who either did receive the 
e-mails and chose to not part
icipate or said that they 
would
 not
 have participated if they 
                                         
 12As mentioned previously, because the survey was anonymous the only indicator of participation was 
whether the student obtained an incentive code. We 
have no way to identify students who took the 
survey and did not obtain an incentive code. Eigh
ty-one of the ﬁnonrespondentsﬂ sampled for the 
nonrespondent follow-up survey reported that they in
deed participated in the original survey, either 
partially or completely.  
3-9  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
had received the e-mails, the most commonly 
reported reasons for no
nparticipation were 
that they did not have time (r
eported by about two-thirds of 
the sample members) or that 
they never participate in Web-based surveys 
(reported by just over 20% of the sample 
members). An extremely small number of th
e respondents to the nonrespondent survey 
indicated that they did not participate becaus
e they had never experi
enced sexual assault (n = 9, 15.0%), or because they did not want
 to discuss their expe
riences with sexual 
assault victimization (n = 4, 6.7%). 
Although these findings are constrained to the very small number of nonrespondents (to the 
original survey) who participated in the nonr
esponse follow-up survey, they are encouraging 
because they suggest that the reasons for not pa
rticipating in the CSA study are factors that 
are not associated with sexual assault. If nonresponse were associated with victimization 
(such that either nonvictims were less likely to participate because they felt that they 
survey was not relevant to them or that victims were less likely to participate because they 
did not feel comfortable report
ing their experiences), we woul
d be less confident that the 
relatively high nonresponse did not substantially bias the sexual assault prevalence 

estimates developed from the data. 
3.3 Data Analysis 
3.3.1 Descriptive Analyses 
We used a variety of descriptive analyses to 
familiarize ourselves with
 the data, assist in 
data cleaning and coding, and prepare for runni
ng multivariate models. We used frequency 
distributions, cross tabulations,
 bivariate correlations, partial 
correlations, chi-squares, and 
t-tests to review large amounts of data, recogn
ize patterns in the data, inform the recoding 
of some variables, inform the creation of 
derived variables, and plan for bivariate and 
multivariate analyses.  
In addition to helping us understand the 
data and plan for more advanced analyses, 
descriptive data were used
 extensively to describe 
 our survey respondents, 
 the victims and perpetrators of va
rious types of sexual assault,  
 the context and correlates of various types of sexual assault,  
 the consequences of various 
types of sexual assault, 
 the reporting and nonreporting of vari
ous types of sexual assault, and  
 the experiences of victims of vari
ous types of sexual assault.  
Generation of Prevalence Estimates 
Since one of the primary purposes
 of the CSA Study is to gene
rate prevalence estimates of distinct types of sexual assa
ult experienced by undergraduat
e students before and after 3-10 
 Section 3 Š Research Methods 
they entered college, a detailed discussion of the methods used 
to classify respondents into 
the relevant categories is warranted. The specific wording of all sexual assault victimization 
items used to categorize victims by assault type is included in Appendix A. The first level of 
classification pe
rtains to the 
nature of the sexual assault
. The two general types of 
sexual assault captured by th
e Web-based survey are physical
ly forced sexual assault and incapacitated sexual assault (i.e., sexual assault when 
the victim was incapacitated and 
unable to provide consent).13 As described previously, the 
survey asked about these two 
types of sexual assault separa
tely, with detailed follow-up qu
estions asked for each type.  The second level of cla
ssification pertains to whether the assault was completed
. For physically forced sexual assault, data on 
both completed and atte
mpted incidents were collected separately. Because recall of the event can be problematic fo
r incapacitated sexual assault, we asked separately about events 
the respondent was certain happened and those 
the respondent suspected happened. In this
 report, the incapacitated sexual assault 
measures only include sexual assaults 
that the victim was 
certain happened.  
The third level of classification pertains to incidents occurring 
before 
and since entering 
college. For both physically forced and incapacita
ted sexual assault, data on completed and 
attempted (or, for incapacitated sexual assaul
t, suspected) incident
s were collected to 
reflect two time periods, before
 and since entering college.  
A fourth level of classification pertains to the 
severity of the sexual assault
. For completed incidents of both types (physically fo
rced and incapacitated), we further classified sexual assault based on severity. Specifically
, we generated subtype 
prevalence estimates for sexual battery (i.e., sexual
 assault that entailed sexual touching only) and rape (i.e., 
sexual assault that entailed oral, vaginal, or 
anal penetration). This level of categorization 
was achieved using responses to the follow-up 
questions about the specific type of sexual 
contact that occurred (forced touching of a sexual
 nature, oral sex, sexu
al intercourse, anal 
sex, and/or sexual penetratio
n with a finger or object). 
Given that a key objective of the current stud
y was to contribute to the understanding of 
incapacitated sexual assault, a 
fifth level of classification 
was employed for incapacitated 
sexual assault to 
distinguish between 
AOD-enabled sexual assa
ult, DFSA, Suspected 
DFSA, and other incapacitated sexual assault
. Using follow-up questions asked of 
victims who reported experiencing sexual assault when they 
were incapacitated and unable 
to provide consent, we further break down inca
pacitated sexual assault into finer categories. 
Specifically, students who reported sexual as
sault when they were 
incapacitated and unable 
to provide consent were asked whether they ha
d been drinking alcohol or voluntarily been 
taking or using any drugs other than alcohol ju
st before the incident
 and whether they had 
been given a drug without thei
r knowledge or consent just be
fore the incident. Based on 
                                         
 13As mentioned previously, the survey also gathered 
information on verbally coerced, unwanted sexual 
contact; data on this form of unwanted sexual contact are not presented in this report.  
3-11 
 The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
these responses, we divided the victims into fo
ur subtypes: those who were victims of drug-
facilitated sexual assault (DFSA, i.e., they were sexu
ally assaulted when they were 
incapacitated after they had been given a dr
ug without their knowle
dge, and were certain 
about having been given a drug without th
eir knowledge), those 
who were victims of 
suspected drug-facilitated sexual assault (SDFSA, i.e., they were sexually assaulted while 
incapacitated and suspected they
 had been given a drug withou
t their consent prior to the 
assault), those who were victims of AOD-enable
d sexual assault (i.e., they were sexually 
assaulted when they were incapacitated after 
voluntarily consuming drugs or alcohol), and 
those who were sexually assaulted when they 
were otherwise incapacitated. If a student 
was a victim of both AOD-enabled sexual assaul
t and either DFSA or SDFSA, we classified 
her as a DFSA victim only. The 18 prevalence measures for sexual 
assault are summarized in Exhibit 3-2. All estimates presented in 
this report are based on weighted data.

 Section 3 Š Research Methods 
3.3.2 Risk Factors for Sexual Assault 
Bivariate Analyses 
We ran cross tabulations by 
four sexual assault measures and a comprehensive set of 
individual characteristics and be
havioral factors. Chi-squares we
re used to determine if the 
bivariate relationship between each sexual assault measure and each variable was 
statistically significant. These analyses helped us determine which variables should be 
considered for insertion into multivariate models.  
Multivariate Analyses 
We used binary logistic regression to analyze the CSA data in a multivariate framework. In 
the exploratory phase of our analyses, we us
ed forward and backward stepwise selection 
procedures to assess the relationships between an array of variables of interest and sexual 
assault outcomes. Reviewing these models helped us determ
ine whether certain variables 
needed to be recoded for, removed from, or 
added to the multivariate models. Development 
of the final models (presented in the Findings section of this report) was informed by these 

procedures as well as the existing
 literature. Variables that we felt were important to control 
for (e.g., race/ethnicity), are 
also included in the models.  
Beyond the types of analyses we
 conducted to generate the CSA Study findings, it is worth 
discussing the purpose of the ana
lyses or the overall goals of the multivariate analysis plan. 
Generally, the CSA Study was designed to gene
rate data on the prevalence, nature, and 
reporting of various types of sexual assault. More specifically, the CSA Study was intended 

to  document the prevalence of various types of sexual assault on university campuses; 
 describe incidents, victims, and perpetrato
rs of various types of sexual assault;  identify risk and protective factors for, as
 well as consequences of, various types of 
sexual assault; 
 describe the reporting and nonreporting of
 various types of se
xual assault; and  document attitudes about variou
s types of sexual assault. 
To achieve these goals, numerou
s measures that could be asso
ciated with various types of 
sexual assault were crea
ted and prepared for use in logistic regression models of various sexual assault outcomes. The independent an
d dependent variables considered and used 
are discussed below. 
Dependent Variables.
 The CSA Study collected inform
ation about women™s experiences 
with physically forced and incapacitated sexual 
assault. Within incapaci
tated sexual assault, we are able to distinguish between incapacita
tion achieved by the 
perpetrator giving the victim a drug without her knowledge or consent (
DFSA and SDFSA
) or the victim voluntarily 
consuming alcohol and/or other drugs (
AOD-enabled sexual assault
). Since the large 
3-13 
 The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
majority of incapacitated sexu
al assaults occurred after the victim voluntarily consumed 
alcohol or drugs (of the 651 women who experien
ced an incapacitated sexual assault, 86% 
were classified as having ex
perienced AOD-enabled assault), 
the multivariate analyses are 
limited to victims of AOD-
enabled sexual assault.  The survey design allowed a responde
nt to report being a victim of 
both
 forced sexual 
assault and AOD-enabled sexual
 assault. Almost two percent of the sample (n = 101) 
reported both types of sexual assault. Prelim
inary analyses indicated that this group was 
significantly different from the women who expe
rienced forced sexual assault only and from 
the respondents who experienced AOD-enabled sexual assa
ult only; therefore, the 
multivariate models include three mutually exclusive categories of sexual assault: (1) being 
a victim of forced sexual assault only, (2) being a victim of a completed AOD-enabled sexual 

assault only, and (3) being a victim of 
both forced and AOD-enabled 
sexual assault, in an effort to identify risk fa
ctors associated with each form of sexual assault.
 Physically forced 
sexual assault
 includes assaults occurring when the 
victim was forced or threatened with 
force into sexual contact. 
AOD-enabled sexual assault 
is a subset of incapacitated assaults 
(assaults occurring when a victim is unable to provide consent or stop what is happening 

because she is passed out, drugged, drunk, inca
pacitated or asleep), in which the victim™s 
incapacitation was due to voluntary consumptio
n of alcohol and/or other drugs. All models 
are limited to 
completed assaults that occurre
d since the women entered college
.  All sexual assault outcomes are binary coded 
(0 = no, 1 = yes), with women who were not 
victims of any form of completed sexual assaul
t in the reference category. In the CSA study, 
sexual assault includes rape (assa
ults involving oral, vaginal or anal sex, or vaginal or anal 
penetration with a finger or object) and sexual battery (assaults involving sexual contact 

only, such as forced kissing or fondling). The 
decision to present the results for the more 
inclusive category of sexual assault was base
d on supplementary anal
yses conducted for the subsets of rape victims. The results from thes
e analyses did not differ from those based on 
the more inclusive measures of 
sexual assault, which indicates 
that the inclusion of sexual 
battery in the dependent variable does not subs
tantially affect or alter the relationships of 
interest (results not shown). It is noteworthy
 that the majority of all sexual assaults 
involved oral, vaginal, or anal penetration and thus met the legal definition of rape in most 

states. The CSA Study collected data on verba
lly coerced sexual assaults; however, since 
those incidents typically do not meet the legal de
finition of sexual assault, data on them are 
not presented in the current report.  
Independent Variables.
 A comprehensive set of individual
 characteristics and behavioral factors were used in the logistic regression
 models as independent variables and/or to 
describe the sample. The number of years th
e respondent has been in college is a 
continuous variable ranging from 1 to 10. 
Race/ethnicity is dummy
 coded into black, 
Hispanic, and other, with wh
ite as the reference catego
ry. College experiences are 
measured by grade point average (GPA) (categorical), whether the respondent has ever 
3-14 
 Section 3 Š Research Methods 
failed a course, and whether the respondent is a member of a Greek social organization. 
Frequency measures of attending fraternity 
parties; attending parties where alcohol was 
served; and going to bars, pubs or clubs are measured as 0 = never, 1 = less than once a 
month, and 2 = at least once a month.  
There are several indicators of substance use.
 Use is dummy coded for marijuana and illicit 
substances, a collapsed measure of ever using at least 1 of 12 illicit substances other than 
marijuana. The frequency with which a responde
nt has been drunk since entering college is 
coded never, less than once a month, and at 
least once a month. Respondents were also 
asked if they suspected or knew they had ever been given a drug 
without their knowledge 
or consent since they entered college.  
Dating and sexual history are measured by num
ber of dating partners and sexual partners 
since entering college (categorical). Married respondents (n
 = 151) were not asked their 
number of dating partners; however, to conser
ve cases for analyses, they were coded 0 on 
this indicator. Frequency measures of being dr
unk or high during sex are coded as never, 
less than once a month, or more
 than once a month. Dating violence is measured as ever 
feeling threatened, humiliated, or controlled by 
a dating partner and ever
 being hit, slapped, kicked, or physically hurt by a dating partner (1 = yes, 0 = no). Past sexual victimization is 
measured as forced sexual assault and sexual
 assault when incapaci
tated before college 
(1 = yes, 0 = no). Exhibit 4, which appears 
in the next section of the report, presents 
additional sample descriptors not used in or
 dropped from the regression analyses. To 
control for unmeasured heterogeneity between 
universities, a dummy variable for school 
was included in analyses. 
3-15 
   4. STUDY SAMPLE 4.1 Women Descriptive data on the women in our sample 
are presented in Exhibit 4-1. As the data 
indicate, the majority of the women are white, 
although a sizeable proportion of them are 
black or in the other race category, which includes women who selected more than one 
racial/ethnic category, as well as Asians, Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders, and 
American Indians/Alaska Natives. Only 3.0% of the sample reported being Hispanic. Most of 

the women reported being hete
rosexual (95.6%). The majority of the sample is 20 or 
younger, and there are larger percentages of 
freshman and seniors in the sample than 
sophomores and juniors, which reflects the di
stribution at the participating universities 
(since the data are weighted for year of study).  
Almost 15% of women belong to
 a sorority, and 26.3% reported attending fraternity parties 
at least once a month, whereas 63% reported 
attending parties where alcohol is served and 
44.4% reported going to pubs, bars, or clubs at
 least once a month. Most of the sample had 
had at least one dating partner and at least on
e sexual partner since 
entering college. With 
regard to substance use, 85.9% reported using alcohol, 33.9% reported using marijuana, 

and 8.6% reported using an illicit drug (other 
than marijuana) since en
tering college. Forty-four percent reported getting drunk at least on
ce a month. Since entering college, 28% had 
accepted a drink from a stranger (with 5.6% of the sample reporting accepting drinks from 

strangers at least once a month), and 13
% had consumed a drink after leaving it 
unattended (with 1.9% engaging in this behavior at least once a month). Over a quarter of 
the sample (26.3%) reported consuming alcoho
l or drugs before sex once a month since 
entering college, and 20.7% reported being drunk
 or high during sex at least once a month 
since entering college. When asked if they had been given a 
drug without their knowledge 
or consent since entering college, 5.3% of 
the women responded affi
rmatively. The drugs these women reported being given, in order of
 prevalence, were Rohy
pnol, GHB, cocaine, 
ecstasy, LSD, marijuana, and 
stimulants (data not shown). 
4.2 Men Exhibit 4-2 presents descr
iptive data on the male sample (n
 = 1,375). As seen in the female 
sample, the majority of males are white, but a smaller proportion of males are black , 
Hispanic, or in the other race category. Most
 of the men reported being heterosexual and 
was 20 years old or younger, and the larg
est percentage is freshmen (27.0%).  Approximately 21% of the men belong to a sports team, 15.8% belong to a fraternity, and 

44.9% reported attending fraternity parties at
 least once a month (compared with 26.3% of 
females). About 70% reported attending parties where alcohol is served, and 45% reported 
going to pubs, bars, or clubs at least once a 
month, respectively. Most of the sample has 
had at least one dating partner and at least on
e sexual partner since 
entering college. With

 4-5    5. FINDINGS 5.1 Sexual Assault Victimization 
5.1.1 Prevalence Estimates 
Women 
Prevalence estimates for undergraduate women and the 18 measures of sexual assault are 
presented in Exhibit 5-1. Ea
ch prevalence estimate has 
a number in parentheses that 
corresponds to the descriptive list of estimate
s presented in Exhibit 3-
2. The first and most 
inclusive set of measures we
 present are the number and 
percentage of undergraduate 
women who reported being a victim of attempte
d or completed sexual 
assault of any type 
before entering college (1) (n = 819, 15.9%
) and since entering college (6) (n = 1,073, 
19.0%). The next set of prevalence estimates breaks down attempted and completed 

assaults for each time period. As shown in th
e figure, the prevalence of completed sexual 
assault is slightly higher than that of attempted
14 sexual assault for incidents occurring both 
before (2 and 3) and after (7 and 8) entering 
college. The data are not shown, but 5.5% of 
undergraduate women (when limited to expe
riences before college) and 7.2% of 
undergraduate women (when limited to expe
riences since entering college) reported 
experiencing both attempted and completed sexual assault.  
The third set of prevalence estimates rates ar
e breakdowns of completed sexual assault by 
time period for the two primary types of assault 
included in this study (physically forced vs. 
incapacitated sexual assault)
. When examining this set of
 prevalence estimates, an 
interesting pattern is evident. The prevalence of physically forced sexual assault was 

roughly equivalent for the time 
period reflecting experiences since entering college (9) and 
those occurring before entering college (4) (4
.7% vs. 6.4%, respective
ly). In contrast, the 
prevalence of sexual assault occurring when the victim was incapacitated is higher for the 

time period reflecting 
experiences since entering college (12) than before entering college 
(5) (11.1% vs. 7.0%, respectively). Exhibit 5-2 is a graphical depiction of the pattern of 
differential risk for the two main types of sexu
al assault by time pe
riod. The pattern shown 
in Exhibit 7 suggests that, amon
g undergraduate college women,
 the risk of experiencing sexual assault when they are in
capacitated is greater during college than the risk before 
entering college, whereas the risk of experiencing physically forced sexual assault is roughly 
similar (but slightly lower since entering college) in both time periods. A small number of 

women were victimized both before and since 
entering college. Sixty-eight women (1.4% of 
the sample) were victims of forced sexual as
sault both before and since entering college, 
and 140 women (2.5% of the sample) were vict
ims of incapacitated 
sexual assault both before and since entering college (data not shown). 
                                         
 14As mentioned previously, the measure of attempted sexual assault is restricted to incidents in which 
the assault was attempted 
but not completed. 5-1  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
Exhibit 5-1. Prevalence Estimates for th
e Sexual Assault Measures for Women, 
Unweighted Frequencies, Weighted Percentages  
  The fourth set of prevalence estimates show, 
for completed incidents 
since entering college, the number and percentage of university women 
experiencing sexual assaults of varying 
severity. Sexual battery was de
fined as sexual assault that entailed sexual touching only, 
and rape was defined as sexual 
assault that entailed oral, vagi
nal, or anal penetration. As shown in Exhibit 5-1, 3.
4% of women reported experiencing 
rape that was physically forced 
(11), 1.4% reported experienci
ng sexual battery (but not rape) that was physically forced 
(10), 8.5% of the sample reported experiencing rape while 
they were incapacitated and 
unable to provide consent (14), and 2.6% reported experienci
ng sexual battery (but not 
rape) while they were incapacitated and unable
 to provide consent (13). Exhibit 5-3 shows 
the breakdown of assault severity separately fo
r the two major types of sexual assault. The 
graphic depiction helps illustrate that roughl
y the same proportions 
of victims experience 
rape and sexual battery for the two 
major types of sexual assault.  
The final set of prevalence esti
mates included in Ex
hibit 5-1 further cla
ssify sexual assault occurring when the victim was 
incapacitated and unable to provide consent. Specifically, 
estimates are shown for AOD-enab
led sexual assault (i.e., assault that happened after the 
victim voluntarily consumed alcohol and/or drugs) (15), DFSA (drug-facilitated sexual 
assault) (16), SDFSA (suspected drug-facilitat
ed sexual assault) (17), and incidents that

which the victim was asleep) (18). A total of 466 women (7.8%) were victims of sexual 

assault that was AOD-enabled, 31 women (0.6
%) were victims of DFSA, 103 women (1.7%) 
were victims of SDFSA, and 48 women (1.0%) reported being sexually 
assaulted when they 
were otherwise incapacitated an
d unable to provide consent (i
.e., their incapacitation was not enabled by drugs or alcohol).  
The data presented in this section have shown the prevalence of
 various measures of sexual 
assault among university women in a ﬁsnapshotﬂ
 in time. Overall, 19% of undergraduate 
women reported experiencing attempted or comp
leted sexual assault si
nce entering college. However, half (52.7%) of our sample had experienced less than 2 years of college. This 
makes it difficult to predict a woman™s risk 
of sexual assault during her overall college 
career. Therefore, another way of looking at 
these data is to focus on seniors, who are 
theoretically in their last year of college. When
 subsetting to seniors, the data show that 
368 women (26.3% of seniors) reported expe
riencing attempted or completed sexual 
assault since entering co
llege, 6.9% of seniors were victims of physically forced sexual 
assault since entering 
college, and 16% of seniors were 
victims of incapacitated sexual 
assault since ente
ring college. 5-3  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study

  5-4  Section 5 Š Findings It is important to note, however, that alth
ough the cumulative pr
evalence estimates of sexual assault are understand
ably highest for seniors, th
e ﬁpast 12 monthﬂ prevalence 
estimates of sexual assault are highest among sophomores (data not shown).
15 This pattern 
indicates that women who are victimized during
 their college career are most likely to be 
victimized early during their college tenure. This finding is consistent with the literature, 
including a recent study employing a convenience sample of university women, which found 
that 84% of the women who reported sexua
lly coercive experiences experienced the incident during their first fo
ur semesters on campus (Gross
, Winslett, Roberts, & Gohm, 
2006).  Men Exhibit 5-4 illustrates prevalence estimates for the 18 measures of sexual assault among 
the undergraduate male sample 
(n = 1,375). Although the preval
ence of sexual assault is considerably lower among the male sample than the female sample, there are some 
estimates worth noting. Approximately 6.1% 
(n = 84) of males reported experiencing 
attempted or completed sexual assault since en
tering college (6). Half of them (n = 50, 
3.7%) experienced a 
completed sexual assault (8). Among 
victims of completed sexual 
assault since entering 
college, incapacitated sexual assa
ult was much more prevalent (12) 
(n = 45, 3.4%) than physically forced sexual assault (9) (n = 12, 0.7%). Only 0.7% of the 
male sample reported experiencing physically forced sexual assault (9) (n = 12). As was the 
case among the female undergraduate samp
le, a majority of the male victims of 
incapacitated sexual assault were classified as having experienced AOD-enabled sexual 
assault (i.e., assault that happened when th
e victim was incapacita
ted after voluntarily 
consuming alcohol and/or drugs); the prevalence
 for this type of assault among males was 
2.7% (15). Although male victims were asked all of the same follow-up questions as female 
victims, given that very few male victims of se
xual assault were identi
fied, we are not able to present any contextual or descriptive data 
on the sexual assault of males as we do for 
females below.                                          
 15Although the ﬁpast 12 monthﬂ prevalence is also 
high among freshmen, they were excluded from 
these comparisons of sexual assault prevalence 
because they had not experienced 12 months of 
college.

  5.1.2 Risk Factors Associated
 with Sexual Assault Among 
University Women Bivariate Results The purpose of this section of the final report is to identify risk and protective factors for 
various types of sexual assaul
t experienced by university wome
n. These analyses were not 
run for males because we had no plans of mode
ling sexual assault using the male sample 
given the relatively small sample size and low prevalence estimates. It is important to 

acknowledge that the cross-sect
ional nature of our data prevent a temporal understanding 
of the role of these factors in increasing (or decreasing) risk for sexual assa
ult. However, 
the data are useful in understanding subgroups
 of the university population that appear 
most likely to have experienced sexual assault. The information provides insight into the 
types of sexual assault undergrad
uate women are at greatest ri
sk of experiencing and what 
individual characteristics and be
havioral factors seemingly put them at risk for each type of 
sexual assault. The results can inform the de
velopment of prevention and risk reduction 
programming, campus policies, and crisis an
d law enforcement response strategies.  
5-6  Section 5 Š Findings We ran cross tabulations by four mutually ex
clusive outcomes experienced since entering 
college: physically forced sexual assault only, AOD-enabled sexual assault only, 
both physically forced and AOD-enab
led sexual assault, and no se
xual assault (nonvictims). Chi-
squares were used to determine if the bivari
ate relationship between each sexual assault 
measure and each variable was 
statistically significant. These analyses, which are shown in 
Exhibit 5-5, helped us determine which variables should be considered for insertion into 
multivariate models.  
Given the large sample size and the fact that 
the prevalence estimates for each measure of 
sexual assault are not negligible, it is not surprising that the majority of the bivariate 
analyses are statistically significant at the 0.05 level. As shown in Exhibit 5-5, the 
prevalence of sexual assault differs by 
a variety of demographic and behavioral 
characteristics. For the most part, students 
who appear at greater 
risk for experiencing sexual assault have an increased risk of all types of assault.
 However, distributions varied widely for some variables across sexual assault type. For ex
ample, black women comprised 
a much higher percentage of physically forced only victims (23%) than any other 
victimization type. Among AOD-enabled only victims, the vast majority (80%) were white. 
Seniors represented the highest percentage of victims in each
 assault type. Interestingly, 
almost a quarter of the victims of both type
s of sexual assault be
longed to a sorority, 
whereas only 14% of nonvictims were sorority members.  
Attendance at fraternity parties and partie
s where alcohol was served was much higher 
among victims of AOD-enabled and both types of
 sexual assault than for physically forced 
victims only. Ninety percent of AOD-enabled victims reported attending a party where 
alcohol was served at least once a month, compared to 57% of physically forced sexual 
assault victims. Substance use was higher among victims of
 AOD-enabled only and both 
types of sexual assault, comp
ared to victims of physically forced sexual assault and 
nonvictims. Much higher proportions of AOD-
enabled only sexual assault victims report getting drunk, accepting drinks from strangers, leaving drinks unattended, and consuming 
alcohol or drugs and/or being drunk or hi
gh during sex, since entering college.  
Multivariate Results 
Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with being a victim of 
three types of assault: physically forced se
xual assault only, AOD-
enabled sexual assault 
only, or both physically forced and AOD-enable
d sexual assault. In so
me cases, covariates 
in the models reflect individual characteristi
cs and in others represen
t potential behavioral 
risk factors. The purpose of each model is 
to identify individual
 characteristics and 
behavioral factors that are associ
ated with being a victim of ea
ch type of assault. Although 
there are certainly some similarities across the three models, there are also some notable 
differences. Results of each of the mo
dels are presented in Exhibit 5-6.

bData reflect time since entering college. 
We discuss the odds ratios asso
ciated with each independent 
variable. An odds ratio is a statistic that conveys the risk of a particular outcome (e.g., be
ing a victim of a certain type 
of sexual assault) if a certain independent variable or factor is present. It is a relative 
measure of risk, telling you how much more (or less) likely it is that someone who presents 
a particular risk factor will 
experience a given outcome compared to someone who does not 
that particular risk factor. If no relationship
 exists between a risk factor and the outcome, 
the odds ratio will be 
1.0. An odds ratio above 1.0 indica
tes a positive relationship between 
the risk factor and the outcome 
(i.e., the presence of the risk 
factor increases the odds that the outcome will be realized), and an odds ration below 1.0 indicates a negative relationship 
between the risk factor and the outcome (i.e., the presence of the risk factor decreases the 

odds that the outcome will be realized). 
Being a Victim of Physically Forced Sexual Assault Only.
 Having been a victim of 
physically forced sexual assault before enteri
ng college was signific
antly associated with experiencing physically forced sexual assaul
t since entering college
. Experiencing sexual assault when incapacitated prior to entering co
llege did not reach statistical significance at 
conventional alpha levels (e.g., 0.05). Interestingly, none of the substance use measures 
were significantly associated with physically forced sexual victimization. Several variables

 The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
reflecting college experi
ences were associated with an increased risk of physically forced 
sexual assault. The number of 
sexual partners a woman has had since entering college was 
significantly associated with forced sexual assault only, as
 was the combined measure of 
dating violence (been threatened/humiliated or physically hurt by a dating partner).  
The more years a woman reported being in college, the greater the odds that she 
experienced physically forced sexual assault. Al
though the odds ratio is not large (1.2), this 
is a continuous measure, so a single unit increase in the number of years in college is 
associated with a significant increase in th
e odds that a woman has been a victim of 
physically forced sexual assaul
t since entering college. This finding is not surprising given 
that the more years a woman has been in co
llege, the more exposure she has had to 
potentially being assaulted since entering college. However, when examining the time point 

at which sexual assault is most likely to ha
ppen (by restricting the analyses to sexual 
assaults occurring within the past 12 months), the risk is greater for sophomores than for 
juniors and seniors (data not shown).
16  Being a Victim of AOD-Enabled Sexual Assault Only. 
Slightly more variables were 
significantly associated with experiencing AOD-enabled sexual assault than were evident in 
Model 1. Having been a victim of incapacita
ted sexual assault befo
re entering college increased the likelihood of expe
riencing incapacitate
d sexual assault sinc
e entering college, whereas prior physically forced victimization did not.  
Most of the substance use measures were significantly associated with AOD-enabled sexual 
assault. The frequencies with which women re
ported getting drunk since entering college 
was positively associated with being a victim of AOD-enab
led sexual assault, as was 
marijuana use. Interestingly, voluntary use of other drugs was 
not a significant risk factor 
for any of the three categories
 of assault. The frequency with which women reported being 
drunk during sex was also asso
ciated with being a victim of
 AOD-enabled sexual assault. 
Having been given a drug without one™s know
ledge or consent since entering college was 
strongly associated with being a victim of AOD-enabled assault. The odds ratio for this 
measure is sizeable (2.3); however, it is important to point out that most women who were 

ever given a drug without th
eir knowledge or consent were not subsequently sexually 
assaultedŠ308 women in our sample (5.3%) re
ported being given a drug without their 
knowledge or consent at some point during 
college, but only 31 of these women were 
sexually assaulted thereafter, and these wo
men have been exclud
ed from the current 
analyses, as discussed in the me
thods section. It may be that being given a drug without 
one™s knowledge and being sexually assaulted are both consequences of other risk factors or 
risky situations in which women sometimes find
 themselves. Some of the same behavioral 
risk factors associated with
 sexual assault (e.g., freque
ncy of getting drunk, using 
                                         
 16Freshmen were excluded from the analyses because the ﬁpast 12 monthﬂ measure could have 
included assaults occurring prior to entering college. 
5-12 
 Section 5 Š Findings marijuana, and being drunk du
ring sex) are also significan
t when the outcome of being 
given a drug without their know
ledge is regressed on the same
 set of covariates (analysis not shown). The frequency with which wome
n reported being drunk during sex since 
entering college is positively 
associated with being a victim 
of AOD-enabled sexual assault. Regarding the relationship between college ex
periences and AOD-enabled sexual assault, 
the frequency with which women attended frat
ernity parties since entering college was 
positively associated with being a victim of AOD-enabled sexu
al assault, as was having been 
humiliated or hurt by a dating partner. Regarding demographics, years in college was 
positively associated with being a victim of forced sexual assault. Also, being in the ﬁotherﬂ 
race category was negatively a
ssociated with being a victim 
of AOD-enabled sexual assault only.  Being a Victim of Both Physically Forced and AOD-Enabled Sexual Assault.
 In the final model, both measures of sexual victimization prior to entering college were 
significantly associated with being a victim of both physically forced and AOD-enabled 

sexual assault during college. 
Also interesting is that when the individual indicators for 
physically forced sexual assault before coll
ege and incapacitated se
xual assault before college were replaced with a single
 combined indicator for experienced both physically 
forced and incapacitated sexual assault before college, those wo
men who experienced both 
types of prior victimizations (n = 109) had 5 
times the odds of experi
enced both physically 
forced and AOD-enabled sexual assault du
ring college, compared to other women 
(OR = 5.3, analyses not shown). 
In addition, the frequency with which women re
ported getting drunk since entering college 
was positively associated with being a victim of both physically forced and AOD-enabled 

assault. Having been given a drug without one™s knowledge or consent since entering 

college was strongly associated 
with experiencing both types of assault, with an odds ratio 
of 5.1. There were no relationships between marijuana or other illicit drug use and 

experiencing both types of victimization, but the frequency with which women reported 

being drunk during sex since ente
ring college was positively a
ssociated with being a victim 
of both forms of sexual assault. 
The frequency with which women attended frat
ernity parties since entering college was 
positively associated with a woman experiencing both types 
of sexual assault, although this 
relationship did not quite reach significance at the 0.05 level. The number of sexual partners 
a woman has had since entering college was signif
icantly associated with being in the ﬁbothﬂ 
sexual assault category
. In addition, having been threatened/humiliated or physically hurt 
by a dating partner was significan
tly associated with being a victim of both physically forced 
and AOD-enabled sexual assault. Interestingly, the dating violence measure is the only 
variable that maintained significance across all three assault categories. Only one 

demographic variable was significantly associated with experiencing both physically forced 
5-13 
 The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
and AOD-enabled sexual assault; being in the ﬁotherﬂ race category was positively 
associated with being a victim of both physic
ally forced and AOD-enabled sexual assault.  
Not surprisingly, prior victimization was strongly associated with victimization since entering 
college. This pattern is supported by numerous studies in the literature. However, what is 
evident (and unique) about our 
findings is that there appear
s to be specificity in the 
relationship between prior and subs
equent risk with regard to the type
 of sexual assault. Specifically, being a victim of forced sexual assault before entering college was significantly 

associated with being a victim of forced 
sexual assault since entering college but
 not AOD-
enabled sexual assault, in the exclusive victimization cate
gories. The magnitude of the odds 
ratio for this relationship (6.6) is extremely largeŠhaving been a victim of forced sexual 

assault before entering college increases the odds that a woman will be forcibly sexually 

assaulted while in college by almost seven times. Similarly, being a victim of AOD-enabled 
sexual assault before en
tering college was significantly as
sociated with being a victim of 
AOD-enabled sexual assault but not physically forced sexual a
ssault since entering college. The odds ratio (3.6) for this relationship is al
so large. Not surprisingly, both types of prior 
victimization are positively a
ssociated with experiencing both physically forced and AOD-
enabled sexual assault during 
college. These findings among the exclusive forced assault 
and AOD-enabled assault categories clearly show that being 
a victim of one type of sexual 
assault does not seem to put one at risk for 
the other type, and vice versa. This is not a 
finding we have observed in the pub
lished literature on
 sexual assault. 5.1.3 Context  
The CSA Study captured substantial information on the context in which the sexual assault 
occurred. Because a primary purpose of the CS
A Study was to identify differences between 
physically forced sexual assaul
t and incapacitated sexual assa
ult on a number of dimensions 
(including contextual factors), we asked separa
te sets of contextual questions for the two 
types of sexual assault. Resp
ondents who answered affirmatively to the gate questions on 
attempted or completed physically forced sexual
 assault or incapacita
ted sexual assault for 
which the respondent was certain happened or
 suspected happened si
nce entering college were asked detailed follow-up 
questions specific to the assault type. This report only 
includes data for female victims of complete
d sexual assault (of both types). Exhibit 5-7 
presents contextual factors asso
ciated with both types of sexu
al assault. Cross-tabulations 
and chi-square tests were conducted compar
ing the contextual ch
aracteristics of the 
incidents of victims of physically forced se
xual assault only and victims of incapacitated 
sexual assault only (victims of both types of assault were excluded from these 2 x 2 
analyses). For incapacitated sexu
al assault, the data are presented for female victims of any 
incapacitated sexual assault (w
hich includes AOD-enabled sexual assault, DFSA, and other 

incapacitated sexual assault).  5-14

aAs discussed in Section 3.0, for victims who reported experiencing more than one sexual assault of a 
single type (e.g., two or more physically forced victimizations or two or more incapacitated 
victimizations), the contextual questions typically asked about ﬁany of the incidents.ﬂ Therefore, the 
percentages contained in this table should be interpreted as the percentage of victims (of each 

specific assault type) who reported the particular contextual variable in the table, rather than the % 
of incidents for which the contextual variable was present. 
bData unavailable due to programming error during survey administration. 
Assailant Characteristics The first set of contextual variables pertain to characteristics 
of the assailant. As shown in 
the exhibit, less than 15% of physically forced
 and incapacitated vict
ims were assaulted by 
more than one person; however, the groups 
did not differ signific
antly. Regarding the 
relationship between the victim and the assailant and keeping in mind that respondents 
could select more than one category for this ques
tion, it is evident that
 a small proportion of victims reported being assaulted by someone 
they had never seen or talked to before. 
Victims of physically forced se
xual assault were much more lik
ely than incapacitated assault 
victims to be assaulted by so
meone they had never seen or
 talked to (23% vs. 12%, 
respectively), or by a former intimate pa
rtner (20% vs. 9%, respectively). A higher 
percentage of incapacitated se
xual assault victims were victimized by a friend. This 
assailant-victim relationship was reported most
 often by incapacitated assault victims.  
Interestingly, over a quarter of incapacitate
d sexual assault victims reported that the assailant was a fraternity member at the time of the incident; this proportion is significantly 
higher than that reported by victims of physically forced sexual assault (28% vs. 14%, 
respectively). Also of interest 
is that a significantly higher proportion of incapacitated sexual 
assault victims (80%) than physically forced se
xual assault victims (57%) reported that the 
assailant was white. In contract, a much high
er percentage of physically forced victims 
(39%) reported that the assailant was black,
 compared to incapacitated victims (16%). 
5-18 
 Section 5 Š Findings Substance Use The vast majority of incapacitated sexual a
ssault victims reported that the assailant had 
been drinking and/or using 
drugs before the incident.
17 Differences in su
bstance use on the 
part of the victim by assault type are evident in the table. Not surprisingly, the vast 
majority of incapacitated sexual
 assault victims (89%) reported drinking alcohol, and being 
drunk (82%), prior to their victimization. This is much higher than the proportion of 
physically forced victims who reported drinking (33%) and being drunk (13%) prior to their 
assault. Drug use was relatively low among 
both groups, although a slightly higher 
proportion of incapacitated sexual assault victims reported having voluntarily used drugs 
before the incident (8% vs. 2%). For victims of
 either type of sexual assault who reported 
voluntary drug use, the most commonly used drugs were marijuana, cocaine, 
methamphetamine, 
and ecstasy.  Only victims reporting incapaci
tated sexual assault were aske
d whether they had been given 
a drug without their knowledge or consent immediately before 
the assault. A low proportion 
of incapacitated sexual assault only victims (4%) reported su
ch coercive drug ingestion. Of 
these victims, the drugs reportedly used to incapacitate them were Rohypnol, GHB, 
marijuana, and ecstasy, although it is worth noting that over half of incapacitated sexual 
assault victims who reported coercive drug in
gestion stated that they did not know which 
drug they were given. Location 
A surprisingly large number of respondents reported that they were at a party when the 
incident happened, with
 a significantly larger proportion
 of incapacitated sexual assault 
victims reporting this setting (58% compared 
with 28%). The majority of sexual assault 
victims of both types reported that the 
incident had happened off campus (61% of 
incapacitated sexual assault victims and 63% of physically 
forced sexual assault victims). A 
higher proportion of physically forced than incapacitated sexu
al assaults occurred outside. 
The most commonly-reported locations of either type of victimization, on and off-campus, 
were the victim™s or some other person™s living quarters. No other significant differences by 

assault type are evident.  Timing of Incidents  
Substantial variability in the time of year in which sexual assault incidents took place is 
evident, with fall clearly bein
g the most prevalent season fo
r sexual assault. The largest 
proportion of victims (of both types of sexual 
assault) reported being victimized in October 
(20% of physically forced sexual assault vi
ctims and 16% of incapa
citated sexu
al assault victims). Not surprisingly, the 
vast majority of victims re
ported being victimized on 
                                         
 17Unfortunately, the percentage of physically forced sexual assault victims who reported assailant 
alcohol and/or drug use cannot be determined, because of an error in the survey program that 
saved all responses as either ﬁdrinking onlyﬂ or ﬁdon™t know.ﬂ

ssault victims and 36% of
 incapacitated sexual assault victims) or Friday (22% of physica

 the hours from midnight to 
6:00 a.m.; the prevalence of 
this is significantly higher among incapacitate
d assault victims. However, although victims 
of both types are most likely to be assaulte
d from midnight to 6:
00 a.m., a significantly 
higher proportion of physically forced victims are assaulted 
during earlier hours (noon to 
6:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. to midnight). Forty-five percent of physically forced victims, 
compared to 13% of incapacita
ted victims, reported being a
ssaulted between 6:00 p.m. and 
midnight.  Weapon Use and Injuries Very few victims of either type
 of sexual assault reported th
at the assailant had or claimed 
to have a weapon. The proportion reporting 
assailant weapon possession was higher for 
victims of physically forced sexual assault than
 incapacitated sexual a
ssault. The proportion 
of victims reporting that they had sustained injuries in the assault is relatively low, 
although, not surprisingly, a greater proportion 
of physically forced 
sexual assault victims (18%) reported being injured than incapacitated sexual assa
ult victims (3%). Among those 
who sustained injuries, the mo
st prevalent were emotional or psychological injury;
18 injury 
from the sexual contact; and bruises, black-eyes, cuts, scratches, or swelling.
19  Perception of Any Incidents as Rape 
When asked if they considered the incident to be rape, a significantly higher percentage of 
physically forced victims (40%) answered af
firmatively, compared to only 25% of the 
incapacitated assault vi
ctims. Because our cla
ssification of sexual assault includes both 
battery (unwanted touching achieved by physical force or incapacitation of the victim) and 

rape (vaginal, oral, anal, or object penetration achieved by phys
ical force or incapacitation of the victim), not all victims were indeed 
raped. When subsetting to victims who were 
                                         
 18Although a large proportion of victims reported experiencing emotional or psychological injury, we 
anticipate that in reality, the number is substantially larger. If the gate question used to identify 
victims sustaining an injury had specifically referred to emotional or psychological injury, we 
suspect that many more victims would have answered affirmatively and then selected emotional or 
psychological injury in the follow-up question that asked specifically about the types of injuries 

sustained.  
19Exhibit 5-7 includes ﬁknocked unconsciousﬂ in the same category as ﬁbruises, black-eye, cuts, 
scratches, or swellingﬂ because of a programming 
error in the follow-up responses to physically 
forced sexual assault incidents, in which the re
sponses to the ﬁbruises, etc.ﬂ were saved with 
ﬁknocked unconscious.ﬂ Based on the responses to incapacitated sexual assault (in which the two 

sets of responses were saved in the appropriate category, with only 3 respondents reporting being 

knocked unconscious and 22 reporting experiencing br
uises, etc.), we can deduce that very few 
physically forced sexual assault victims were knocked unconscious and that most of the victims 
experienced the latter type of injury (i.e., brui
ses, black-eyes, cuts, scratches, or swelling). 
5-20 
 Section 5 Š Findings raped, 64.6% of physically forced rape vict
ims and 37.8% of incapa
citated rape victims considered the incident to be rape.20  5.1.4 Reporting and Nonreporting  
Victims of both types of sexual
 assault were asked detailed sets of questions about informal 
and formal reporting of the event. Their resp
onses were compared using chi-square tests. 
The reporting data are presented in Exhibit 5-8.  
Family Member or Friend The first category of disclosure
 pertains to someone close to
 the victim. The majority of 
victims of both types of assault reported that
 they told someone such as a family member, 
friend, roommate, or intimate partner. A slight
ly higher proportion of physically forced 
sexual assault victims 
(70%) than incapacitated sexual as
sault victims (64%) reported this 
type of disclosure, although
 these percentages were no
t significantly different.  
Victim™s, Crisis, or Health Care Center 
A very small percentage of victims reported that they contacted a victim™s, crisis, or health 
care center after the incident. Once again, this type of disclosure was more prevalent 
among physically forced sexual
 assault victims (16%) than 
incapacitated se
xual assault 
victims (8%). Because of the small number of vi
ctims who reported contacting this type of 
service agency, the data on fo
llow-up questions pertaining to this experience should be 
interpreted with caution. A significantly high
er percentage of physically forced victims 
reported to a crisis center or victim™s serv
ices program, or counselor or therapist not 
affiliated with their university. Although physically forced sexual assault victims were most 
likely to contact a counselor or therapist not 
affiliated with the university, incapacitated 
sexual assault victims were most likely to contact a doctor™s office or medical facility 

affiliated with the university. Just over three-fourths of physically forced sexual assault 

victims who contacted a victim™s, crisis, or health care center reported receiving a physical 
or sexual assault examination, and just half of incapacitated 
sexual assault victims reported 
receiving such an examination. Most commonly, victims of physically forced sexual assault 
contacted a victim™s, crisis, or 
health care center after 24 hours but within 1 week of the 
incident.21 The vast majority of victims who contac
ted a victim™s, crisis, or health care 
center were satisfied with the way their repo
rting was handled, but a few regretted that 
they reported the incident to this type of center. Slightly more victims of incapacitated 
sexual assault stated that they
 were satisfied with the way th
eir reporting was handled, and                                          
 20The proportion of sexual assault or rape victims who reported that they consider the incident to be 
rape is difficult to interpret for victims reporting more than one incident of a type because these 
victims were asked whether they considered any of the incidents to be rape. 
21The time period of contact for incapacitated sexual assault victims cannot be determined because of 
a programming error.

aAs discussed in Section 3.0, for victims who reported experiencing more than one sexual assault of a 
single type (e.g., two or more physically forced victimizations or two or more incapacitated 
victimizations), the contextual questions typically asked about ﬁany of the incidents.ﬂ Therefore, the 
percentages contained in this table should be interpreted as the percentage of victims (of each 
specific assault type) who reported the particular contextual variable in the table, rather than the % 
of incidents for which the contextual variable was present. 
bData unavailable due to programming error during survey administration. 
Law Enforcement A similarly small proportion of victims of both ty
pes stated that they re
ported the incident to a law enforcement agency, with 
incapacitated sexual assault victims once again being less 
likely to report the incident to this type of agency (2% vs. 13%). However, of victims who 
reported to law enforcement, a much higher 
proportion of incapacitated assault victims, 
compared to physically forced assault victim
s, reported to campus police (86% vs. 25%, 
respectively). The majority of incapacita
ted sexual assault vi
ctims contacted law enforcement within 24 hours of the incident, wh
ereas large proportions of physically forced 
victims reported within 3 hour
s (27%), within one week (23%
), and more than one month 
after the incident (21%). Less than half of physically forced sexual assault victims stated 
that they were satisfied with the way thei
r reporting to law enforcement was handled,
22 and 17% stated that they regretted reportin
g the incident to law enforcement.  
The victims who did not report 
the incident to law enforcemen
t were asked why they made 
this decision. The most commonly 
reported response by both types of victims was that they 
did not think it was serious enough to report (reported by 56% 
of physically forced sexual 
assault victims and 67% of inca
pacitated sexual a
ssault victims). The other consistently 
reported reasons for not reporting were that 
it was unclear that a crime was committed or 
that harm was intended (selecte
d by just over 35% of both types of victims), and that they 
did not want anyone to know about the incide
nt (selected by 42% of physically forced 
sexual assault victims and 29% 
of incapacitated sexual assault victims). Relatively large 
                                         
 22The proportion of incapacitated sexual assault victims cannot be determined because of a 
programming error. 
5-25 
 The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
proportions of incapacitated sexual assault victims stated th
at they did not report the 
incident because they thought they were partially or fully responsible (50%) and that they 
did not remember or know what really happene
d (31%). These response options were only provided as options for incapaci
tated sexual assa
ult victims.  Testing for DFSA In the reporting section of the interview, vict
ims of incapacitated sexu
al assault were asked whether anyone to whom they ha
d reported the incident took 
a blood or urine sample from them. Only three of the women who experien
ced incapacitated sexual assault only had a 
blood or urine sample drawn. Of those three women, one™s results were 
positive. If we look 
at all victims of incapacitate
d sexual assault, regardless of if they also experienced 
physically forced sexual assault, seven of 
these incapacitated sexual assault victims had 
blood or urine samples taken. Three of these vic
tims reported that the results of the test 
was positive, with all three drug tests indicating the pres
ence of Rohypnol. 
5.1.5 Consequences  
Finally, sexual assault victims of both types were asked about actions they took as a result 
of the incident and consequences received by 
the assailant. As shown in
 Exhibit 5-9, for the 
most part victims of both types did not report
 taking the actions about which the instrument 
asked. Beyond avoiding or trying to avoid the assailant (reported by about two-thirds of 
victims of both sexual assaul
t types), the respondents were unlikely to report action 
stemming from the assault. Twenty-two percent of physically forced sexual assault victims 
and 6% of incapacitated sexual
 assault victims reported that
 they sought psychological 
counseling, a statistically significant difference.  
Not surprisingly, given the very low percentage of victims who 
reported the incident to law 
enforcement, a very small number of victims of 
either type reported that they pursued any 
action against the assailant, including seeking a restraining order, filing civil charges, 
pursuing criminal charges, or filing a grievance or initiating other disciplinary action with 

university officials. However, a slightly higher proportion of physically forced victims 
reported pursuing criminal charges. A very small number of victims reported that the 
assailant received any disciplinary action from the university or that the assailant was 

arrested, prosecuted, or convicted by the crim
inal justice system, but a higher percentage 
of physically forced victims reported this latter outcome.

5.2 Sexual Assault Perpetration 
As an exploratory component of the CSA St
udy, we asked the sample of 1,375 male 
undergraduates at the two participating univ
ersities whether they perpetrated sexual 
assault since entering 
college. The perpetration question
s were worded similarly to the 
victimization items presented previously. Although 19% (n = 1,073) of the sample of 
undergraduate women reported ex
periencing some type of attempted or completed sexual 
assault since entering 
college, only 2.5% (n = 34) of
 the male undergraduate sample 
reported perpetrating any type of sexual 
assault, either completed or attempted. 
Approximately 1.8% (n = 25) of males report
ed perpetrating a comp
leted sexual assault 
5-27 
 The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
since entering college. All but on
e of these cases were perpetra
tors of incapacitated sexual assault (n = 24). A slightly higher number of 
males reported perpetrating either completed 
or attempted incapacitated sexual assault (n = 33, 2.4%).  
When subsetting to the perpetrators of comple
ted incapacitated sexual 
assault, 29% (n = 6) 
of perpetrators were on a date with the victim at the time of the incident. Twenty-nine 
percent of these perpetrators (n = 7) reported
 that the victim was a 
member of a sorority. 
None of the perpetrators report
ed giving the victim a drug wi
thout her consent. Over three-
quarters of the perpetrators (n = 21, 86.2%) re
ported that the victim was drinking before 
the incident, and 81.0% of perp
etrators had been drinking be
fore the incident. Ninety-four 
percent of those who had been drinking report
ed that they were drunk before the sexual 
assault incident occurred. None of the perpetrators of incapacitated sexual assault, whether 
penetration of the victim occurred or not,
 considered the incident to be rape.  
We have concerns about the validity of the pe
rpetration data. We suspect that some males 
who have perhaps perpetrated sexual assault 
since entering college consciously answered our survey questions about perpetration nega
tively and untruthfully. We also believe, 
however, that some males answered our question
s negatively and honestly in that they do 
not believe what they did fit the descriptions 
we used in our questi
ons. Their accounts of 
what happened may differ considerably from that of the self-identified victim. This is not to 
say they were not perpetrators, but it helps ex
plain why our self-repor
ted perpetration rates are so much lower than our self-reported ra
tes of sexual assault victimization. Other 
possible explanations for the discrepancy betw
een the percentage of women who reported 
being victimized and the percentage of men who reported perpetrati
ng sexual assaults 
include: (1) the men who participated in the CSA survey were significantly less likely to be 

perpetrators of sexual assault than men who did not participate in the CSA survey, and 

(2) relatively few men sexually
 assault women, but those wh
o do sexually assault many 
women, which results in there being relatively few perpetrators and many victims. 
5-28 
  6. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 6.1 Summary of Findings 
One of the primary purposes of
 the CSA Study was to determin
e the prevalence of various types of sexual assault. Of part
icular interest was the prevalen
ce of DFSA. It is quite clear 
that a sizeable proportion of undergradu
ate women (11.1%) have experienced sexual 
assault when they were incapa
citated and unable to provide co
nsent, but the large majority of these victims had not been given a drug with
out their knowledge prior to the assault. The 
large majority (n = 566, 84%) of the 651 
women who experienced 
incapacitated sexual assault were victims of AOD-enabled, rather th
an drug-facilitated, sexual assault. Only 31 
(0.6%) of the 5,446 undergraduate women wh
o participated in the CSA Study reported 
being sexually assaulted after 
being given a drug without thei
r knowledge or consent since entering college. There are no estimates in the literature to which this figure can be 
compared, but given the attention that DFSA an
d ﬁdate rape drugsﬂ have received in the 
media in recent years, this estimate is al
most certainly lower than some might have 
expected. Clearly, undergraduate women are at 
much greater risk of sexual assault that 
occurs in the context of voluntary consumption of
 alcohol and/or drugs or that is physically 
forced than sexual assault that is drug facilitated.  
The phenomenon of being given a drug wi
thout one™s knowledge is, however, not 
necessarily rare among our sample. A total of
 308 women in our sample of 5,446 (5.3%) 
reported being given a drug without their knowledge or consen
t since entering college and 
the drugs most likely to be 
administered were Rohypnol 
and GHB, which are commonly 
referred to as date rape drugs. Women bein
g given a drug withou
t their knowledge or 
consent appears be a legitimate concern for universities and students, but it is unclear 
whether widespread concerns about DFSA can be justified empirically. 
Another interesting finding ge
nerated by the CSA Study is that the prevalence of 
experiencing sexual assault is 
higher since entering college 
(13.7%) than before entering 
college (11.3%). However, our survey was done at a single point in time and during a time 
period when collegiate experiences are more 
salient, so it may be that subjects had 
difficulty recalling sexual
 assaults that occurred before en
tering college. On the other hand, 
it is important to point out that our ﬁsince 
entering collegeﬂ estimates do not reflect the 
sample™s entire collegiate ex
perience because the sample in
cludes freshman, sophomores, and juniors (and even seniors had not complete
d their senior year), which means that the 
true rate of sexual assault during the enti
re college experience 
is likely higher. When 
subsetting to seniors, the data show th
at 368 women (26.1% of
 seniors) reported experiencing attempted or completed sexual 
assault since entering college. Ninety-two 
(7.0%) seniors were victims of physically forc
ed sexual assault sinc
e entering college, and 
223 (16.0%) seniors were victims 
of incapacitated sexual assaul
t since entering college. It is important to note, however, that although 
the cumulative prevalence estimates of sexual 6-1  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
assault are understandably highest for seniors, 
the ﬁpast 12 monthﬂ pr
evalence estimates of sexual assault are highest among sophomores.
23 This pattern indicates that women who are 
victimized during college are most likely to be victimized early on in their college tenure. 
This finding is consistent with a recent study employing a convenience sample of university 

women, which found that 84% of the women wh
o reported sexually coercive situations 
experienced the incident during their first four semesters 
on campus (Gross, Winslett, 
Roberts, & Gohm, 2006).  
Not surprisingly, the CSA Study found that th
e prevalence of sexual assault among male college students was considerably lower than
 similar estimates for women. A total of 50 
males (3.7%) reported being victims of complete
d sexual assault since entering college. The 
majority of these victims (90.2%) were victims 
of incapacitated sexual assault. Estimates of 
the sexual victimization of adult males are sparse in the literature, so it is difficult to 
compare the CSA Study findings to thos
e produced by existing research.  
Our multivariate analyses identifying risk fact
ors for sexual assault 
among university women 
indicate that several factors are differentially
 associated with specific types of sexual 
assault. Specifically, compared to whites, Hispanic women were more likely to be victims of 
physically forced sexual assault. Years in co
llege and the number of dating partners were 
both positively associated with experiencing physically
 forces sexual assault and 
experiencing physically forced and AOD-enab
led sexual assault. Victims of AOD-enabled 
assault and both types of assaul
t more frequently attended fr
aternity parties, got drunk, 
had ever been given a drug wi
thout their consent, and were frequently drunk during sex 
since entering college. Victims of AOD-enabled sexual assault only were more likely to have 
used marijuana. In contrast, none of these ri
sk factors were signific
antly associated with being a victim of forced sexual assault. Ever having been threatened, humiliated, or 
physically hurt by a dating partner was a risk fa
ctor for all three measures of sexual assault. 
Interestingly, having been a victim of forced
 sexual assault before 
entering college was a risk factor for being a victim of forced (but 
not AOD-enabled) sexual assault since entering 
college, and having been a victim of incapacita
ted sexual before enteri
ng college was a risk factor for being a victim of AOD-enabled (but not forced) sexual assault since entering 

college. Other studies have found that previous victimization is a risk factor for future 

victimization, but this is the first study we 
are aware of that has 
determine that being a 
victim of a certain type of sexu
al assault puts one at risk of being a victim of that type of 
sexual assault, and not necessar
ily another type of sexual assa
ult. In other words, the risk 
posed by previous victimization is specific to the type of victimization experienced.  
Descriptive analyses of the co
ntext, consequences, and report
ing of sexual assault also 
confirm that differences exist between forced an
d incapacitated sexual 
assault. For example,                                          
 23While the ﬁpast 12 monthﬂ prevalence is also high
 among freshmen, they were excluded from these 
comparisons of sexual assault prevalence because they had not experienced 12 months of college. 
6-2  Section 6 Š Conclusion and Recommendations forced sexual assaults were more likely
 to involve a black perpetrator, whereas incapacitated sexual assaults were more likely to involve a white perpetrator. Forced 
assaults were also more
 likely to be perpetrated by a stranger to the victim or an ex-dating 
partner or ex-spouse, whereas incapacitated sexual assaults were
 more likely to be 
perpetrated by a friend or acquaintance of th
e victim. Additionally, mo
re than a quarter of incapacitated sexual assault victims were victimized by a member of a fraternity. Not 
surprisingly, victims of incapaci
tated sexual assault were consid
erably more likely to have 
been using alcohol before and 
be drunk during the assault. 
Incapacitated a
ssaults were 
more likely to happen at a pa
rty and between midnight and 6 
a.m., whereas forced sexual 
assaults were more likely to happen between 
noon and midnight. Victims of forced sexual 
assault were more likely to be injured and 
to consider the incident to be rape.  
Victims of forced sexual assault 
were more likely to report th
e assault to friends or family, 
crisis centers, and law enforcement, but they 
were also less satisfie
d with how the report 
was handled and more likely to regret report
ing the assault than incapacitated sexual 
assault victims who reported thei
r assaults. Overall, victims of forced sexual assault were 
also more likely to make changes in their lives in
 reaction to the assault, such as dropping a 
class, moving, and changing ma
jors, and were more likely to seek psychological counseling 
as a result of the victimization.  
6.2 CSA Study Implications 
Sexual assault is clearly an issue in need of attention by the campus community given its 
high prevalence and adverse consequences, an
d the CSA Study results carry many social 
and policy-oriented implications. One out of 
five undergraduate women experience an 
attempted or completed sexual assault since en
tering college. Moreover, attention must be 
paid to the following facts: 
 the majority of sexual assaults occur when women are incapacitated due to their use 
of substances, primarily alcohol;  
 freshmen and sophomores are at greater 
risk for victimization than juniors and 
seniors; and  the large majority of victims of sexual assault are victimized by
 men they know and 
trust, rather than strangers.  
It is thus critical that sexual assault prevention strategies and messa
ges be designed such 
that undergraduates are educated (and as soon after enrollment as possible) about these 
facts. Most importantly, because most sexual assaults expe
rienced by university women are 
enabled by alcohol or other drugs, one clear im
plication is the need to address the risks of 
substance use, particularly the 
risk of drinking to excess, in sexual assault prevention 
messages presented to university students. 
For many students, college offers an 
environment notorious for enco
uraging excessive drinking and experimenting with drugs. 
Most students are simply unable to gauge th
e amount of alcohol consumed, are unaware of 
6-3  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
the effects of new drugs or the mixing of drugs and alcohol, and are unfamiliar with the 
point at which their cognitive ability is so im
paired that they cannot protect themselves. Students may also be unaware of the image of vulnerability projected by a visibly 
intoxicated individual. Despite the link between 
substance use and sexual assault, it appears 

that few sexual assault preventi
on and/or risk reduction prog
rams address the relationship 
between substance use and sexual assault. In 
a review of 15 universi
ty-based prevention 
interventions conducted between 1994 and 1999, 
only three included references to alcohol 
use (Bachar & Koss, 2001). 
Another important implication stems from our finding of DFSA being an extremely rare 
occurrence. Universities should continue to be mindful of this phenomenon and educate 
students about the potential dangers and cons
equences of clandestin
ely giving someone a 
drug or being given a drug. However, an over
emphasis on DFSA takes attention away from 
the true nature of campus sexual assault, igno
ring the fact that most
 sexual assaults occur 
after voluntary alcohol consumption by the vict
im and assailant. Universities must address 
the dangers of voluntary alcohol consumption ra
ther than focusing on
 the rare phenomenon 
of coercive drug ingestion.  
Finally, the very low rates of 
reporting sexual assault to cris
is centers and law enforcement 
suggest that perhaps more can be done to en
courage reporting. When reports of sexual 
assault are handled properly and effectively, the process can be important to the recovery 
and healing of the victim, as well as the identification, punishment, and deterrence of 
perpetration. Universities an
d law enforcement should th
us seek out and implement 
strategies that encourage reporting of sexual assault and ensu
re reports of sexual assault 
are being handled properly. The fact that a large proportion of sexual assault victims had 

been drinking before the incident may part
icularly discourage repo
rting, given victim 
concerns about reprisal for violating campus po
licies on drug and alcohol use. Other studies 
have suggested that university administrators 
believe policies allowing for confidential and 
anonymous reporting encourage reporting (Karjane, Fisher, & Cullen, 2005).  
In addition, even though some women experience their first sexual assault after entering 
college, many women who expe
rience sexual assault during college had been sexually 
victimized before coming to college. Since 
women who have experi
enced sexual assault before entering college have a much greater ch
ance of experiencing 
sexual assault during college, it is important that sexual assault programming reflects this reality. Programs 
should focus on both primary prevention 
for women who have not experienced sexual 
assault and secondary prevention in an
 effort to prevent re-victimization (
although more research is needed to guide the develo
pment of effective secondary prevention 
programming).  6-4  Section 6 Š Conclusion and Recommendations Sexual assault prevention programs for women could involve: 
 Providing accurate information on legal definitions of sexual assault, the extent and 
nature of sexual assault among college women, and risk factors for sexual assault 
(e.g., risky sexual behaviors, multiple sex partners, the role of substances); 
 Combining sexual assault prevention education with alcohol and drug education 
programming (e.g., education concerning how levels of alcohol consumption and use 
of different drugs, and their 
interactions, affect cognitiv
e functions; harm reduction 
messages; education about the impact of 
alcohol and drug use, especially heavy 
episodic drinking, has on cognitive functions, which reduces one™s ability to detect 
dangerous cues and threats, and one™s ability to effectively resist unwanted advances 
that can arise in common college social situations);  Stressing that even though many sexual 
assaults involves substance use by the 
victim, this does not imply that women are to blame for their sexual assault. 
Victimization is committed by the perpetrato
r, and therefore the sole responsibility 
for the assault lies with the perpetrator; 
 Educating women about different types of 
sexual assault, especially since there appears to be continuity in the type of
 sexual assault expe
rienced over time (physically forced or incapa
citated sexual assault);   Teaching effective sexu
al assault resistance strategies to reduce
 harm, particularly 
with respect to strategies for protection
 from men that women know and trust;  
 Educating women about how to increase 
their assertiveness and self-efficacy;  
 Conveying knowledge about how to report to 
police or school official
s, the availability of different types of serv
ices on and off campus;  Stressing the importance of reporting incidents of attempted an
d completed sexual 
assault to mental and/or 
physically health service pr
oviders and security/law 
enforcement personnel, and th
e importance to seeking serv
ices, especially given the 
well-documented negative im
pacts sexual assault can ha
ve on psychological and 
physical functioning.  
Programs for men to prevent sexual 
assault perpetration could include:  Providing accurate information on legal definitions of and legal penalties for sexual 
assault;  Informing men that they are ultimately re
sponsible for determining (1) whether or 
not a women has consented to sexual cont
act, and (2) whether or not a women is 
capable of providing consent; and 
 Educating men that an intoxicated person 
cannot legally consent 
to sexual contact 
and that having sexual cont
act with an intoxicated or incapacitated person is 
unacceptable. 
All of these prevention programs 
should be tailored to include risk factors that both college 
women and men encounter in common college so
cial interactions/situations. Moreover, the 
programs should be designed as continuing educational curriculums rather than brief, ﬁone 
shotﬂ doses since research suggests that th
e former approach is more helpful.  
6-5  The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study 
6.3 CSA Study Limitations 
Although the CSA Study method
ology was effective and effi
cient, and generated many 
interesting and useful findings, the study is not without limitations. First, the data are cross-
sectional in nature, which precludes us from knowing exactly how concepts relate to each 
other temporally, particularly with respect to ﬁr
isk factorsﬂ for sexual 
assault. For example, it appears that the frequency with which unde
rgraduate women get drunk
 is associated with 
their risk for being victims of sexual assault; however, it is 
possible that victims of sexual 
assault increase the frequency with which they got drunk as a result of the victimization, in 

which case frequency of getting drunk is not a 
risk factor for, but a consequence of, being 
sexually assaulted.  Another limitation of the CSA Study, inherent wi
th Web-based surveys, is that the response 
rates were relatively low. Although the respon
se rates were not lower than what most Web-
based surveys achieve, they ar
e lower than what we typically achieve using a different 
mode of data collection (e.g., face-to face-i
nterviewing). However, other modes of data 
collection are considerably more expensive and time consuming. Additionally, other modes 

would not have given respondents the same 
degree of anonymity and privacy and thus 
could have reduced data quality. Therefore, we feel that the trade-offs associated with low 

response rates are in many ways overcome by
 the benefits of cost
-efficiency and data 
quality (in terms of respondent anonymity an
d privacy, which are associated with more 
accurate reporting of sensitive behaviors). In addition, it is important to note that the 

nonresponse bias analyses that have been co
nducted to date have been encouraging and 
that we were able to weight the data to adjust
 for the observed nonresponse bias. It is also 
encouraging that the sexual assault preval
ence rates generated from this study are 
consistent with data from other univer
sity-based studies on sexual assault. A third limitation of the CSA Study, or at least a shortcoming worth pointing out, relates to 
the data we attempted to collect from ma
les on sexual assault victimization and 
perpetration. The response rate
s for males were disappointingly
 low, which creates concerns 
regarding the external validity of the data. Fu
rthermore, the self-reported rates of sexual 
assault perpetration were extremely low (particularly when
 compared with the limited previous studies that have ex
plored self-reported perpetration among university men), 
which makes us seriously doubt the validity of these data. Several explanations for the 
extremely low self-reported rate of sexual assault perpetration exist. First, perhaps 
perpetrators were much less likely than nonperpetrators to participate in the survey, which 

would result in artificially deflated estimate
s. Second, among the males who did participate 
in the survey, it is certainly possible that so
me did not respond honestly to the questions 
about sexual assault. Actual perpetrators may 
not have believed the 
answers they provided would remain anonymous and believed they mi
ght face serious consequences associated 
with reporting their criminal behavior. This possibility is somewhat discouraging. Given that 
the CSA Study methodology afforded responde
nts an exceptional amount of privacy and 
6-6  Section 6 Š Conclusion and Recommendations anonymity, the perpetration data cast some
 doubt on whether researchers can credibly 
collect data on perpetration of
 sexual assault via any methodology. Finally, although we 
used parallel wording for the victimization and perpetration questions, it is possible that 
men and women view certain sexual enco
unters differently. A woman might answer 
affirmatively to a question asking about whet
her she had experienced a particular type of 
unwanted sexual contact because someone 
used physical force or because she was 
incapacitated and unable to provide consent. In contrast, a man may view the same 

encounter as consensual and answer negatively
 to a question asking whether he has had 
sexual contact with someone by using physical
 force or when the person was incapacitated and unable to provide consent.  
It is also unclear whether the male data on vi
ctimization are accurate, because there is such 
limited prior research with which to compare 
the estimates. Given th
at the male component of the CSA Study was exploratory, we believe it was a worthwhile endeavor, but it is unclear 

whether we can draw any meaningful conc
lusions from the data collected from 
undergraduate males.  
6.4 Conclusion The CSA Study generated many useful data on se
xual assault that have not previously been 
presented in the literature. Sexual assault is a serious social, public safety, and public 
health problem that affects men and women ac
ross the country. University students may be 
at increased risk for sexual assault, particularly certain type
s of sexual assault. The CSA 
Study data suggest women at universities are at
 considerable risk fo
r experiencing sexual assault, especially AOD-enabled sexual assault, and that a number of personal and 
behavioral factors are associat
ed with increased risk. Univer
sities may be able to take 
several steps to reduce the prev
alence of sexual assault, as well as improve the resources 
for and response to sexu
al assault victims, by 
 better educating males and females about what constitutes sexual assault, how 
prevalent it is, when it is most likely 
to happen, and subgroups who may be at 
greatest risk;   including information about the use and abuse of alcohol and how it can increase 

one™s risk for sexual assault in a
ll prevention and education messages;  making sure all students are aware of th
e various resources available on and off 
campus to victims of sexual assault; 
 ensuring that crisis centers and law en
forcement have appropriate protocols and 
staff in place to deal with vi
ctims of sexual assault; and  educating students about what they should
 do if they witne
ss a sexual assault, experience a sexual assault, or have a friend who is sexually victimized. 
 6-7    7. FUTURE DIRECTIONS  
Several additional steps are planned for the CSA Study. Once the analyses on sexual assault 
victimization have been completed, we plan to use the CSA data for a variety of 
supplemental analyses. Specifically, we plan to 
explore in more detail the data on dating 
violence, examining gender differences in dating violence victimization and perpetration 
(both emotional and physical) and identifying risk factors for dating violence among our 
university sample. In addition, we anticipate that the participating universities will be 
particularly interested in the data on attitudes 
toward sexual assault. Therefore, we plan to 
identify particular subgroups of students (both male and fe
male) who might be appropriate 
targets for sexual assault prevention programming.
 Finally, we plan to fully explore the data 
on substance use, once again for the purpos
e of informing preventi
on programs at the 
participating universities. 
Beyond further analyses of the 
existing CSA Study data, we 
have identified several key 
future directions for our research. First, we feel that the su
ccessful implementation of the methodology pioneered for the CSA Study just
ifies the expansion of the CSA Study to 
additional universities. It would be of substantial value to field the CSA Study at universities 
in other regions of the country, as well as ot
her types of universities, such as private 
universities (or colleges) or historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The low cost 

and significant efficiency of the CSA Study methodology would make the replication at 
additional universities extremely feasible for 
minimal investment. Second, we plan to use 
the survey data to assist in developing sexual assault prevention programming at the 

participating universities. We have begun pr
eliminary prevention discussions with key 
officials at the universities and intend to further contribute to prevention messages that are 
grounded in empirical data reflecting actual experiences with sexual assault at the 
participating universities. We are also interest
ed in evaluating the pr
evention interventions developed and implemented as a 
result of the CSA Study.
