 Timed to Explode After MunichThe woman, Anne-Marie Murphy, who was arrested at Heathrow, has told the police that she did not know she was carrying a bomb.
 She had cleared airport security without difficulty.
 But El Al's security guards said Miss Murphy, who is Irish, looked different from the others checking in for Flight 016 to Tel Aviv, and they took extra care with her luggage.
 In previous news reports she had been described as looking Middle Eastern.In a false bottom of her bag, the airline's security guards found 10 pounds of plastic explosives, rolled paper-thin.
 The bomb was timed to explode while the 747 jumbo jet was airborne, after a stopover in Munich, West Germany, the police said today.The police, who are holding Miss Murphy and Mr. Hindawi at the maximum-security Paddington Green Police Station here under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, said they could not rule out the possibility Miss Murphy intended to leave the plane at Munich, but they said they believed she was probably an innocent dupe.According to her family, Miss Murphy had thought she was going to Israel to be married Saturday to Mr.
 Hindawi.
 ''I nearly died,'' Miss Murphy's mother, Cathleen Murphy, who has 10 children and lives in public housing near Dublin, said this morning.
 ''I got a terrible shock.
 My husband has been crying all night, but there is no doubt that she is innocent.
 ''I do not think very much of that boyfriend,'' she added.
 ''She is a lovely girl,'' said Ann Byrne, who added she had known Miss Murphy since she was born, ''but maybe a little too trusting.
 ''Other friends and relatives described her as quiet and a woman who rarely dated.
 She has been living in London for two years, working as a maid at the London Hilton in Park Lane.
 Today the hotel management also described her as quiet, hard-working and reliable.
 According to her family, Miss Murphy met Mr. Hindawi a year ago.
 ''She never said much about him,'' her mother said.
 Then six months ago, according to Miss Murphy's sister, Mary, Mr. Hindawi dropped out of her life.
 Not long ago, she said, ''he popped up out of the blue and asked for forgiveness.''
 'She Was Apprehensive'William Murphy said Mr. Hindawi gave his daughter $300 for a wedding dress and promised to marry her in Israel on Saturday.
 ''She was a bit apprenhensive,'' her sister said.
 ''But what else could she do?
 She was pregnant.
 ''At the airport, according to the police, Mr. Hindawi told his fiancee he had second thoughts about flying on an Israeli airline and would take a different airline.
 Instead, he left the airport.The police from Scotland Yard's antiterrorist squad said today that they thought Mr. Hindawi might have been a terrorist ''sleeper,'' planted in this country until the time came for him to act.
 High Security AlertA forensic examination of the bomb disclosed that it had a sophisticated micro-chip timing divice.
 If Mr. Hindawi assembled the bomb himself, the police said today, he would have needed detailed training.
 Their efforts to find him were spurred by a need to know if he might have been part of a cell planning further attacks.Heathrow Airport has been on a high security alert since earlier this week, after the American bombing raid on Libya.
 The raid, carried out by fighter bombers flying from British bases with the approval of the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, inevitably raised the prospect that Britain could become a target for terrorist reprisals.Mohammed Kabarday, 54 years old and deputy editor of Al Arab, an Arabic newspaper based in London, said today that he had briefly employed Mr. Hindawi as a copyboy and messenger four and a half years ago.
 At that time, Mr. Kabarday said, Mr. Hindawi had mentioned having a wife in Poland.
 ''We took him on as a copy messenger, and he wrote some sports reports, mainly football,'' Mr. Kabarday said.
 ''But his writing was mediocre.
 He was not popular here.
 He never had any interest in anything apart from himself.
 'Sacked After Second Month'''He was arrogant and belligerent, and I sacked him after his second month here.''Mr.
 Kabarday said Mr. Hindawi, who is 35, told him he had been born in a Jordanian village close to the Syrian border, where his father had once been the Mayor.
 Mr. Kabarday said the Hindawi family was well known in Jordanian politics and that two of Mr. Hindawi's uncles were former Cabinet ministers.On the day he told Mr. Hindawi his work was not satisfactory and he would not grant his request for a promotion, Mr. Kabarday said: ''He got bad tempered and locked up the teleprinter room and took the key home with him.
 I had to force the lock, and in the morning I sacked him.
 ''''I knew he wasn't a very pleasant person,'' Mr. Kabardy said as the manhunt was under way.
 ''But I didn't know he was that type of person.
 ''Terry Dicks, Conservative Member of Parliament whose constituency includes Heathrow, demanded tonight to know how the bomb passed the airport's X-ray inspection undiscovered.The police and airport security officials tried today to analyze the implications of the find.The bomb was found only because El Al requires its passengers to take all luggage to its gate and have it searched a second time, by hand.
 The police said the woman, who is pregnant, told them the man took her to Heathrow to board an El Al flight for Israel and gave her the bag with the bomb in it before he kissed her goodbye.
