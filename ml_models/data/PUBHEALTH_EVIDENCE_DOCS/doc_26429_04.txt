 Some estimates presented here come from sample data, and thus have sampling errors that may render some apparent differences between geographies statistically indistinguishable.
 Click the Quick Info  icon to the left of each row in TABLE view to learn about sampling error.
 The vintage year (e.g., V2019) refers to the final year of the series (2010 thru 2019).
 Different vintage years of estimates are not comparable.
 Fact Notes   (a)Includes persons reporting only one race  (b)Hispanics may be of any race, so also are included in applicable race categories  (c)Economic Census - Puerto Rico data are not comparable to U.S. Economic Census data  Value Flags   -Either no or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate, or a ratio of medians cannot be calculated because one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest or upper interval of an open ended distribution.
