 PAMs included inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, long-acting β-agonists, mast-cell stabilizers, and methylxanthines.Results: Among children with current asthma, there was an increase in the use of PAMs from 17.8% (SE: 3.3) in 1988–1994 to 34.9% (SE: 3.3) in 2005–2008 (P 0.6).
 Model fit, using Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test, was better when health insurance was used, so health insurance rather than income was included in the final analyses.Statistical AnalysisPrevalence estimates and SEs were calculated for use of any PAM, ≥2 PAMs, and each PAM class overall and by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and health insurance status.
 Trends by time period in the use of PAMs were tested using logistic regression models.
 In instances in which sufficient data were available for only 2 time periods, differences between time periods were tested with a Student’s t test.
 aORs and 95% CIs are reported.
 Because the prevalence of the outcome (use of PAM) was &gt;10%, the OR yielded by logistic regression overestimates relative risk.Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), and SUDAAN software version 10.0 (RTI, Research Triangle Park, NC) was used to account for the complex design of the survey.
 Sample weights, which account for differential probabilities of selection, nonresponse, and noncoverage, were used to obtain estimates representative of the noninstitutionalized US population.
