 QuickStats: Percentage of Adults Who Had Migraines or Severe Headaches, Pain in the Neck, Lower Back, or Face/Jaw,* by Sex --- National Health Interview Survey, 2009†  
 
       * For each type of pain, respondents were asked, "During the past three months, did you have [type of pain]?"
 Respondents were instructed to report pain that had lasted a whole day or more , and conversely, not to report fleeting or minor aches or pains.
 Persons might be represented in more than one pain category.
 † Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population and are derived from the National Health Interview Survey sample adult component.
 Estimates were age adjusted using the projected 2000 U.S. population as the standard population and the following age groups: 18--44 years, 45--64 years, 65--74 years, and ≥75 years.
 § 95% confidence interval.
 Females were more likely than males to have experienced a migraine or severe headache (21.8% versus 10.0%), pain in the neck (17.5% versus 12.6%), pain in the lower back (30.2% versus 26.0%), and pain in the face or jaw (6.6% versus 3.3%).
 For both sexes, pain in the lower back was the most common of these four types of pain, and pain in the face or jaw was the least common.
