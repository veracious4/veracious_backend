 Some banks that used the small-business lending fund to repay bailouts didn't increase lending at all, while others increased loans to small business by 25 cents for every $1 from the fund.
 At a time of economic distress, the aim was to help small businesses get capital that had become difficult for them to obtain.
 The loan program charged the community banks lower interest rates if they used the money for loans to small businesses.
 Only $4 billion was spent, according to the report by Special Inspector General Christy Romero.
 Of that, a total of $2.7 billion went to the 137 bailed-out banks, which used $2.1 billion of it to repay the higher-interest rescue aid they had received from the government.
 By repaying TARP funds, banks were able to escape limits on executive compensation and other restrictions.
 It said in a letter to Romero that banks that received TARP funds and tapped into the special lending fund \"significantly increased\" their small-business lending.
 Those banks shouldn't be compared only with banks that didn't receive bailouts and used the fund, Treasury said.
 That increase is about 40 percent of the total increase in small-business lending reported by all banks that tapped into the fund, it added.

 Florida voters voted on Tuesday to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour over six years, which advocates say will benefit hundreds of thousands of workers in the Sunshine State's service-heavy economy but which opponents say will stifle industry growth.
