WIC is a federally funded program that is administered at the 
federal level by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), United 
States Department of Agriculture. The State of Delaware, 
Division of Public Health, is responsible for the administration 
of the Delaware WIC Program. The WIC Administration of˜ ce is 
responsible for all the operations of the program in accordance 
with federal and state rules, regulations and guidelines.
The primary purpose of the WIC Program is to make health and 
nutrition services available to eligible individuals. 
Under the WIC Program, authorized health professionals 
prescribe nutritious supplemental foods and teach nutrition 
education to pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, 
infants, and children to their ˜ fth birthday.
WIC participants receive eWIC bene˜ ts (eWIC card) to enable 
them to purchase WIC approved foods at local retail grocery 
stores. The eWIC card has a prescription for speci˜ c foods 
selected for the nutritional need of the individual with amounts 
loaded to the eWIC card.
WIC participants will receive an eWIC card that includes:
- A list of speci˜ c foods that may be purchased.
- A Cash Value Bene˜ t (CVB) that has a ˜ xed-dollar amount 
for the purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Participants can use their bene˜ ts at any Delaware WIC 
authorized retailer.
WHAT IS WIC?
WIC vendors play an important role in the health of WIC participants. eWIC cards contain a food prescription designed to 
supplement the WIC participant™s nutritional needs. The vendor fills the prescription, ensuring that the participant receives what 
is prescribed. Vendors act as the final step in the WIC process. The vendor™s role is vital to the success of the WIC program 
because the nutritious WIC foods are designed to promote the healthiest possible birth outcomes, as well as the growth and 
development of children. WIC appreciates you being a partner with us in providing nutritious foods to Delaware families!

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q: Can I substitute another brand if our store is out of the brand on the WIC Program Booklet?
A:No. Substitutions are never allowed. If your store is out of the specific brand the participant wants, the 
participant can go to a different WIC authorized vendor.
Q: Does the WIC Participant have to show ID/WIC folder for an eWIC transaction?
A:No. The eWIC card is the only item required for a successful eWIC transaction.
Q: What if my store is out of a WIC food item?
A:If your store is out of an authorized WIC food item, you must tell the WIC customer to come back later or go to 
another store. You may not issue rain checks or IOUs for out-of-stock items.
Q: What should a cashier do if a situation arises at checkout?
A:Contact your store manager or customer service manager, according to your store policy.
LET THE WIC SYSTEM DECIDE
The Point-of-Sale (POS) device will determine if the item 
is allowed. If it is an allowed item, and the customer has 
enough in their balance to receive the item, the POS will 
allow the transaction.
