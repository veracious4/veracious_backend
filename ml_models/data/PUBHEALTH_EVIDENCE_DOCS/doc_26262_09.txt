 on 
Activities of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts
 for 
201
9 Introduction
 Under 
50 U.S.C. § 1873
(a)
(2)
, 
enacted as part of the USA 
FREEDOM
 Act of 2015 (Pub. L. No. 114
-23), the 
Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO) is required to publish sta
tistical 
information on certain activities 
of
 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)
 and Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review 
(FISCR) 
(collectively referred to as the FISA courts) 
as 
detailed 
in 50 U.S.C. § 1873
(a)
(1)
. This includes 
the number of applications or certifications submitted to the 
FISC
 and whether those requests were granted, modified, or denied
. It also includes information on amicus 
curiae 
appointments
 by the FISA courts
. This is the Director™s report for calendar year 201
9. Summary of Findings
 The FISC disclosed that it received 1,
010
 applications
 in 201
9. After consideration by the court, 
688
 orders were granted, 
264 orders were modified, 
38 orders were denie
d in part, 
and 
20 applications 
were denied
 in full
. After completing the declassification review specified in 50 U.S.C. § 1873(a)(1), th
e U.S. Department of Justice
 advised the AO that the number of certifications 
submitted and the numb
er 
of orders 
modified
 under 
50 U.S.C. 
§ 1881a
 are classified for national security reasons and so 
are
 not 
included in these totals.
  Two
 appointments of
 a total of 
two
 individuals to serve as amicus curiae were 
made by the FISA courts during this period.
 Explanation of 
Selected 
Terms
 More detailed statistics 
appear 
in the table
 below. 
An explanation of selected terms is provided as a 
reference t
o 
help readers 
understand
 what is included and excluded in the 
stated 
totals
. Applications or Certifications
  The reported numbers 
include:
 (1)  applications or certifications that were filed in signed, final form pursuant to Rule 9(b) of the 
FISC Rules of Procedure; and
 (2)  prop
osed applications or certifications (submitted pursuant to Rule 9(a) of the FISC Rules of 
Procedure) for which the government decided not to submit a corresponding signed, final 

application or certification pursuant to Rule 9(b) after being advised that th
e Court, based on its 
assessment of the proposed application or certification, would not grant the application or 
certification as proposed by the government.
 The reported numbers do not include motions or other requests for relief made after the Court act
ed on 

the application or certification in that docket.
    -2-  Orders Granted
 The rep
orted numbers 
include orders granted without substantive modifications to the orders proposed 
by the government. They do not include any action taken by the Court in response to motions or other 
requests for relief made after the Court acted on the application or certif
ication in 
a docket.
 Orders Modified
 The repo
rted numbers 
include:
 (1) 
 any substantive modifications to proposed orders that accompanied a signed, final 
application or certification submitted by the government pursuant to Rule 9(b), including when 
such mo
difications were 
affected
 through a supplemental order issued by the Court; and
 (2) 
 any substantive modifications to proposed orders that accompanied proposed applications 
or certifications submitted by the government pursuant to Rule 9(a) when such modif
ications 
resulted from the Court™s assessment of such a submission, including when such modifications 

were subsequently reflected in a proposed order that accompanied a signed, final application or 
certification submitted by the government pursuant to Rule
 9(b)
.   The following Court actions are among those that would be regarded as substantive modifications to an 

order:  
 (1)
 imposing a new reporting requirement or modifying one proposed
 by the government;
  
(2)
 changing the description or specif
ication of a target
ed person, 
of 
a facility to be subjected to 
electronic surveillance or of property to be searched;
  (3)
 modifying the minimization procedures proposed by the government; or
  (4)
 shortening the duration of some or all of the authorities requested.
 The numbers of mo
dification in the table below 
do not
 include dispositions in which the Court granted in 
part and denied in part
 the authorizations requested by the government by approving some targets, 
some facilities, places, premises, property 
or specific selection term
s, and/or some forms of collection
, but not others
. As discussed below, these modifications are reported separately as partial denials of the 
relief sought in the application o
r certification.
 The reported numbers of orders modified 
likewise 
do not include:
 (1) any actions taken by the Court in response to motions or other requests for relief made after 
the Court acted on the application or certification in that docket; or 
 (2) any modifications
 made by the government to an application or certification that it had 
submitted pursuant to Rule 9(a) or Rule 9(b) 
Œ as opposed to modifications to the proposed 
orders submitted therewith
.   -3- In some instances, 
the 
Court examination resulted in the 
governme
nt making material changes 
to applications and certifications
; for e
xample, 
proffer
ing
 additional facts to support a required 
judicial finding of probable cause or to address minimization concerns
. Consistent with the 
statutory mandate in 50 U.S.C. § 1873(
a), however, 
the number reported in this category 
includes 
only cases in which there were substantive modifications to the government™s 
proposed orders.
 Orders Denied in Part
 As noted above, 
consistent with the Director™s 
report
s since 2016
, partial denials of the relief sought by 
the government are captured separately under the heading ﬁOrders Denied in Part.ﬂ These are 
dispositions in which the Court granted in part and denied in part the authorizations requested by the 

government by appro
ving some targets, some facilities, places, premises, property 
or specific selection 
terms
, and/or some forms of collection, but not others. 
 Applications or Certifications Denied
 The reported numbers 
include:
 (1) any cases
 in which the Court denied in its
 entirety a final, signed application or certification 
submitted by the government pursuant to Rule 9(b);
 (2) any case
s in which the government withdrew a final, signed application or certification it had 
submitted pursuant to Rule 9(b) after being advised
 that the Court would not grant the 
application or certification as submitted by the government; and
 (3) any case
s in which the government decided not to submit a final, signed application or 
certification pursuant to Rule 9(b) after being advised that the Court, based on its assessment of 

the corresponding proposed application or certification submitted pursuant to R
ule 9(a), would 
not grant the application or certification as proposed by the government.

 the reporting requirements specified in 50 U.S.C. § 1873

of the statistics reported herein differ from those in 
comparable reports prepared by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Director of National

applications and certifications filed pursuant to Rule 9(b).

espectively, are 
included in this row and are not separately reflected in the rows addressing requests for authority to conduct el
ectronic surveillance (Section 
1805) and physical search (Section 1824) above. 
 ⁄ After completing the declassification review specified in 50 U.S.C. § 1873(a)(1), the U.S. Department of Justice has advised 
the 
AO
 that these
 number
s are
 currently classifie
d for national security reasons.
  Amicus Curiae
 50 U.S.C. §
 1803(i)(2)
 authorizes the 
FISA courts 
to appoint individuals to serve as am
ici curiae
. Under 50 
U.S.C. §
 1803(i)(2)(A), a 
FISA 
court must appoint an individual to serve as amic
us
 curiae to assist the 
court in the consideration of any application for an order or review that, in the opinion of the court, 
presents a novel or significant interpretation of the law, unless the court iss
ues a finding that such 
appointment is not appropriate
. Furthermore, a 
FISA 
court may appoint an individual or organization to 
serve as amicus curiae in any instance as such court deems appropriate or, upon motion, permit an 
individual or organization leav
e to file an amicus curiae brief
. 50 U.S.C. §
 1803(i)(2)(B).
 For purposes of reporting under 50 U.S.C. § 1873(a)(1)
(E), each instance of an individual receiving an 
appointment is counted separately, such as when more than one individual is appointed in the
 same 
matter, or when the same individual is appointed by the FISC and the FISCR at different stages of the 
same case
. During the reporting period, 
there were 
two
 appointment
s of
 individual
s to serve as amic
i curiae 
by the 
FISA courts
.  The names of the in
dividuals appointed 
during the reporting period 
to serve as amic
i curiae 
are as follows: 
David Kris and Ben Johnson
. No findings were made in 201
9, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 
1803(i)(2)(A), that an amicus curiae appointment was not appropriate. 
    -5- Consistent 
with the Director™s report 
for
 2017
 and 2018
, this report specially notes i
nstances in which 
the Court 
advised 
the government 
that it was considering
 appoint
ment of
 an amicus
 curiae to address 
a novel or significant 
question of law
 raised in 
a proposed application
, but the government 
ultimately
 did 
not proceed with the proposed application or 
modif
ied
 the final application such that 
it did not present 
a novel or significant 
question of law
, thereby 
obviating 
a requirement 
for 
consideration as to
 the 
appropriateness of 
appointment of
 amicus
. There w
ere two
 such instance
s in 201
9, 
which 
are reflected 
in the table above as a 
full
 denial 
and modification of the applications at issue, respectively.
