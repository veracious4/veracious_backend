 pic.twitter.com/3VwzN3d0pE— Everything Georgia (@GAFollowers) August 4, 2020The photograph spread even further when it was posted to the Facebook group “The Other 98%” with the caption, “Not a mask in sight and ZERO social distancing.
 If this is what [Donald] Trump &amp; Betsy DeVos meant by opening schools safely then God help us all.” The group’s post was shared more than 10,000 times on that platform.Etowah High officials have not publicly addressed the class photograph, but a spokesperson for its own governing body, the Cherokee County School District, told WXIA-TV that “masks are not mandated for students — they are strongly encouraged and recommended.
 The fact that masks would not be mandated for students is known to all CCSD parents, as it has been repeatedly communicated to them since the reopening plan was announced July 8.”The district further told Associated Press that officials only heard about the class photograph after it spread online, since it was not an official school function.The photograph’s spread mirrored that of another photo taken inside a school in Paulding County, about 30 miles away from Etowah High, with both going viral amid a slight decrease statewide in the amount of positive tests for COVID-19 as well as newly confirmed cases.AP also reported that the state hit a new weekly high mark for deaths on August 4 2020, with an average of 51 deaths from the disease across the prior week.Comments eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'truthorfiction_com-medrectangle-1','ezslot_6',127,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'truthorfiction_com-medrectangle-1','ezslot_7',127,'0','1']));eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'truthorfiction_com-medrectangle-1','ezslot_8',127,'0','2']));Article Sources +Neither Masks nor Social Distancing Required | First Look Inside Georgia's SchoolsBack-to-School Photo Shows Unmasked Students Crowding Shoulder-to-Shoulder in GeorgiaImages of Student Crowds Raise Questions in Georgia SchoolsShareShareRedditWhatsAppEmailTweetPost navigation← Previous PostNext Post → Help Fight Misinformation.
