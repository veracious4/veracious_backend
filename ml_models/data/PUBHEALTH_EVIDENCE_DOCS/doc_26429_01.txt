 EEven with a virus that doesn’t respect borders, vulnerability is spread unevenly.
 And some of the largest disparities seen so far have involved race and ethnicity.
 Early data of the Covid-19 crisis, broken down by race, is alarming.
 In the US, in Chicago, as of early April 2020, 72% of people who died of coronavirus were black, although only one-third of the city’s population is.
 In Georgia, as of 17 April, white people accounted for 40% of Covid-19 cases where race was reported, although they represent 58% of the state.
 In the UK, of the first 2,249 patients with confirmed Covid-19, 35% were non-white.
 This is much higher than the proportion of non-white people in England and Wales – 14%, according to the most recent census.

 How the new coronavirus might change the world  Given the long history of unequal health outcomes, these patterns shouldn’t be surprising.
 The pandemic is the latest example of how racial dynamics play out in complex – and still not entirely understood – ways.
 Income inequality  In many majority-white countries like the US (as well as some minority-white countries like South Africa), people from other ethnic and racial groups have less access to economic resources – whether that means high-earning jobs or a full pantry.
 That economic vulnerability often translates to poorer health outcomes.Black US households in 2018 were twice as likely to be food insecure as the national average, with one in five families lacking consistent access to enough foodTake food insecurity, defined as a household not having the resources to ensure consistent access to enough food.
 Even pre-pandemic, 91.1% of South African households considered vulnerable to hunger were headed by a black person, compared to 1.3% for households headed by a white person (though whites make up 7.9% of the population).
 In Canada, 48% of First Nations households faced food insecurity even before Covid-19 made it harder to keep fisheries open.
 And in the US, black households in 2018 were twice as likely to be food insecure as the national average, with one in five families lacking consistent access to enough food, even before the crisis caused massive layoffs and squeezed foodbanks.People wait in line at a food bank in Van Nuys, California, where organisers said they had distributed food for 1,500 families amid the spread of Covid-19 (Credit: Getty Images)There are a number of consequences of lacking access to consistent nutrition, including higher risk of underlying health conditions.
 In the US, for example, African Americans are more likely than white residents to have diabetes, heart disease and hypertension – which weaken lungs and immune systems.
 And people with pre-existing health conditions are more likely to develop severe Covid-19 symptoms.
 Of course, this doesn’t just mean certain groups are more vulnerable to Covid-19.
 It also means they’re more vulnerable to its economic consequences.
 In South Africa, for example, development economist at the University of Witwatersrand Imraan Valodia has forecast that the lockdown will lead to a 45% loss of income for the poorest 10% of households, with especially harmful effects on informal workers without a safety net.
 As a result, he is calling for an end to the lockdown (one alternative could be a curfew).
 “For the upper classes who can continue to earn an income and who have wealth to fall back on, the lockdown is easy to manage.
 For the lower classes, this is not the case,” Valodia says.
 Other racial disparities But economic inequality isn’t the only challenge disproportionately faced by BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) groups.
 Persistent environmental injustice, for example, means that disproportionately high numbers of ethnic-minority households in North America and Europe live near incinerators and landfills, and schools with high proportions of minority students are located near highways and industrial sites – for both economic and non-economic reasons.
 This too affects vulnerability to lung-inflaming conditions like asthma and Covid-19.
 “Air quality, which early data is highlighting to be a potential risk factor for Covid-19, is also a risk factor for respiratory health,” says Grania Brigden, who leads the tuberculosis department at the lung health organisation The Union.An army sergeant speaks to a patient at the Javits New York Medical Station, which supports local hospitals in New York City (Credit: Getty Images)There are healthcare disparities as well.
 In the US, for example, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans and African Americans are less likely than whites and Asian Americans to have health insurance.
 Racial biases also play a role.
 US surveys have found that medical staff are more uncertain and less communicative with non-white patients than with whites.
 Meanwhile, one 2016 study found that white medical students were surprisingly likely to believe that black patients experience less pain than white people – all the more disturbing given their expected understanding of biology.
 These kinds of beliefs and patterns can translate into less effective medical care for black patients, regardless of the patient’s income or educational status.‘Weathering’ refers to the accumulated physiological burden from the stresses caused by racism and race-related disadvantage, such as the frequent secretion of stress hormonesThen there is racism itself.
 Allostatic load (or “weathering”) refers to the accumulated physiological burden from the stresses caused by racism and race-related disadvantage, such as the frequent secretion of stress hormones.
 While weathering is more severe for people with low socioeconomic status, studies suggest that it affects the health deterioration and mortality of higher-income African Americans (especially women) as well, including their newborns.
 Even medical staff themselves may not be shielded from these effects: investigation is ongoing into why the first 10 doctors in the UK reported to have died from Covid-19 were all BAME.
 Occupational factors Meanwhile, around the world, certain racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately represented in at-risk professions.
 For instance, 26.4% of Transport for London staff are from BAME groups (vs. the 14% for all of England and Wales).
 People of colour are also substantially more likely to be unemployed, underemployed or precariously employed, which makes them especially likely to undertake hazardous temporary or gig economy work like delivering food.A police official warns labourers to wear face masks at the grain market in Chandigarh, India (Credit: Getty Images)In the US, farmworkers are often undocumented migrants from Latin America with little control over safe working conditions.
 It can be difficult to ensure physical distancing in the fields, isolation in the farmworker camps, or proximity to medical facilities.
 Farmworkers in the US have high rates of diabetes and pesticide exposure, stressing their immune systems and thus making them more vulnerable to infectious diseases.
 Wael Elamin, a medical microbiologist at King’s College Hospital in Dubai, points out that migrant workers also face overcrowded living conditions in a number of Middle Eastern countries that depend on their labour.
 In general, undocumented people are especially unlikely to seek formal medical care out of fear of being reported to law enforcement.
 This influenced Portugal’s decision to grant temporary residency rights to asylum seekers and other migrants whose residency applications were pending: minimising that fear would help public health.
 It’s still too early to know whether this decision has paid off, but public health agencies have praised the move.
 Housing differences Overcrowding also is likelier to affect lower-income groups across the globe, from Native American families to displaced Rohingyas.
 With a disease as infectious as Covid-19, it’s easy to see how that could translate to poorer outcomes.
 In a Population Council phone survey of five informal settlements in Nairobi, for example, 85% of respondents reported that they had no place in their home to isolate an ill person, 82% would be unable to stay at home for 14 days (mainly due to the loss of income), and 37% would have difficulty washing their hands frequently due to a lack of water.One survey found that 26% of Bangladeshi British households have more people than bedrooms, compared to just 2% of white British householdsIn the UK, meanwhile, one survey found that 26% of Bangladeshi British households, and 21% of black African ones, have more people than bedrooms.
 The same is true of just 2% of white British households.
 Bangladeshi, Indian and Chinese households in the UK also have higher rates of elderly people living with children – a clear vector for passing on Covid-19 to the most vulnerable age group.
 Precarious housing is another challenge, as people who are homeless or vulnerably housed are less able to observe social distancing and self-isolation.
 In the UK, at least 31% of homeless households prioritised for assistance are non-white (although, as we’ve seen, non-whites make up just 14% of the overall population of England and Wales).
 Demolitions of shack settlements have continued in Durban, South Africa despite the public health crisis.
 Nigerians are being targeted for eviction in Guangzhou, China.
 And black women in Milwaukee and other US cities are much more likely than white residents to rent their homes (and to be evicted from them, although evictions have been suspended in Milwaukee County in response to the crisis).In Rio de Janeiro, a person who is homeless eats food provided by residents of the Chapeu Mangueira slum during the Covid-19 outbreak (Credit: Getty Images)It’s important to remember that residential segregation isn’t simply a by-product of income inequality.
 It’s also a result of systematic and widespread housing discrimination on the basis of race, caste and other identity-linked factors.
 Cultural factors At the same time, the crisis is amplifying misinformation and biases against specific groups.
 It has boosted Islamophobia in India, thanks in part to “corona jihad” rumours on social media about Muslims deliberately coughing and sneezing on others.
 The US has also seen rumours, especially during the early part of the epidemic, about black people being somehow immune to the virus – a myth that persists across Africa as well.
 Biases also mean some are less likely to take preventative behaviour like wearing masks.
 Black men in the US have reported being uncomfortable wearing masks in public: racial bias and profiling means they’re more likely to be seen as a criminal or dangerous, rather than as simply protecting their own health.
 Then there is the impact on Asians and Asian Americans.Members of the Asian American Commission hold a press conference condemning racism towards the Asian American community during the Covid-19 crisis (Credit: Getty Images)Cynthia Choi is one of the executive directors of Chinese for Affirmative Action.
 This organisation, along with the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, launched the Stop AAPI Hate website on 19 March 2020.
 The site collects reports of harassment and assault of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the US, including incidents of Asian Americans being physically assaulted and coughed and spat on.
 Most of the people targeted in these incidents have been women.Asians and Pacific Islanders are becoming increasingly fearful of being harassed or attacked – Cynthia Choi“AAPIs are becoming increasingly fearful of being harassed or attacked going to work, walking in their neighbourhoods and going to public places,” Choi says, based on the incident descriptions received by Stop AAPI Hate.
 Language barriers Even language has had a marginalising effect on some groups around the world.
 Much of the initial public health guidance around Covid-19 has been in dominant languages, points out Salman Waqar, an academic GP registrar at the University of Oxford and the general secretary of the British Islamic Medical Association.
 “There needed to be a better understanding at the beginning of this pandemic that these messages may not necessarily get through to the grassroots,” he says.
 Indeed, terms like “social distancing” and messages about safety measures have been difficult to translate into a number of languages.Urban art depicting the importance of face masks, part of a Covid-19 campaign, is pictured with the Arabic hashtag ‘Stay aware’ in Khartoum (Credit: Getty Images)You only need to look at the Ebola outbreak that started in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018 to see what effect this can have, notes Ellie Kemp, head of crisis response for Translators without Borders.
 For instance, official communications from the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization likely started out in either English or French, then were translated into a non-local version of Swahili, with key terms like “swab” remaining in French.
 “One of the net results of the confusion that caused was that people didn’t really trust the information,” Kemp says.
 Women and less educated people, especially, “didn’t understand the language used by the doctors and the medical staff.
 And so they didn’t feel they were able to make themselves understood.” Many chose not to seek medical care, or were misdiagnosed.
 “There’s this terrible coincidence between people who are likely to have less health literacy to start with, and people who are less likely to speak an international language,” Kemp says.
 She remembers widespread puzzlement about the term “contact tracing”.
 People didn’t know what a “contact” meant – was it someone in your phone book?
 Sexual contact?
 The phrase was ultimately translated into a Swahili version of “monitoring people who’ve been close to a sick person” – a term that was easier to understand.
 Narrowing the gaps Experts say that addressing these disparities in the short term will require steps that will help everyone, but especially people of colour: getting protective equipment to all essential workers, including janitors and sanitation workers; increasing access to medical care, whether in private or public facilities; providing secure housing for people who fall ill; increasing financial support to both individuals and nonprofit organisations; and ensuring the basics, like handwashing stands and soap, in the areas with the fewest resources, including informal settlements and refugee camps.A boy washes at the Dibege Refugee Camp in Iraq; ensuring that there are handwashing stands and soap is key to fighting Covid-19’s spread in refugee camps (Credit: Getty Images)Getting vitamin D supplements to vulnerable groups, including darker-skinned people, could help with immune response in general (although there isn’t a consensus about how widespread vitamin D supplementation should be, and in which amounts).
 There’s also an urgent need for more data, broken down by demographic groups, to know how to best serve different communities.
 But this has been stymied by political obstacles in some countries, and insufficient resources in others.
 As of 14 April 2020, only 22% of Covid-19 cases reported in the US specified the race of the patient.
 And microbiologist Elamin points out that in Sudan, it’s challenging to collect medical data on whether, for instance, respiratory illnesses recorded in December 2019 and January 2020 could have been cases of Covid-19.
 Gathering more specific demographic information on population groups most affected would be even tougher and more sensitive.
 Attention to the medium and longer term will also be needed.
 The pandemic highlights and exacerbates health inequities, but it doesn’t create them.
 Nor will the disparities end with the emergency.The pandemic has highlighted, even in higher-income countries, the importance of a strong and well-funded health system that is available to all – Grania Brigden As a result, say experts, policy discussions around social protection and universal healthcare are more important now than ever.
 According to lung health expert Brigden, the pandemic “has highlighted, even in higher-income countries, the importance of a strong and well-funded health system that is available to all”.
 The world also needs an acceleration of environmental regulations that reduce air pollution (which particularly weakens respiratory health among marginalised communities); the US is currently seeing a rollback, instead.A roadside tailor stitches cloths in heavy smog in New Delhi, India; air pollution is linked to weakened respiratory health (Credit: Getty Images)And there needs to be a careful look at how economic fallout will disproportionately impact BAME communities.
 For example, after the 2007-08 financial crisis, ethnic minorities in the UK faced higher unemployment, lower earnings and higher housing costs.
 “What’s going to kill us more: the bug, or the poverty that’s associated with the bug?” asks microbiologist Elamin.
 For now, it’s impossible to answer.
 But what is clear regarding coronavirus is that, as he says, “the way it spreads is not equal”.
 But there is a best-case scenario.
 And that is that the current pandemic will galvanise more, and longer-lasting, attention to the social, political and economic structures that shape how different people experience the pandemic – and spur action so that, in the future, a factor like an individual’s race or ethnicity will have less impact on the risk to their lives.

 (Importantly, though, the researchers couldn&rsquo;t rule out that transmission on rows was higher because people sitting adjacent are more likely to be family and friends, already in close contact.
 After two hours, a distance of less than 2.5m, without a mask, was insufficient to prevent transmission, the researchers found.

 Their objection is not just about comfort, or even scepticism that they can save lives.
 It&rsquo;s also resentment about being told what to do by authorities.
 Except the interviewees above were not upset about laws that have made face masks mandatory in public spaces in many countries.
 But the introduction of seat belt laws was far less straightforward than the requirement to wear face masks.
 It was messy, fraught and slow.
 Why, for instance, does there seem to be differences between the adoption of the rules in different countries?
 Car manufacturers, insurance companies, law enforcement, politicians and drivers all had vested interests in seat belt laws.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the car manufacturers, the issue was cost.
 At the time they were hopeful that seat belts would become mandatory because they were much cheaper to fit than airbags &ndash; the other technology for which lobbyists were campaigning.

 A passive airbag would mean officers could avoid traffic stops.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the pro-seatbelt bloc faced off the pro-airbag bloc.
 In some countries, the gap between their first introduction for front-seat drivers and back-seat passengers was decades.
 Japan, for example, first made seat belts mandatory in the driver&rsquo;s seat in 1971, but for back-seat passengers it took until 2008 to become law.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe laws were also introduced in certain countries and states before others, meaning you could drive across state lines in the US, be required to wear your seat belt when you set off, but be able to take it off during your journey.
 In the US, there are three states (Illinois, Iowa and New Hampshire) where helmets are not mandatory for motorcyclists of any age, but they border states where all riders must wear one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe cultural context\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Illinois, another state to introduce new seat belt laws in 1985, not wearing a seat belt was considered a petty offence when first introduced, punishable with a fine of up to $25 (almost &pound;50 adjusting for inflation).
 The modest fine was supposed to reassure motorists that the law was not to be strictly enforced.
 The statute even went one step further by stating that violating the seat belt law could not be considered negligence, which meant insurers would still have to pay out if a driver had injured themselves while not wearing one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet, four motorists who were charged under the new law tried to challenge its constitutionality in court.
 There was precedence: when Illinois introduced laws requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets in 1969, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled it an unconstitutional restriction of personal liberty &ndash; a ruling which still stands today.
 Data collected by federal officials in New York suggested that 70% of front-seat motorists were adhering to the law two months later.
 In the UK, about 90% of front-seat motorists were observed to be following the law after a similar amount of time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the laws in both countries were updated in the early 1990s to include back-seat adult passengers, the effect was less noticeable.
 In the late 1980s, Serbia (then Yugoslavia) had one of the highest rates of road deaths in Europe.
 But, Yugoslavians still rarely wore their seat belts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is clear that the level of protesting and the number of legal challenges did not necessarily equate to adoption of the new law or regulation.
 While it meant they often avoided a fine, they were not wearing the belt for its intended purpose.
 If there was no intention on the part of the drivers to wear the belt properly then why go to court?
 And there was no restriction on their personal liberties if the belt could be worn incorrectly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile courts were widely used in Yugoslavia, they were used for personal benefit not to pursue political or symbolic point-scoring.
 In the US, the reverse was true.
 Challenging a fine in court would have been far more expensive than paying the modest fee, and few people were fined anyway.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is perhaps the most useful lesson from comparing seat belt laws and face mask adoption: the amount of protesting is immaterial and is probably influenced by how much people in a country respect authority and the legal process.
 The messaging and the legal framework that allows the laws to be enforced has to be right.
 But time will force people to conform.

 &ldquo;When you have olive oil on your fingers when you&rsquo;re cooking, it&rsquo; very hard to get rid of it with just water,&rdquo; he says.

 Many people consistently underestimate how fast the value increases &ndash; a mistake known as the &ldquo;exponential growth bias&rdquo; &ndash; and while it may seem abstract, it may have had profound consequences for people&rsquo;s behaviour this year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA spate of studies has shown that people who are susceptible to the exponential growth bias are less concerned about Covid-19&rsquo;s spread, and less likely to endorse measures like social distancing, hand washing or mask wearing.

 Most savings accounts offer compound interest, for example, where you accrue additional interest on the interest you have already earned.
 This is a classic example of exponential growth, and it means that even low interest rates pay off handsomely over time.

 More importantly, the team found that those beliefs were directly linked to the participants&rsquo; views on the best ways to contain the spread.
 It&rsquo;s common for the number of infections to be presented on a &ldquo;logarithmic scale&rdquo;, in which the figures on the y-axis increase by a power of 10 (so the gap between 1 and 10 is the same as the gap between 10 and 100, or 100 and 1000).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this makes it easier to plot different regions with low and high growth rates, it means that exponential growth looks more linear than it really is, which could reinforce the exponential growth bias.

 When Lammers and colleagues reminded the participants of the exponential growth bias, and asked them to calculate the growth in regular steps over a two week period, people hugely improved their estimates of the disease&rsquo;s spread &ndash; and this, in turn, changed their views on social distancing.
 Emphasising the short amount of time that it will take to reach a large number of cases, for instance &ndash; and the time that would be gained by social distancing measures &ndash; improves people&rsquo;s understanding of accelerating growth, rather than simply stating the percentage increase each day.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELammers believes that the exponential nature of the virus needs to be made more salient in coverage of the pandemic.

 &ldquo;[Recessions] are always looming,&rdquo; says Caroline Bentham, a PhD candidate at the University of Leeds, UK.
 Countries like the UK, US, France and Germany have had two or three each since the start of the 1990s.
 But other advanced economies like Italy, Japan, Portugal and Greece have reached half a dozen &ldquo;recession episodes&rdquo; in the same time.
 Globally, economies are in recession 10-12% of the time.
 The same working paper from the IMF found that private sector and official state economists were equally bad at predicting recession years.
 The authors put this down to a reluctance from economists to read good or bad news correctly.
 &ldquo;At the moment everyone is sort of smiling at each other and pretending that we&rsquo;re not in a recession.
 They&rsquo;re thinking, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s hope we can get out quick when it happens&rsquo;.
 But it is hard to tell at the moment because we are in the eye of the storm,&rdquo; says Bentham.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGood or bad?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBentham previously worked at the Bank of England and before that at EY, one of the &ldquo;Big Four&rdquo; accounting firms, where she worked on tightening regulation to make banks more resilient in direct response to the 2008 financial crash.
 She says that banks are much better set up to handle a financial crisis than a decade ago.
 &ldquo;The 2008 recession was about the housing market and shares, which hit disproportionately higher income groups,&rdquo; says Carol Propper, a professor of economics at Imperial College London.
 &ldquo;At present the crisis seems to be hitting very much the lower income groups; the vulnerable workers, young and less skilled.
 This looks like the late-70s, early-80s recession, which affected young and unskilled workers.
 What we know about those workers is that coming into a labour market has long shadows for those vulnerable workers, but not for skilled workers.
 It affects the whole life-long trajectory for those unskilled workers in the labour market.&rdquo; So while the financial sector might be better off in this recession because of the lessons learned a decade ago, the least wealthy people might suffer much more.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are other lessons from 2008, too.
 Despite the impression that recessions lead to significant numbers of job losses, this isn&rsquo;t always the case.
 People who were laid off in the Great Recession were unemployed for a long time but layoffs were concentrated among a small number of people.
 In the UK and US, unemployment had dropped to below pre-recession figures by 2014, meaning fewer people were out of jobs as those countries came out of the crisis than before they went in.
 In the Eurozone, employment statistics took much longer to recover.
 In Germany, employment went up over this period but on average across the whole zone it stayed fairly constant &ndash; this is in part due to migration.
 While shops and businesses were closed, the total value generated by goods and services decreased.
 This has the knock-on effect of the people employed by those businesses earning less money &ndash; either a fraction of their salary or nothing at all if they were made redundant.

 The justification is that it is easier for a company to get up and running quickly with trained staff ready to go than it is to retrain new staff.
 &ldquo;People are taking mortgage holidays, credit holidays &ndash; it just means the losses are being pushed further down the road.

 Eventually the financial sector bubble of confidence will burst and we will see real turmoil again.

 Cinemas, for example, need to draw customers in with blockbuster movies.

 Or to wait for social distancing rules to relax so that cinema capacities can increase.
 &ldquo;In this case, stimulating the economy is good because the problem is lack of demand,&rdquo; says Veronica Guerrieri, a professor of economics at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
 This is a supply shock.
 It increases their purchasing power.
 Inflation is currently 0.65% (dipping as low as 0.12% in May) in the US and 0.8% in the UK, much lower than in recent years, but this could change should the governments&rsquo; stimulus packages cause supply shocks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESupply shocks, by contrast, happen when people still have money to spend but cannot do so, because shops are closed or prices have rocketed up.
 For example, when oil prices go up, the cost to produce products manufactured with oil increases, and those costs are passed onto the customer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause the current recession is such a complicated mix of supply and demand shocks brought about by furloughing and suspending work in certain sectors, but not in others, it&rsquo;s harder to predict how government interventions will work based on previous recessions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;This is why people were debating whether expansionary policy would be good or not,&rdquo; says Guerrieri.

 Then she opens her mouth to blast out a brief segment of an operatic aria.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs she does so, a fine mist of tiny water droplets burst forth from her airways, the bright lights off to one side making their swirling movements visible.
 With each word she articulates, the cloud of droplets surges forward rapidly before twisting lazily in the air a metre or so in front of her.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mist is a simulated aerosol, composed of water vapour she breathed in moments before she started to sing.
 But the plumes of aerosol coming from her mouth and nose are being closely monitored with high-speed cameras set up by Matthais Echternach, head of phoniatrics and paediatric audiology at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Hospital Munich, and Stefan Kniesburges, a fluid mechanics expert at the University Hospital Erlangen.
 Larger droplets &ndash; more like little globules of spit &ndash; fly forward and downwards to land on surfaces about 1.5m away.
 Rather than billowing in front of her, the plume is stunted.
 Jets of aerosol spurt upwards out of gaps where the mask sits over her nose, and out of the sides.
 Although it is clear the virus might still escape into the air in a mask like this, the amount of aerosol carrying it is greatly reduced.
 )\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;There were none of the larger droplets when wearing the mask,&rdquo; says Echternach.
 &ldquo;Aerosols are more problematic, if the mask is not tight fitting, they will find the easiest way out and escape through the masks.
 But all struggled to sing with the mask on &ndash; as most of us who have worn even home-made masks in recent months will know, breathing is harder and the fabric can muffle the voice.
 \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Singing with a mask on is almost impossible,&rdquo; says Echternach, who is also a trained singer himself.
 While Echternach&rsquo;s research looked at what happens when someone who might be carrying the virus is wearing a shield, other researchers have tried to assess how they might protect the wearer from other people around them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne recent, but as yet unpublished, study by Israel Institute for Biological Research used water-sensitive paper stuck around the face of a mannequin wearing a plastic face shield.
 For larger droplets sprayed directly into the wearers face from 60cm (2ft) away by a cough or sneeze, it was as effective as a face mask.
 &ldquo;While medical masks have limited durability and little potential for reprocessing, face shields can be reused indefinitely and are easily cleaned with soap and water, or common household disinfectants.
 In most everyday situations, such as in a hair salon, the wearer might be moving around in close proximity to their customers as they cut hair.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the Israeli researchers moved the &ldquo;cough source&rdquo; just 30cm (1ft) above or below the mask &ndash; but still kept it 60cm away horizontally &ndash; the mannequin's face became spattered with droplets that spilled in around the sides of the visor.
 But with smaller cough aerosols less than 3.4 micrometres in size, the face shield blocked just 68%.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut there is another complication.
 As Echternach&rsquo;s tests with the singers showed, the fine mist that is released as we talk, sing or cough doesn&rsquo;t just disappear once it reaches a metre or so away.

 Covid-19 is no exception – and some experts say it could destroy whole nations and communities.
 Some people were forced into months of unbroken solitude, others trapped for weeks on end with an estranged spouse.
 Some saw it as a positive experience &ndash; a welcome opportunity to slow down, go for walks and relax with a loving partner, or enjoy quality time with the children.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhichever way the lockdown played out, there has been one near universal aspect to the past months &ndash; it abruptly disrupted our daily routines and living arrangements in ways that would not normally occur.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWill this strange time have left its mark on us, not just superficially, but deep down?
 As we venture out tentatively, do we do so with our personalities somehow altered?
 Research over the last few decades, however, has led to a consensus that, while personality traits are relatively stable, they are not completely fixed.
 Although conscious that I&rsquo;ve been more fortunate than many in my experience of the pandemic so far, I also know that I&rsquo;ve been feeling less stressed due to less rushing around, but also more withdrawn and introverted.
 Friends of mine (also not too adversely affected) agree they feel different &ndash; more reflective, perhaps, but also less sociable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely that these unprecedented times shaped people&rsquo;s personality traits to a certain degree as people were forced to leave their comfort zone and their daily routine,&rdquo; says Mirjam Stieger of the Lifespan Developmental Psychology Laboratory at Brandeis University, in Massachusetts, where she&rsquo;s been working on an app to help people deliberately change their traits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe many months of changes to our routines may have led to changes in our behaviour that will stick long after the pandemic has finished.
 This is partly due to the lack of longitudinal data, but also because people&rsquo;s experiences of lockdown were so different and would have interacted with their pre-pandemic traits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there will be an average effect &hellip; a trend that the majority of people will show,&rdquo; says Rodica Damian, from the Personality Development and Success Laboratory at the University of Houston\u003Cstrong\u003E.
 \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome preliminary data back this up.
 Angelina Sutin, a psychologist at Florida State University, led an as yet unpublished study that looked for signs of personality change during the very early stage of the pandemic in the US.
 By contrast, for people stuck indoors for months in an unhappy relationship or being harassed by their children, the effects on their personality are sure to be have been negative.
 &ldquo;For example, there is some evidence that being in an unhappy marriage (independent of lockdown) is associated with declines in spouses&rsquo; self-esteem and happiness,&rdquo; says Bleidorn.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople who score highly for neuroticism might have particularly struggled in this regard &ndash; this trait is associated with a tendency toward &ldquo;negative emotions like anxiety, vulnerability, sadness, and irritability,&rdquo; explains Rebecca Shiner, a clinical psychologist at Colgate University.
 &ldquo;People who struggle with high neuroticism also are prone to creating more stress for themselves, for example, by getting into conflict with other people or by avoiding situations that they find threatening.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about those people who were left completely isolated on their own during lockdown?
 If this forced solitary confinement provoked intense loneliness, we might predict, based on earlier research into loneliness and personality, an adverse effect on people&rsquo;s traits, in terms of increased neuroticism and an enforced reduction in extroversion.
 This is perhaps likely because modern technology now offers us so many ways to stay in touch with one another.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Most people seem to be pretty good at finding environments that fit their extraversion or can dial it up or down when asked to,&rdquo; says Bleidorn.
 &ldquo;Social media, communication technology and other technological developments have made it possible to socialise virtually.
 I imagine that extroverted people are more likely to take advantage of such opportunities.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt's also worth remembering that anyone with an outdoor space at home was still able to enjoy fresh air and sunlight during lockdown, as well as creature comforts like deliveries and streaming box sets.
 Such factors might help explain why the confinement of the past few months doesn&rsquo;t appear to have had some of the more adverse psychological effects observed in studies of people isolated in extreme environments.
 For now, the initial signs are that the isolation aspect of lockdown might not in itself have changed our personalities in a profound way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut of course the pandemic has involved much more than just the lockdown, and Damian suggests that some of the other consequences of Covid-19 might more be more relevant to personality change, such as people losing their jobs, falling ill or suffering bereavement.
 &ldquo;Job loss has been associated with decreased conscientiousness,&rdquo; she says.
 &ldquo;Illness has been associated with increased conscientiousness and neuroticism and lower extraversion.&rdquo; She cautions though that this remains merely informed speculation until more data is available.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we have been changed somehow by lockdown then as restrictions around the world are eased, a natural next question is whether and how we can change back again?
 Can we return to our old selves?
 People are adaptive &ndash; for instance, people&rsquo;s conscientiousness tends to increase when they take on a demanding role, and their traits rebound in positive fashion after leaving a difficult relationship, suggesting that we&rsquo;ll find a way to cope with whatever the future has in store.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShiner warns though that introverts like me might find it a particular challenge, at least at first.
 &ldquo;While in lockdown, introverts have been able to avoid the social pressure for interaction that is so common in places like the United States, and this may make re-entry difficult,&rdquo; she says.
 Her advice is to spend time with &ldquo;more familiar friends one-on-one or in very small groups &ndash; which is certainly more compatible with social distancing anyhow &ndash; as they navigate re-entry&rdquo;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDamian is upbeat about our collective ability to adjust as lockdown measures lift.
 &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think people need to worry about changing their traits back to pre-lockdown,&rdquo; she says.
 &ldquo;I expect the change will happen gradually and naturally for most people, once the environmental pressures change.
 It will just take time.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf anything, her advice is that we don&rsquo;t rush back to old ways.
 In Texas, where Damian is based, hospitals are at capacity following a surge in new infections after lockdown was lifted.
 &ldquo;I think that people have adjusted their pre-lockdown behaviours too quickly, so I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend the rest of the world follow suit right now,&rdquo; she says.

 In the coming weeks, I will learn what it is like to be a participant in one of the world&rsquo;s most promising efforts to tackle to the coronavirus pandemic.
 &ldquo;There is still much work to be done&hellip;but these early results hold promise,\" Sarah Gilbert of the University of Oxford said in a statement.
 The next step involves expanding the trial at a higher dose to thousands more people, volunteering at sites across the UK, as well as Brazil and South Africa.
 He&rsquo;d volunteered.
 One group will receive a vaccine that won&rsquo;t offer any protection against the coronavirus and the other half will get the test vaccine &ndash; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis vaccine is built upon a weakened version of a common cold virus that typically infects chimpanzees.
 It&rsquo;s a technique that the group had already been developing before the pandemic, to tackle Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) and Ebola.
 And it&rsquo;s why they were able to move so fast in response to Covid-19.
 In the early months of 2020, when the world was stumbling towards the grim realisation that this pandemic wasn&rsquo;t going away, the Oxford group was scrambling to refocus their work on the crisis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESnape explains what they did on the video I&rsquo;m watching.
 First, they took the chimp cold virus and genetically altered it so it is impossible to grow in humans (phew).
 Next they added genes that make proteins from the Covid-19 virus, called spike glycoprotein.
 If the body learns to recognise and develop an immune response to this spike glycoprotein, the hope is that it will help stop the Covid-19 virus from entering human cells.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHalf the volunteers will get this vaccine, Snape explains.
 The second group will be given an existing licensed vaccine called MenACWY (either Nimenrix or Menveo), which is used to protect against the causes of meningitis or sepsis.
 This vaccine is a &ldquo;control&rdquo; for comparison, and was chosen instead of an inert placebo so that the control group experience the effects (and side-effects) of a real vaccine, preventing them from working out which group they are in.
 Since 2015, MenACWY has been given routinely to teenagers in the UK, and also as a travel vaccine to high-risk parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa.
 One caught my attention: &ldquo;I agree that the samples collected will be considered a gift to Oxford University.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile knowing that some participants, in a different cohort of the same trial, would be asked to submit faecal samples.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI return home, feeling more informed, but also slightly more apprehensive than before.
 Like any clinical trial, it&rsquo;s necessary to ensure participants are fully aware of potential side-effects, from the mild (nausea, headaches and so on) to the rare and severe (Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes severe weakness and can be fatal).
 While I know that the risks are small, I can&rsquo;t deny it&rsquo;s somewhat daunting to hear them all in one go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the screening, volunteers even had to be briefed on &ldquo;theoretical concerns&rdquo; that the vaccine could make the effects of coronavirus worse.
 Some studies on animals that received experimental vaccines to protect against Sars (a related virus) have shown worsened lung inflammation when they were infected with Sars.
 One report had found similar lung inflammation in vaccinated mice infected with Mers.
 (And just to be absolutely clear, none of these potential reactions should bolster the unfounded claims of anti-vax campaigners).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVaccine day\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA week later, on 3 July, I am back in the windowless room at St George&rsquo;s where I had my screening appointment.

 I am intrigued to learn at this point that she is as in the dark as me about what will happen next.
 To ensure the trial results are fully robust, both the participants and the doctors injecting the vaccine do not know whether it is the experimental one or the control vaccine for meningitis\u002Fsepsis in the syringe.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile she is gone, I am left alone with my thoughts.
 They inevitably stray to the world outside.
 In England, where I live, it's the day before many of the lockdown rules are eased and many businesses can finally open again, from pubs to hairdressers.
 The social distancing guidance for England is also changing from two metres to one metre plus.
 These looming changes have prompted both excitement and nervous trepidation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy mind wanders to think of friends and family in other parts of the world, each experiencing the pandemic at different stages &ndash; some celebrating a virus-free country, others on an upwards curve towards a grim death-toll.
 For much of the previous year, I had lived in Massachusetts.
 On the day of my appointment, the news reports were grim for the people I knew back in the US &ndash; the country had experienced more than 40,000 daily cases on four separate days within a week, and the country was on a chilling trajectory.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI&rsquo;d also heard the latest numbers from Brazil on my drive over &ndash; a friend and his wife had recently returned there &ndash; that day, the country was nearing 1.5 million infections.
 Brazil&rsquo;s widespread outbreak is part of the reason the Oxford vaccine trial is now expanding to test volunteers in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and a site in northern Brazil.
 For the greater good, some of the 10,000 volunteers in my stage of the trial will need to encounter this killer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen Galiza returns she is holding a vial.

 And it&rsquo;s 50:50 about which one it is.

 You can&rsquo;t throw money at the problem and hope results happen faster.
 While the Oxford vaccine trial has already shown promising safety results, and the tantalising possibility of a protective immune response, it was only in 1,000 people.
 To roll out a vaccine to millions (or the whole world), you need a level of confidence that can only come with patience and more data.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPublic health officials will remember well the times that vaccine rollouts went wrong.
 In 1976, fears of a swine flu outbreak led the US government to accelerate vaccine development and inoculate tens of millions of Americans.
 &ldquo;The toughest job of anybody is the regulator, who has to make the call on whether it is safe and effective to roll out to the public.
 I would not want that job,&rdquo; he said.
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really hard call.
 In other words, they may not completely clear the virus, but instead mitigate its effects.
 People could still carry the virus even if they don&rsquo;t suffer symptoms, for example, spreading it to the unvaccinated.
 That protection would still be of huge value, but whatever happens, we need to be prepared for the long-haul.
 This virus might always be with us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs for me, knowing there&rsquo;s a 50:50 chance I received a dose of a promising vaccine provides a small comfort, but it certainly won&rsquo;t change my behaviour or my choices.
 Nor should it &ndash; the researchers were clear about that.
 Until I know for sure that we have a vaccine that works &ndash; protecting my wife, daughter, friends, family and strangers I pass on the street &ndash; I will continue to follow social distancing guidance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMainly, I&rsquo;m pleased to have the opportunity to play a very small part &ndash; along with 10,000 other people &ndash; in a trial that the whole world is watching.
 The pace at which the Oxford group has responded to this crisis, and the hard work and organisation of the people involved, is seriously impressive.
 Before the pandemic, many of these doctors and researchers were working in relatively obscure corners of vaccine development or paediatrics, pursuing their work through scientific curiosity or an individual sense of purpose.
 They never expected to carry the hopes and expectations of billions of people on their shoulders.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Oxford vaccine trial may not turn out to be the success that many wish for.
 It may not meet the safety and efficacy threshold that takes us out of these difficult times.
 But that&rsquo;s how science works &ndash; it&rsquo;s long-term, collective and filled with wrong turns &ndash; and right now I&rsquo;ve never been more glad that we have it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAs an award-winning science site, BBC Future is committed to bringing you evidence-based analysis and myth-busting stories around the new coronavirus.
 Richard Fisher describes what it’s like to be one of the volunteers in the clinical trials.
 Next it emerged that this might be the case for a significant number of people.
 If we are going to acquire long-term protection, it looks increasingly like it might have to come from somewhere else.
 \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut while the world has been preoccupied with antibodies, researchers have started to realise that there might be another form of immunity &ndash; one which, in some cases, has been lurking undetected in the body for years.
 An enigmatic type of white blood cell is gaining prominence.
 And though it hasn&rsquo;t previously featured heavily in the public consciousness, it may well prove to be crucial in our fight against Covid-19.
 It does this using proteins on its surface, which can bind to proteins on the surface of these imposters.
 Because T cells can hang around in the blood for years after an infection, they also contribute to the immune system&rsquo;s &ldquo;long-term memory&rdquo; and allow it to mount a faster and more effective response when it&rsquo;s exposed to an old foe.
 So far, so normal.
 But scientists have also recently discovered that some people can test negative for antibodies against Covid-19 and positive for T cells that can identify the virus.
 This suggests that some people already had a pre-existing degree of resistance against the virus before it ever infected a human.
 If scientists know which aspects of the immune system are the most important, they can direct their efforts to make vaccines and treatments that work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow immunity unfolds\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMost people probably haven&rsquo;t thought about T cells, or T lymphocytes as they are also known, since school, but to see just how crucial they are for immunity, we can look to late-stage Aids.
 The persistent fevers.
 The sores.
 The fatigue.
 The weight loss.
 The rare cancers.
 The normally harmless microbes, such as the fungus \u003Cem\u003ECandida albicans\u003C\u002Fem\u003E &ndash; usually found on the skin &ndash; which start to take over the body.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the course of months or years, HIV enacts a kind of T cell genocide, in which it hunts them down, gets inside them and systematically makes them commit suicide.
 &ldquo;It wipes out a large fraction of them,&rdquo; says Adrian Hayday, an immunology professor at King&rsquo;s College London and group leader at the Francis Crick Institute.
 &ldquo;And so that really emphasises how incredibly important these cells are &ndash; and that antibodies alone are not going to get you through.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring a normal immune response &ndash; to, let&rsquo;s say, a flu virus &ndash; the first line of defence is the innate immune system, which involves white blood cells and chemical signals that raise the alarm.
 This initiates the production of antibodies, which kick in a few weeks later.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;And in parallel with that, starting out about four or five days after infection, you begin to see T cells getting activated, and indications they are specifically recognising cells infected with the virus,&rdquo; says Hayday.
 These unlucky cells are then dispatched quickly and brutally &ndash; either directly by the T cells themselves, or by other parts of the immune system they recruit to do the unpleasant task for them &ndash; before the virus has a chance to turn them into factories that churn out more copies of itself.
 &ldquo;And almost certainly this is very good news for those who are interested in vaccines, because clearly we&rsquo;re capable of making antibodies and making T cells that see the virus.
 That&rsquo;s all good.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, one vaccine &ndash; developed by the University of Oxford &ndash; has already been shown to trigger the production of these cells, in addition to antibodies.
 It&rsquo;s still too early to know how protective the response will be, but one member of the research group told BBC News that the results were &ldquo;extremely promising&rdquo;.
 In many patients who are hospitalised with more serious Covid-19, the T cell response hasn&rsquo;t quite gone to plan.
 \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Vast numbers of T cells are being affected,&rdquo; says Hayday.
 &ldquo;And what is happening to them is a bit like a wedding party or a stag night gone wrong &ndash; I mean massive amounts of activity and proliferation, but the cells are also just disappearing from the blood.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne theory is that these T cells are just being redirected to where they&rsquo;re needed most, such as the lungs.
 But his team suspects that a lot of them are dying instead.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Autopsies of Covid-19 patients are beginning to reveal what we call necrosis, which is a sort of rotting,&rdquo; he says.
 This is particularly evident in the areas of the spleen and lymph glands where T cells normally live.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDisconcertingly, spleen necrosis is a hallmark of T cell disease, in which the immune cells themselves are attacked.
 &ldquo;If you look in post-mortems of Aids patients, you see these same problems,&rdquo; says Hayday.
 &ldquo;But HIV is a virus that directly infects T cells, it knocks on the door and it gets in.&rdquo; In contrast, there is currently no evidence that the Covid-19 virus is able to do this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;There are potentially many explanations for this, but to my knowledge, nobody has one yet,&rdquo; says Hayday.
 &ldquo;We have no idea what is happening.
 There&rsquo;s every evidence that the T cells can protect you, probably for many years.
 As they did so, their T cell responses became significantly weaker.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in the same experiment, the scientists also exposed mice to a flu virus.
 And in contrast to those infected with Covid-19, these mice managed to hold onto their T cells that acted against influenza well into their twilight years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an attractive observation, in the sense that it could explain why older individuals are more susceptible to Covid-19,&rdquo; says Hayday.
 &ldquo;When you reach your 30s, you begin to really shrink your thymus [a gland located behind your sternum and between your lungs, which plays an important role in the development of immune cells] and your daily production of T cells is massively diminished.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat does this mean for long-term immunity?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;With the original Sars virus [which emerged in 2002], people went back to patients and definitely found evidence for T cells some years after they these individuals were infected,&rdquo; says Hayday.
 &ldquo;This is again consistent with the idea that these individuals carried protective T cells, long after they had recovered.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that coronaviruses can lead to lasting T cells is what recently inspired scientists to check old blood samples taken from people between 2015 and 2018, to see if they would contain any that can recognise Covid-19.
 The fact that this was indeed the case has led to suggestions that their immune systems learnt to recognise it after being encountering cold viruses with the similar surface proteins in the past.
 \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis raises the tantalising possibility that the reason some people experience more severe infections is that they haven&rsquo;t got these hoards of T cells which can already recognise the virus.
 &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that the jury is still out,&rdquo; says Hayday.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, no one has ever verified if people make T cells against any of the coronaviruses that give rise to the common cold.
 &ldquo;To get funding to study this would have required a pretty Herculean effort,&rdquo; says Hayday.
 Some might trigger the production of antibodies &ndash; free-floating proteins which can bind to invading pathogens, and either neutralise them or tag them for another part of the immune system to deal with.
 Others might aim to get T cells involved, or perhaps provoke a response from other parts of the immune system.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;There really is an enormous spectrum of vaccine design,&rdquo; says Hayday.
 He&rsquo;s particularly encouraged by the fact that the virus is evidently highly visible to the immune system, even in those who are severely affected.
