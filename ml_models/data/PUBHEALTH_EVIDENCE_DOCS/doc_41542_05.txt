About this guidance
 
This guidance tells you about 
the operation of the
 
Dublin Regulation
 
when 
determining the State responsible 
for examining an asylum cla
im a
nd 
then 
either 
transferring an as
ylum 
claimant 
from the UK 
to another European State
 
(for the 
purpose of the guidance
,
 
referred 
hereafter 
as a
 
Dublin State
 
or 
Dublin States
)
 
or 
accepting that the claimant should have his or h
er claim examined in the UK
.
 
 
 
The instruction provides 
you with
 
guidance on the 
Dublin III 

referral, consideration 
of responsibility 
and 
the 
transfer process to 
the
 
responsible 
State
. It 
also tells you about our policy when 
making a

responsibility f
or
 
an asylum 
claimant 
who is in that State under the terms of the

Purpose of 
instruction
 
This guidance explains how 
you
 
identify 
and process 
potential 
c
laims
 
for transfer out 
of the UK to ano
ther State
 
to which t
he Dublin III Regulation applies. 
 
 
It
 
also explains the processes involved when 
a request is made by a
nother State for 
the UK to accept responsibility for 
consider
ing
 
an asylum 
claim 
under
 
the Dublin 
III 
Regulation.
 
 
Background
 
The
 
Dublin Regulation (E
U) No.604/2013
 
(

Dubli
n III

) 
is 
EU legislation
 
that 
establishes the criteria and mechanisms for 
determin
ing 
which 
single 
State is 
responsible for examin
ing an 
application for international protection (
an 
asylum 
claim
)
. It 
aims 
to prevent
 
both
 

asylum sho
pping

,
 
where an indivi
dual moves 
between States to seek the most attractive regime of protection, and
 
the 
phenomenon of
 

refugees in orbit

 
where no sing
le State permits access to an 
asylum procedure.
 
I
t reflects the principle that those seeking internati
onal protection 
should 
seek asylum in the first safe country they reach.
 
 
Lodging an asylum claim at the earliest opportunity 
upon arrival i
n the territor
y of the 
Dublin States 
enables an individual to provide information to the asylum authorities 
in that 
first 
State on family t
ies to other 
Dublin 
State(s)
.
 
T
his information may be 
relevant to the determination of responsibility for examining t
he asylum clai
m.
 
 
In order to identify a single State that is responsible for examining the asylum 
claim
,
 
the 
Dublin
 
III 
Regulation uses 
a 
number of specific criteria 
listed 
in descending order 
of importance
 
to identify the 
responsible
 
State, enabling the 
transfer of an
 
asylum 
applicant 
once responsibility has been
 
accepted
.
 
W
here no responsible Dublin State 
ca
n be designated on the basis of 
the criteria in the 
Dublin III 
Regulation the first 
State in which the asylum 
claim
 
is lodged shall be responsible.
 
 
The 
Dublin III
 
Regulation 
is consistent with the
 
principle of family uni
ty in accordance 
with the European 
Convention for the Protection of
 
Human Rights, the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights and the best interests of the child. 
T
he
 
provisions
 
on 
family 
unity 
and the best i
nterests of the child
 
are primary considerations
 
which may
 
result 
i
n the State 
responsible fo
r examining the asylum claim 
bei
ng 
the State
 
where an 
asylum 

family members 
or relatives
, as defined in the 
Dublin III 
Regulation, 
are legally present
 
o
r resident 
(
depending on the circumstances of the 
case
)
.
 
T
he determination of responsibility 
for examining an asylum claim ba
sed on 
family links does not anticipate the outcome of the examination of the claim, only that 
the merits of that claim will be exa
mined by the responsible Dublin State.
 
 
The
 
criteria determining responsibility 
also
 
reflect 
the basic principle 
that the Sta
te
 
which played the greatest part
 
in

Dublin III 
Regulation applies should 
normall
y 
be responsible for examining his or her 
a
sylum 
claim
.
 
 
The 
Dublin III 
Regulation gives
 
Dubl
in States
 
discretion to derogate
 
from the 
responsibility criteria

,
 
which permit a 
Dublin State
 
to examine a
n asylum
 
claim 
lodged with it
,
 
or 
when asked to do 
so by 
another 
Dublin State
,
 
even if such examinati
on is not its responsibility und
er the 
Regulation

 
responsibility criteria.
 
A Dublin State may ask another 
Dublin State to 
accept responsibility for an asylum cla
im 
to bring together family relations 
on 
hu
manitarian grounds 
based 
in
 
particular 
on 
family o
r cultural considerations
 
in 
cas
es where the strict application of the Regulation would keep them apart.
 
 
The Dublin III Regulation provides in Article 3(2) that w
here it is impossible to 
transfer an applicant (claimant) to the State primarily designated a
s responsible for 
determining th
e claim for asylum because there are substantial grounds for believing 
tha
t there are systemic flaws in the asylum procedure and in
 
the reception conditions 
for applicants in that State, resulting in a risk of inhuman or deg
rading treatment, the 
determinin
g State shall continue to examine the criteria in order to establish wheth
er 
another State can be designated as responsible. If no 
other State is responsible the 
Dublin State which is carrying out the determination process (

shall b
ecome the responsible State.

the binding 
criteria laid down in the 
Dublin III 
Regulation
 

 
ensuring that the fundamental human rights of those who are subject to the

Application in respect of children
 
Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration 
Act 2009
 
requires
 
the 
Secret
ary of State 
to
 
make arrangement
s 
for ensuring that immigration, 
asylum and 
nationality functions are di
scharged having regard to the need to safeguard and 
promote
 
the welfare of children who are in the UK
.
 
 
Although 
s
ection 55 
does not apply to children o
utside the UK
 
the statutory 
guidan
ce, 
Every 
C
hild Matters: Change 
for 
C
hildren
,
 
clarifies the approach to be 
taken by requiring staff to take into account the
 
spirit of the duty and to abide b
y any 
international or local agreements that are in 
place. 
The application of the spirit of the 
duty means that when a
 
claim or r
equest 
has been received that requires a response 
you must be alert to any indications that t
he child may be in need of assista
nce, 
s
upport or protection from harm that 
may be 
best provided by the authorities in the 
country where the child is present. If t
his is the case and wherever possible the 
normal providers of relevant services to children i
n that country should be informed 
where 
there are safeguarding or welfare needs that require attention.
 
 
The requirement to abide by any international or local agr
eements in place means 
just that. When considering a 

take charge

 
request under 
the 
Dublin I
II 
Regulation
,
 
the presumption mus
t be t
hat those making the request are doing so having taken 
into account the safety and welfare needs, and well
-
being in the for
m of best 
interests of the child who is the subject of the request. However, acting in a way 
that 
takes account of these intere
sts is
 
a shared responsibility at this point and you 
must 
carefully consider all of the information and evidence provided as to h
ow a child will 
be affected by a decision and this must be addressed when assessing whether a
n 
applicant meets the 
criteria
 
in 
the 
Du
blin III 
Regulation
.
 
In addition, you
 
must 
demonstrate that all relevant information and evidence provided about the best 
i
nterests of a child
, such as a sibling or other relative,
 
in the UK have been 
considered. 
Thi
s is required as a particular obli
gation
 
under section 55 as well as by 
the more general provisions of 
the 
Dublin III
 
Regulation
. You
 
must carefully assess 
the qua
lity of any evidence provided. Original documentary 
evidence
 
from official or 
independent sou
rces must 
be 
given more 
weight 
in 
the decision
-
making process

The Dublin III
 
Regulation
 
The
 
Dublin Regulation (EU) No.604/2013
 
is an EU Regulation that determines the 
S
tate responsible for deciding an asylum claim lodged i
n an EU Member State, 
Iceland, Norway, Switzerland or Liechtenstein
.
 
 
The cur
rent Dublin
 
III
 
Regulation was a
dopted in June 2013 as 
Regulation (EU) 
No.604/2013
 
and is 
known as the Dublin III Regulation 
or 

Dublin III

. This reflects 
that it is the third ve
rsion of the rules to determine a single responsible State that has 
been agre
ed and implemented 
by European S
tates 
since 1990 (when the 
original 
instrument known as the 
Dublin Convention was agreed).
 
Ad
ditional rules on the 
practical implementation of the Dublin 
III 
Regulation 
are set out in
 
Commission 
Implementing Regulation (EC) No 1560/2003
, as amended by 
Commission 
Implementing Regulation (EU) No.
 
118/2014
.
 
Subject to transitio
nal provisions
,
 
the 
Dublin III Regulation has applied to 
asylum 
claims
 
and requests 
made 
be
tw
een 
Dublin States
 
from 1 January 2014.
 
 
If
 
you
 
encounter
 
a 
legacy case
 
where responsibility was determined and transfer to 
another 
State agreed with reference to t
he terms of the 
earlier 
Dublin II Regulation
,
 
for example
 
the individual
 
absconded before tra
nsfer or transfer was prevented by a 
suspensive legal challenge, the case should be continued under the terms of Dublin 
II. 
You 
mus
t establish the case history, in
 
particular any information on the 
whereabouts of the 
applicant and
 
their
 
personal circumstan
ces
,
 
and then seek 
immediate advice from senior caseworkers in 
the 
Third Country Unit 
(TCU) within UK 
Immigration Enforcement (IE).

The United Nations

The

Children shall have the right to such prote

being. They may express their views freely. Su
ch views shall be taken into 
consideration 
on matters which concern th
em in accordance with their age and 
maturity. In all actions relating to children, whether tak

private institutions, the child's best interests must be a prima
ry consideration. 
Every child shall have th

European Convention on Human Rights
 
Not all 
Dubli
n State
 
human rights obligations are explici
tly covered by the 
respons
ibility criteria set out in the Dublin 
III 
Regulation,
 
but these
 
broader human 
rights obligati
ons must still be taken into account 
when
 
applying the 
Dublin III 
Regulation
. The
 
European Con
vention on Human Rights
 
(ECHR) provides the 
framework for ensuring the rights and fundamental
 
freedoms of individuals in 
European signatory states
.
 
 
Domestic legislation
 
T
CU within 
IE 
considers 
whether or not to certify asylum 
cl
aims
 
with reference to 
Schedule 3 to the Asylum a
nd Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004
.
 
 
The provisions in Schedule 3 to th
e 2004 Act deal with situations where a perso
n 
can be removed to a saf
e third country without substantive consideration of his or 
her asylum claim in the UK. 
These 
provisions are also applied by TCU in cases that 
are 
not
 
in the scope of the Dublin 
III 
Regu

,
 
for example
,
 
with the 
aim
 
of preventing secondary 

 
if the person in the UK 
who has claimed asylum has already been 
recognised to be a beneficiary of 
protection
. In such cases
 
TCU will look to see if removal 
to the State that granted 
protection is viabl
e in line with paragraph 
345A(i) of the Immigration Rules
 
(
Immigration Rules part 11: asylum
)
.
 
 
In considering wheth
er an asylum 
claimant 
can be removed to a thi
rd country, 
obligations u
nder the Refugee Convention and the Human Rights Act 
1998 
are 
relevant.
 
 
A safe third country 
is one of which the person is not a national or citizen and is
:

his race, 
religion, nati
onality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion
 

 
a place from which a pe
rson will not be sent to another country otherwise than 
in accord
ance with the Refugee Convention
 

 
a place from which a person will not be
 
sent
 
to another State in
 
contravention of 
his ECHR rights
 
 
If the above conditions are met
,
 
then a 

safe third country

 
decision is made
. T
his is 
referred to as the 

safe third country

 
or 

asylum

 
certification.
 
 
An applicant may challenge his or her rem
oval on the basis that it
 
would be unlawful 
under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 
1998 
as being incompatible with his
 
rights 
protected by 
the ECHR.
 
 
There is a graduated approach taken towards the consideration of human rights 
claims 
against removal 
with
in Schedule 3 to the 2004
 
Act. For Dublin 
III Regulation 
cases the provisions in either Part 2 or Part 5 of Schedule 3 
are relevant.
 
 
If rem
oval is to one of the States listed at Part 2
,
 
those States are considered to be 
ones that would not remove a
 
person
 
in contravention of 
the 
Refugee Convention or 
the European Convention on Human Rights
 
and where a person would not be 
at risk 
of persecutio
n
. Where Part 
2 
applies any other human rights challenge to removal 
will be certified 
as 

clearly unfounded

 
unless 
the Secretary of State 
fo
r the Home 
Department 
is satisfied that the claim is not 
(
clearly unfounded
)
. Such challenges 
could, for example, b
e based on Article 3 
ECHR (
the 
person 
claims that reception 
conditions in the country concerned are such that 
he or 
she 
would face inhuman or
 
degrading treatment there
) 
or on Article 8 grounds 
(
that removal from the UK would
 
unlawfully
 
interfere with his o
r her private or family life
 
in the UK)
. This certificate is 
referred to as the 

human rights

 
or 

clearly unfounded

 
certificate.
 
 
If a Dubl
in removal is to a 
Dublin 
State not listed at Part 2 (
Croatia or Liechtenstein
)
 
the provisions
 
in Part 5 are relevant
. Part 5 
provides for case
-
by
-
case consideration 
of both Refugee Convention and 
human rights 
challenges to removal
 
to see whether 
they coul
d be certified for a particular individual. 
Cases where either Croatia or 
Liech
tenstein is the
 
responsible Dublin State must be discussed with a senior 
caseworker
 
in TCU.
 
 
Paragraph 
345E
 
of the Immigration Rules provides that t
he S
ecretary of State
 
for the
 
Home Department
 
shall decline to substantively consider an asylum claim if the
 
applicant is t
ransferable to another country in accordance with the Dublin
 
III
 
Regulation
 
(

)
.

Criteria
 
and mechanisms
 
for determining 
respo
nsibility
 
The Dublin process includes transfers into and out of the UK
. O
ther
 
Dublin States
 
can 
request the UK 
take
s
 
responsibility 
for 
asylum 
claimants
 
i
n the same way as we 
can make requests to them with reference to the Dublin III 
Regulation
. 
In terms 
of 
formal requests to acknowledge
 
(accept) 
responsibility there are 
2 
types of request:
 
 

 

tak
e charge

the premise that a 
first applicat
ion
 
(claim)
 
has 
been lodged
,
 
so
 
the responsible 
Dublin State
 
is to be determined
 
in accordance 
with t
he criteria 
in the Dublin 
III 
Regulation
.
 

 

take back

requests involve cases where the applic
ant has lodged an 
application 
(claim) 
in one 
Dublin State
 
and has moved on to another 
Dublin 
State
 
where he or she has lodged a further applic
ation or is present i
llegally, 
without making a further application
.
 
T
he 
no
tion of 

take back

implies that a
n 
app
licant has previously been known as an asylum applicant in another 
Dublin 
State
 
and so his or her application can be 

taken back

 
into the asy
lum system 
there
.
 
 
Th
e general principles and the criteria for determining 
responsibility are set out 
below
:
 
 
Arti
cle 3 
of the Regulation 
sets out that where no 
Dublin State
 
can be designated on 
the basis of the criteria listed in th
e
 
Dublin III 
Regulation
, the first 
Dublin St
ate
 
in 
which the 
claim 
for international protection wa
s lodged shall be responsible for 
exami
ning it.
 
 
Article 6
 
provide
s
 
guarantees for 
minors (
child
ren
)
 
that the best interests of the 
child should be a primary consideration in all st
ages of the procedure
 
to determine 
the 
Dublin State
 
responsib
le
 
for examining a
 
claim 
for international protection
.
 
The 
Dublin States
 
shall as soon as possible take appropriat
e steps to identify family 
members and may call for the assistance of internation
al or other relevant 
organisations and
 
may facilitate the 
child

organisations
.
 
 
Chapter III of the Regulation
 
Articles 7 to 15 set out th
e criteria for determining the Dublin State responsible for 
examining the asylum c
laim. Article 7 intr
oduces the Chapter
,
 
the criteria should be 
considered in hierarchical order from Article 8 to
 
15.
 
 
Article 7
 

 
Hierarchy of criteria
 
The criteria for dete
rmining the 
Dublin State
 
responsible shall be applied in the order 
in which the ar
ticles are set out i
n Chapter III of the 
Dublin III 
Regulation. 
T
he 
Dublin 
State
 
responsible shall be determined 
on the basis of the situation obtaining when 
the applicant first lodged his or her 
claim 
for international
 
protection with a 
Dublin 
State
.

), 
a 
person holding a valid visa,

across an exter

,
 
provided
 
the 
asylum claim
 
is made within 12 months of the date of that illegal 
entry. 
 
 
In circumstan
ces where 
Dublin
 
S
tates have tolerated mass crossings of their 
borders, such as was seen during the migration crisis in 2015, the individuals 
c
ondu
cting the crossi
ngs are not considered to have been issued a visa or to have 
entered lawfully. 
 
 
In Jafari C
-
646/16 the court found that 
the lodging of an appeal against a transfer 
decision has no effect on the running of the period of 12 months follow
ing 
the 
irregular bo
rder crossing (Article 13(1) DRIII), but that the period of 6 months to carry 
out the transfe
r does not start to run until a final decision on an appeal with 
suspensive effect has been reached, including when the national court requests
 
a 
p
reliminary rulin
g from the CJEU.
 
 
Article 13(2) sets out that w
here a State cannot or can no l
onger be held r
esponsible 
on the
 
basis
 
of Article 13(1),
 
the responsible State is that where 
the individual has 
entered the territories of the Dublin States i
rregularly (or the c
ircumstances of entry 
cannot be established) and 
it can be shown that the applicant has been 
living 
in the 
State 
for at least 5 
consecutive 
months (

tolerated illegal pres
ence

)
.
 
If the applicant 
has been living for periods of time in s
everal Member States
, each of at least 
5
 
months, the Member State where the applicant has been living most re

be responsible.
 
Where the applicant has been living for a cumulat

months across several Member States the criteria in A

All cases without EURODAC

reviewed and considered by 
TCU caseworkers in order to assess whether or not it is appropriate to make a take 
charge request based 
on Article 13.2 (or on any other basis in the Dublin 
Regulation
, 
as provided for in the Dublin III guidan
ce in general). 
 
 
A
n initial assessment needs to be made on the suitability of a case for transfer, 
based on the age of the applicant, medical conditio
ns, family links and a broader 
assessment of vulnerability.
 
 
 
 

ty is based on a t
h
ree
-
stage process:
 
 
1.
 
Is there evidence of the individual circumventing immigration control whilst in 
one (or more) Dublin States, and
 
showing wilful disregard for the asylum 
procedures available in those States?
 
A lack of a EURODAC hit pr
ovides some 
prima 
f
acie evidence of this but needs to be considered alongside the broader 
immigration history of the applicant, the account of his or h
er travel route and 
any mention 
of having been fingerprinted en
-
route. An assessment must be 
made on whet
her it is reasonab
l
e to consider that the failure to engage with the 
asylum system of another 
Dublin
 
State, when presented with the opportunity to 
do, 

 
 
This may differ from case to case and 
will depend on other informat
ion available in t
h
e round.
 
 
2.
 
Is there a clear lack of detail or knowledge about their journey to the UK, and 
the time it took?
 
Caseworkers should have 
regard to the particulars of each

individual case and the account given but are asked to make an assessme
nt of 
the plausibi
l
ity of the information presented.
 
 
Has the applicant presented a 
reasonable amount of detail regarding their immigration history, an
d how they 
entered the UK?  
 
 
3.
 
Are there large gaps/incoherency in the
 

 
Immigration History?
 
Ca
seworkers should as
sess the credibility and coherency of the immigration
 
history and travel route.
 
 
Where there are clear gaps or time
-
lags that are 
un
accounted for
,
 
caseworkers should consider whether the information 
presented is credible in the light o
f 
other information a
vailable.
 
 
Caseworkers should make an overall assessment of the credibility of the information 
before them in an individual case and
 
look to make a TCR citing Article 13.2 only 
where they feel they are satisfied
 
on the balance of proba
bi
lities 
that the ind
ividual 
has spent at least 5 months in a
 
single
 
Dublin
 
state.   
 
 
 
 
Example wording
 
Below is some suggested wording that caseworker
s can use when drafting TCRs.  
Caseworkers should ensure that when used, these are fully tailored to ad
dre
ss the 
facts of th
e individual cases:
 
 

 
Regarding his
/her
 
claims about his
/her
 
whereabouts prior to arriving in the 
UK, it is notable that [
to be expan
ded as relevant
 
e.g. the applicant claims 
not to know which country he
/she
 
was in at any given time; he
/sh
e
 
is specific 
abou
t some aspects of his
/her
 
journey e.g. to Turkey, but vague thereafter].
 
 
 
The account of his
/her
 
journey in terms of duration and l
ocation(s) [

relevant
 

credibility.
 
 
 
 

 
The applicant was
 
apprehended in connection with entering the UK illegally 

cland
estine departur
e from
 
[Insert country]
.
 
 
 
 

 
There is no evidence that the applicant sought asylum elsewhere
 
in the EU or 
the 
Associated States participating in the Dublin Regulation demonstrating a 
complete disregard for the immigration controls of other co
untries, in add
ition 

 
 

 
Taking t
he above elements 

of his
/her
 
travel history cannot, on balance, be relied upon as credible in 
term
s of its durati
on or locations. On that basis, noting his
/her
 
arrival from 
[Insert country] 
and in the abs
ence of any eviden
ce to the contrary, we 
consider it likely that the applicant has been in the 
Dublin
 
S
tate for at least 5 
months.  Given that [he
/she
] arrived from 
[Insert country]
, we request that 
[Insert country] 
accept responsibility for examining his
/
her
 
asylum claim w
ith 
reference to Article 13.2.

Dependent persons
 
W

and the parties 
give their 
con
sent in writing
. Not

so that it is a

illness or a

Article 17
 

 
Discretionary clauses
 
 
Article 17(1)
 
is known as the 

sovereignty clause

. It 
permits a 
Dublin S
tat
e
 
to decide 
to examine a
 
claim 
for international protection lodged with it even if it is not 
responsible fo
r any other reaso
n laid down in t
he 
Dublin III 
Regulation
.
 
In other 
words
,
 
this provision concerns 
a situation where
, for example,
 
a
 
claimant 
is in t
he UK 
and 
has lodged a claim here and, 
although another Dublin State is responsible for 
examining the 
claim
,
 
there are excep
tional compassionate circumstances
, such as 
individual human rights considerations
, that justify the exercise of di
scretion to 
exami
ne the 
asylum claim 
in the UK.
 
 
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has provided guidance on 
this 
provision in
 
the case 
C
-
578/16 PPU CK and others
.
 
The Court considered that a
 
transfer in itself ca
n entail a real r
isk of inhuman or degrading treatment 
(
within the 
meaning of Article 4 Charter
 
of Fundamental Rights of the Europea
n Union
), notably
 
in circumstances where the transfer of an asylum 
claimant 
with a particularly serious 
mental or physical c
ondition
 
leads to
 

Therefore,
 
t
he authorities of a 
transferring 
State must take i
nto account objec
tive 
factors, such as medical certificates, which are capable of demonstrating the 
particular seriousness o
f a person's illn
ess and the significant and irre
versible 
 Page

of 
52
 
 
Published for Home Office staff on 
14 August 2020
 
 
 
consequences that a transfer may 
result 
for that person. 
The transferring 
authorities 
must 
eliminate any serious doubt as to the impact of the transfer on the health of the 
person concerned by ensur
ing that the asyl
um 
claimant 
is accompanied during the 
actual transfer by the appropriate medical staff who have the necessary equip
ment, 
resources a
nd
/or 
medicines, to prevent any aggravation of his 
or her condition 
or any 
act of violence towards himself 
or 
others
. 
The tr
ansferring and receiving Dublin 
States must also ensure that the asylum 
claimant 
receives care upon arrival in 
the 
responsible State
.
 
 
The Court added that, if necessary, the transferring State 
should 
delay 
the transfer 
for as long as the 

health
 
condition does not 
allow 
such a transfer. The 
requesting State may choose to examine the request itself by 
making use of the 
provis
ion in 
Article 17(1) 
of the 
Dublin III
 
Regulation
, but t
hat provision cannot
 
be 
interpreted to 
mean that th
ere is 
an obligat
ion for th
e
 
State to 
exerc
ise discretion. I
f 
the state of health of the 
claimant 
does not
, however, 
allow the State to 
make the 
tran
sfer within 
the permitted 
six
-
month
 
period, the 
normal rules in Article 29 of the 
Dublin III 
Regulation app
ly and the 
respon
sible 
State is 
relieved of
 
its obligations 
to 
examine the claim 
and 
so 
responsibility 
is 
transferred to the requesting State
.
 
 
Artic
le 17(2)
 
also 
concerns the exercise of discretion, 
but in different circumstances.  
It 
mak
es 
specific refer
e
nce to the situa
tion where 
either 
a 
Dublin State
 
carrying out 
the procedure to determine 
responsibility
 
or the responsible 
Dublin State
 
itself may
,
 
at any time before a first decision on the substance of the protection claim is made
,
 
request another 
Dubli
n
 
State 
to 
bring 
together any family relations on humanitarian 
grounds
 
based in particular on family or cultural considerations
. For this reason this
 
provision is sometimes known as the 

humanitarian clause

 
(compared to the 

sovereignty clause

, above)
.
 
 
A
rticle 17(2) sta
tes: 
 
 

The requested Member State shall carry out any necessary checks to examine 
the humanitarian grounds cited,
 
and shall reply t
o the requesting Member State 
within two months of receipt of the request 

c
o
mmunication netw
ork set up under Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1560/2003. 
A reply refusing the request shall state the reasons on which the refus
al is based. 
 
 
Where the requested Member State accepts the request, responsibility for 
examining the 
appli
cation shall be t
ransferred to it.
 
 
Unlike TCRs lodged under other articles, requests made under Article 17
(2)
 
are not 
subject to the default accep
tance provisions of Article 22 (7). This is due to the 
discretionary nature of the article which expre
ssly re
cognises that the
 
state to whom 
the request has been made is not otherwise responsible. 
 
 
Unlike the terms
 

family member

 
and 

relative

, the term
 

relations

 
is not defined
 
in 
the Dublin III Regulation
. 
T
he reference to family and cultural conside
rations
 
in 
Article 17(2)
 
allows 
Dublin States
 
to exercise their discretion to bring together 
individuals who are part of an extended family group recognis
ed in other cultures. 
The persons 
concerned 
must consent in writing.

In all Article 17 cases 

 
either
 
the so
vereignty clause 
in 17(1) or the humanitarian 
clause in 17(2) 
-
 
the evidence submitted with the request to exercise discretion must 
be coherent, ve

exercise discretion 
to examine t
he clai
m(s) in the UK wh

responsible 
will be rare
 
and on an exceptional basis
.

stay in more

Dublin States
 
are required to use any information available to them (this may 
in

family relations and establ

In order to successfully ide

at the earliest 
opportunity

the 
child
 
should be made aware
 
of this provisi

provide as much detail as possible of the whereabouts of any family members known 
to him or her so that effor

child
 
with them may be 
undertaken quickly. 
Dublin S

should have in 
place mechanisms
 
and standard 
procedures for the enquiries and information exchange that may be required in order 
to identify the unaccompanied 
ch
ild

s
 
family ties, because these will need to be 
completed as quickly as possible. 
Whilst
 
it is acknowledged t
hat 
the requirem
ent on 
Dublin States
 
is to make efforts to identify the family member in question
,
 
it will not 
always be possible to find them (Ar

Dublin process: requests to 
transfer 
out of the UK to another Dublin State
 
This pa
ge tells you a
bout requests to transfer out of the UK to another Dublin state.
 
 
The Dublin Regulation 
lays down a hierarchy of
 
responsibility cr
iteria
 
(
Article
 
7
).
 
The 
Dublin State
 
where the 
claim for asylum 
is first lodged sends a request to the
 
Dublin St
ate
 
it deems r
esponsible according to the criteria (unless it 
establishes 
that 
it is itself responsible: 
Article
 
3(2)
). Upon acceptance, 
whether
 
that is given actively 
by the reque
sted State or is by default (see below), 
the requested State becomes 
respons
ible for exami
ning th
at claim
.
 
 
When 
an asylum 
claim 
has been lodged 
in the UK 
and
 
there is evidence 
to
 
suggest 
that another
 
Dublin State
 
may be
 
responsible for examining 
it 
under
 
the Dublin 
III 
Regulation
,
 
t
he National Asylum
 
Allocation
 
Unit (NAAU) 
will r
efer the case 
to the 
Third
-
country Unit (TCU)
. TCU will
 
consider
 
the application of the Dublin 
III 
Regulation
. TCU considers w
hether or n
ot 
the 
Secretary of State

Department

Case
 
law on the 
suspension 
of transfers
 
Greece
: 
Dublin removals to 
Greece
 
were 
suspended by all Dublin States since 2011 
a
s a result of rul
ings from the
 
European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in the case
 
M
SS vs Belgiu
m and Greece
 
and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) 
in 
NS and others C
-
411/10
.
 
 
In December 2016 the European Commiss
ion issued a 
non
-
binding
 
Recommendation to the Member States concerning a process towards the gradual 
resumption of the Dublin trans
fers to Gre
ece. The resumption of transfers should not 
be applied retroactively and would only concern asylum applicants who
 
entered 
Gree
ce irregularly from 15 March 2017 onwards or for whom Greece is responsible 
from 15 March 2017 under other Dublin crite
ria
, for ex
ample where Greece had 
issued a visa after that date
.
 
 
The Recommendation included the conditions that applicants
 
should only 
be 
transferred if the Greek authorities give individual assurances in each case that the 
asylum applicant will be hosted in approp
riate reception centres in Greece and 
treated in accord
ance with the standards set out in EU 
asylum 
law. The Comm
ission 
also i
ndicated that
,
 
for the time being, the transfer of vulnerable migrants (especially 
unaccompanied 
child
ren
) back to Greece is not r
ecommended. Notwithstanding this 
r
e
commendation
,
 
transf
ers from the
 
UK to Greece remain suspended
 
pending 
clarifi
cation of the
 
position regarding th
e
 
nature of individual assurances and any 
developing case
 
law in the event that other Dublin States graduall
y resume transfers
.

The situation remains under review
. Any case where Greece appears to be the 
responsible Dubl
in State or w
here there is evidence that an applicant for asylum in 
the UK has already been recognised as a beneficiary of international protec
tion in 
Greece must be discussed with a senior casework
er, who may then wish to seek 
further advice from Asylum P
olicy
 
on the 
latest position
.
 
 
Hungary
: 
in
 
August 2016 in the case of 
I
brahimi and Abasi vs The Secretary of 
State for the Ho
me Department
,
 
the High Court held that Dublin III 
Regulat
ion 
transfers
 
from the UK to 
Hungary
 
were unlawful. At the date of the judgment the 
Court found that having considered the available evidence r
egarding the asylum 
system in Hungary
,
 
the applicants w
ould be at risk of refoulement from Hungary to 
Serbia (and
 
beyond). The
 
judgment noted that the relevant evidence may change 
the assessment of risk in the future: Dublin transfers from the UK to Hungar
y remain 
suspended, 
with 
the situation remain
ing 
under 
review. Any case where Hungary 
appears t
o
 
be the responsib
le Dublin Sta
te or where there is evidence that an 
applicant for asylum in the UK has been recognised as a beneficiary of international 
protect
ion in Hungary must be discussed with a senior casework
er, who may then 
wish to seek further advice from Asylum P
olicy.
 
 
Gener
al Principles: 
In
 
Jawo C
-
163/17 
t
he CJEU ruled that, according to its
 
case 
law
, an asylum applicant may no
t be transfer
red under the Dublin III Regulation to 
the 
Dublin
 
State responsible for 
processing their application, if the living conditions 
wou
ld expose them to a situation of extreme material poverty amounting to inhuman 
or degrading treatment within the 
meaning of Ar
ticle 4 CFR. In this regard, the Court 
held that the threshold was only 
met where such deficiencies, in light of all the 
circumsta
nces of the individual case, attained a particularly high level of severity 
beyond a high degree of insecurity or
 
a significan
t degradation of living conditions. 
The latter finding is also supported
 
by the
 
jurisprudence
 
of the European Court of 
Human R
ights. Corres
pondingly, national courts had the obligation to examine, on 
the basis o
f information that is objective, reliable, specific and pr
operly updated and 
having regard to the standard of protection of fundamental rights guaranteed by EU 
law, whethe
r there was a
 
real risk for the applicant to find himself in such situation of 
extrem
e material poverty.
 
 
With regard to the extension of the t
ime limit for transfer, the Court noted,
 
inter alia
, 

e reach of th
e national 
authorities responsible for carrying out the transfer. This m
ay be presumed when the 
applicant has left the accommodati
on allocated to them without informing the 
competent authorities, provided that they have been informed of this o
bligation. 
Ho
wever, under such circumstances the applicant retains the possibility to
 
demonstrate that there were valid reasons for not informi
ng the authorities of his 
absence and that he did not have the intention to evade the reach of those 
authorities.

timely and adequate information 
on the
 
Dublin

If a potential Dublin case is identified, you must

3

Although the burden of proof is on the responsible

it is i

Regulation) is legally 
present, provided this is 
in 
the best interest

Detention
 
UK law provides broad powers to detain in an immigration co

I
mmigration 
detention is only lawful where it is based on one of the statutory powers to detain 
and where it acco
rds w
i
th the limitations set out by domestic and ECHR case
 
law 
and with stated detention policy.
 
 
Recital 20 of the Dublin 
III 
Regulatio
n refers to the underlying principle that a person 
should not be held in detention for the sole reason that he or she is
 
seek
i
ng 
international protection. 
Article
 
28
 
of
 
the
 
Dublin
 
III
 
R
egulation
 
also provides 
that 
Dublin States
 
shall not hold a person in 
detent
ion for the sole reason that he or she 
is subject to the procedure established in the 
Dublin III 
Regulation

Dublin States
 
may
, however,
 
detain the person 
concerned in order t
o secure transfer procedures
 
in ac
cordance with this Regulation, 
on the basis of an individual assessment and only in so far as detention is 
proportional and other 
less coercive alternative measures cannot be applied 
effectively.

that the existence of

was n
ot sufficient to meet Article 28. The Cou
rt rul
ed that the objective criteria to 
define a 

risk of absconding

 
must be established in a binding provision of national 
law.
 
 
When 
considering whether or not to detain an individual in order to secure transfer 
under Dublin, 
the provisions in the
 
Transfer for Determination of an Application for 
International Prote
ction (Detention) (Significant Risk of Absconding Criteria)

must be applied.

Section 60 of the Immigration Act 2016
 
has limited the
 
detention 
of pregnant wome
n 
who are being returned (or deported) 
to a normal maximum of 72 hours, though this 
can be extended to an absolute ma
xim
um of 
one week with Ministerial authorisation
.
 
 
For further guidance 
on detention 
please see
 
Chapter 55 of the Enforcement 
Instructions and Guidance

Calculating the detenti
on 
period
 
In all cases, but in particular where an individual is detained, steps to secure the 
transfer must be made as quickly as possibl
e. Article 28 sets out that detention shall 
be for as short a period as possible and shall be for no longer than the 
time
 
reas
onably necessary to fulfil the required administrative procedures with due 
diligence until the transfer under this Regulation is c
arried out.
 
 
There are strict timescales 
where a person is in detention
. Where a person is 
detained from the start of
 
the
 
Dubl
in procedure, a take charge or take back request 
must be made within one month of the application being lodged. An urgent reply 
sh
ould be requested in all such cases. When an urgent reply is requested, it must be 
given by the other 
Dublin
 
State wi
thin
 
two 
weeks of receipt of the request. Failure to 
reply within the two
-
week period shall be tantamount to accepting the request and 
enta
ils the obligation to take charge or take back the person, including the obligation 
to provide for proper arrangement
s fo
r arr
ival.
 
 
Where a person is 
already detained
 
at 
either 
of the following events:
 
 

 
the time that the request is accepted, whether impli
citly or explicitly
 

 
if the person lodges a challenge to the transfer decision, then the point at which 
that challenge
 
no 
longe
r has suspensive effect
 
 
the transfer of that person shall be carried out as soon as practically possible, and at 
the latest 
withi
n 6 weeks
 

 
 


same 
way as other Dublin time 
limits (
Article 42
 
of the Dublin III Regulation explains how to calculate time limits in 
the Regulation).
 
 
When the requesting 
Dublin
 
State fails to comply with the deadlines for submitting a 
take charge or take b
ack request o
r whe
re the transfer does not take place within the 
period of 6 weeks referred to above, the person must be released.
 
 
Time spent in de

ongoing with another State or is awaiting a re
ply, does 
not
 
coun
t towards the 6 week 
period. Equally, if a person is detained for a period following the acceptance by the 
receiving State of the 
transfer request, and subsequently seeks appeal or review of 
that decision, the period of time spent in dete
ntion prior t
o the
 
conclusion of the 
appeal or review does 
not
 
count towards the 6 week period.

If the person is detained at the point at which the
ir challenge no longer has 
suspensive effect, but is released shortly afterwards (for example following a 
successful appl
icati
on for bail), any previous period of detention does 
not
 
have to be 
added when t
he person is detained again, so the 6 week period r
e
-
starts.

(September 2017)
.
 
 
W
here a person is not detained upon either of the Re
levant Dates
, the 6 week 
period is not relevant. However, removal should take place as quickly as possible, 
and, where a 
perso
n is detained after a request has been accepted and any 
challenge is no longer 
suspensive, any detention should be for a period le
ss than 2 
months.

option in cases where there is only limited circumstantial evidence that another

Making a 
f
ormal 
request to another State to take responsibility
 
There are 
two
 
ways in which a formal
 
request can be made to another 
Dub
lin State
 
to take responsibility for the consideration of an asylum claim lodged in the UK: to 
take 
charge 
or to take 
back
. These 
are set out in detail 
below
.
 
 
The
 
Dublin III Regulation contains 
strict time limits for taking action
 
as set out in 
Article
s 2
1, 23
 
and 24.
 
I
t is 
essential 
that 
you 
adhere to these
, as f
ailure to do so will 
result in the UK becoming responsible for the con
sideration of a case by default
,
 
even where that responsibility should lie with another 
Dublin State
 
based on the 
application 
of the criteria in the 
Dublin III 
Regulation
.

The Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled on the timefr
a
mes for making 
requests, including those based on Eurodac evidence in the case of 
Mengesteab C
-
670
/16
 
(July 2017).
 
 
Note
: The discretionary provisions in Article 17
(
2) of the
 
Dublin III
 
Regulation permit 
the 
Dublin
 
State carrying out the process of determining the responsible Dublin State 
or t
he responsible State at any time before a first decision on 
the substance of an 
asylum claim is taken to request another Dubli
n
 
State to take charge of an applicant 
in order to bring together any family relations on humanitarian grounds b
ased
 
in 
particular
 
on family or cultural considerations
.
 
If a caseworker encou
nters a case 
where the normal time limit for making a formal reque
s
t to another Dublin State has 
expired, including where the case is 
being considered substantively in the UK, TCU 
may use this pro
vision in cases concerning family ties to another Dublin Sta
te;
 
the 
case should be referred immediately to a senior caseworker
 
in TCU to consider the 
facts of the individual case.
 
 
Take charge requests should be submitted through DubliNet using Annex I of 
Implementing Regulation 1
1
8/2014
. 
The proof and circumstantial evidence which 
need to accompany a take charge request 
is
 
listed in Annex II. 
Further infor
mation 
on how to make a 
take charge 
request 
including
 
the us
e of standard forms can be 
found in Article 21 of the Dublin III R
e
gulation 
and also in 
Commission Implementing 
Regulation (EC) No. 1560/2003
 
as amended and supplemented by 
Implement
ing 
Regulation 118/2014
.
 
C
aseworkers must be familiar with the lis
t
s on the 
relevant elements of proof and circumstantial evidence
.
 
 
It is important to note that when making a request to take char
ge
,
 
Article 21(2) of 
the 
Dublin III 
Regulation 
allows a 
Dublin State
 
to ask for an urgent reply
.
 
T
he 
request for urgency must 
s
tate the reasons for the request and the period within 
which an urgent reply is expected, which shall be at least one week. Furth
er details 
on the circumstances when a request 
for urgency on the part 
of
 
the requested State 
is appropriate are in 
Article 21
(
2)
, that is where the asylum claim was lodged after:
 
 

 
leave to enter or remain was refused
 

 
an arrest for an unlawful stay

vice or execution of a removal decision/order

Take back request
 
Article 23
 
of Dublin III concerns the procedure for submitti
ng
 
a 
take back request
 
when a new 
asylum claim 
has been lodged in the UK. A take back request must be 
made as quickly as possible 
and in any event:
 
 

 

within 2 
months 
of receiving the 
fingerpri
nt
 

hit

 

 
if based on evidence other than that from Eurodac it shall be made 
within 3 
months of the date on which the 
claim
 
for as
ylum was lodged
 
in the UK
 

 
if an applicant is detained then the
 
period for submitting a
 
request shall 
not exceed 1 month from t
he
 
lodging of the 
claim
 
(Article 28(3) of Dublin III)
 
 
Take back requests sho
uld be submitted through DubliNet using Annex III of 
Implementing Regulation 1
18
/2014
. 
Further information on how to make a take back 
request including th
e use of standard forms can be found in Article 23 of
 
the Dublin 
III Regulation and also in 
Impl
em
enting Regulation 1560/2003
 
as amended and 
supplemented by 
Implementing Regulation 118/2014
.
 
 
Article 24
 
concerns 
the procedure when no new 
claim for asylum 
has been l
odged 
in the UK but there is evidence that one has been lodged in another State, for 
example where a Eurodac fingerprint match
 
r
esulting from a transmission made to 
Eurodac for a person found illegally p
resent in the UK which matches with fingerprint 
data 
stored in Eurodac because of a previous 
claim 
for asylum in another State. The 
same deadlines apply for making requests as set
 
o
ut above in relation to Article 23. 
Article 24(4) of the Dublin III Regulat
ion provides an alternative mechanism for 
Dublin Stat
es
 
that are 
also 
bound by the Directive on Returns 2008/115/EC
. 
T
he UK 
does not participate in
 
this Directive and
 
so is unable
 
t
o choose the alternative 
mechanism outlined in Article 24(4)
 
of the Dublin III 
Regulation
.

In the same way as it sets out time limits for making requests to another 
Dublin 
State
,
 
the Dublin 
III 
Regulation also cont
ain
s provisions on deadlines for replies to 
requests. The time
 
limits are different depending on the situation.
 
 
The time limits f
or 
replies to requests to take charge
 
are set out in Article 22 of 
the 
Dublin II

A reply must be given within 2 m

,
 
b
ut there are exceptions
 
in the following situations
:
 
 

 
when the requesting 
Dublin State
 
has p
leaded urgency (Article 21(1) of the 
Dublin 
III 
Regulation refers)
,
 
the requested 
Dublin State
 
must make every effort 
to compl
y w
ith that request for urgency
:
 
o
 
if in exceptional circumstance
s it is not possible to do so because the 
examination of the request
 
is particularly complex, the requested State may 
give its reply after the time limit requested, but in any event within 1 mo
nth
 
of 
receiving the request

    if an applicant is detained then t

ticle 28(3) of Dublin III)
  The time limits for 
replies to requests to take back
 are 
set out in Article 25 of 
the 
Dublin III
 Regulation
. A reply must be given as quickly as 
possible, and no later than 
one of the following:
   one month from the date on which
 the request was received
  2 weeks from the date on which the request was received if the request to take 
back was based on ev
idence from the Eurodac database
  if an applicant is detained then the period for replying to a request is within 2 
weeks of receipt
 (Article 28(3) of 
the 
Dublin III
 Regulation
)  If the requested State 
fails to reply within the time limits
 set out in the Du
bli
n III 
Regulation
, the Regulati
on provides that this failure is tantamount to accepting the 
request and shall entail the obligati
on to take

 or take 
back
 of the person

making
 a take charge request with reference 
to Article 8 of

  In the event of a
 negative reply 
to a take cha
rge or take back request, it is open to 
the req
uesting State to challenge the refusal 
if it feels that the refusal was based on 
a misapp
raisal, or when it has additional evidence to put forward,
 by asking that its 
formal request be re
-examined. The CJEU in
 X and X C
-47/17, C
-48/17 confirmed 
that this m
ust be done within 3 weeks of the receipt of the negative reply. The 
requested Dublin Sta
te s
hall strive to reply to a re
-examination request within 2 
weeks.

However, 
in X
 
and X 
the CJEU also ruled that if 
a reply
 
to the request for re
-
examination is no
t received within 2 weeks that process ends and the requesting 
Dublin State retains respon
sibi
lity, unless it is possible to make a new request to 
take back or take charge within the time limits in Dublin III.
 
A
 
rejected request can 
only trigger one re
-
exa
mination procedure, it is not possible to call for 
repeated 
re
-
examinations in the same pr
oced
ure. 
Only a new request to take charge or take 
back, if rejected, would attract the possibility of a new re
-
examin
ation request (of that 
new rejection). 
In case
s involving the humanitarian provisions in Article 17(2) of 
Dublin III a request can be made
 
at 
any time before a first decision is made on the 
substance of the asylum claim.

the tr
ansfer
 
Where the requested Dublin State accepts responsibility for consideration of the 

the r
elevant provisions of 
Schedule 3 
to the As
ylum an
d Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004
 
must take 
place. 
This will include the consideration of any claims or allegat
ions 
that removal 
from the UK and / or treatment
 
in the responsible State in question would amount to 
an interference
 
with th

Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It is essential that all matters rais
ed sh
ould 
be fully answered with reference to relevant 
case law
. If a human rights claim or 
allegation against remova
l is con
sidered to be 

clearly unfounded

 
and therefore 
rejected
,
 
the removal decision from the UK will not attract an in
-
country statutory
 
righ
t of appeal 

 
see Schedule 3 to the 2004 Act
 
(as above)
. This means that the 
effective remedy against the remova
l decisi
on is in the form of a judicial review 
against either
,
 
or both the third country and 

clearly unfounded

 
certification or 
certifica
tions
.
 
Any representations which may have been received on behalf of the 
applicant must be answered before the case i

ied
.
 
 
The
 
Dublin III Regulation contains provisions concerning the transfer of applicants 
once responsibility has been accepted. Th
is in
cludes time limits within which the 
transfer must take place. Article 29 of 
the 
Dublin III 
Regulation 
provides t
hat the 
transfer 
sha
ll be carried out after consultation between the
 
Dublin States
 
concerned 
as soon as practically possible but
 
either:
 
 

 
w
ithin
 
6 months of the acceptance of the request to take charge or take back
 

 
within 6 months of the final decision on 
an 
appeal or review that has 
suspensive effect (the applicant cannot be removed
 
or 
transferred until that 
procedure has been completed)
 
 
Wh
ere t
he transfer does not take place within the 6
 
month deadline
,
 
responsibility is 
transferred t
o
 
the requesting Sta
te.
 
But the deadline can be extended
 
up to a 
maximum of
:
 
 

 
one year if the transfer cannot take place due to imprisonment of the person
 

 
18 m
onths
 
if the person concerned absconds

specifying that an applicant for international pr

If the applicant does not hold travel documents the transfer can take place quickly 
without the need to obtain other forms of t

explains the process 
when an a
sylum 
claim
 
has been lodged in 
another 
Dublin State
 
and there is evidence to suggest that the UK may be 
responsible 
for 
taking charge of the applicant to 
examin
e
 
his or her
 
claim 
under the 
Dublin 
III 
Regulation
 
or where the 
UK is being asked to take back a

has 
previously lodged an asylum claim 
in the UK
.

Another 
Dublin State
 
will
 
submit a request for consideration of responsibility of an 
asylum claim to the UK 
authorities
 
in the
 
same way as 
the UK makes requests to 
other 
Dublin States

As per Article 8(1), if
 
the applicant is an 
unaccompanied

the
 
responsible 
Dubli
n 
State
 
shall be that where a 
qualifying 
family member (insofar as 
the family existed in 
the count
ry of origin, the mother
, 
father or another adult responsible by the law or 
practice of the 
Dublin State
 
where the adult is present 

 
as 
per
 
Article 2(g)) or 
sibling 
is legally present provided that is in the best interests o
f the 
child
.
 
For Article 8(1) 
c
ases, where the family member or sibling cannot accommodate the child, the UK 
has an obligation to accept the take charge request, provided 
it is in the best 
interests of the child and all other criteria and requirements are 
met.
 
 
As stated under Article 8
(2), w
here another relative (adult aunt
, 
uncle or grandparent 

 
as per Article 2(h)
)
 
is
 
legally present 
and
 
where it can be established that
 
the 
relative can 
take care 
of the 
child
 
and 
it is in the best interests of the child
, 
then the 
Dublin State
 
where t
he relative i
s present shall be responsible.
 
Article 8(2) presents 
an additional requirement (compared to 8(1)) on being able to demonstrate

In order to accept the take charge request, t
here
 
must be 
evidence the

Such evidence should be provided by the UK based relatives to the EIU
 
and Local Authori
ties. 
 
 
Both Articles 8(1) and 8(2) require the transfer to be in the best interests of the child.
 
The best interests of the child must always be a primary consideratio

Article 12 als
o acknowledges that there may be cases 
where family members,

which the child is present must cooperate with the State(s) c
oncerned to determine: 
 
 

 
the
 
strength of the fam
ily links between the child and the dif
ferent persons 
identified across the Du

the capacity and availability of the persons concerned to take case of the

the transfer shall

Dublin
 
state concerned. In circumstances 
wher
e the UK has accepted the TCR by default, the requesting member state is

The UKVI role is to

c
onsideration
 
Section 55 of the 
Borders, Citizenship 
and Immigration Act 2009
 
places a statutory 
safeguarding duty on the Home Secretary
, who is required
 
to make arrangements:
 
 

To ensure that immigration, asylum, nationality and customs functions a
re 
discharged having
 
regard to the need to safeguard and pr
omote the welfare of 
children in the UK

 
 
In respect of 
the 
Dublin III
 
Regulation
, the section 55 obligation applies only where a 
child is physically present in the UK. It is for the requesting Sta
te to be satisfied t
h
at 
the request they are making is in k

 
 
Full guidance on the UK legislation can be found in 
part 1, paragraph 1.4 of the
 
Every 
C
hild Matters: Change for 
C
hild
ren
.
 
This provides further guidance on the 
extent to which the spirit of the duty should be applied to children who are overseas.
 
 
When considering a request to transfer an unaccompanied 
child
 
to 
the UK 
under the 
Dubl
in 
III 
Regulation
,
 
you must adhere to 
the spirit of the section 55 duty and careful 
consideration must be given to their safeguarding and welfare needs in assessing 
their
 
best interests. You must work with local 
statutory child safegua
rding 
agencies in
 
the
 
UK in
 
order to develop arrangements t
hat protect children and reduce the risk of 
trafficking and 
exploitation
.
 
 
The re
-
establishment of family links would normally be re
garded as being in 
accordance with the section 55 duty, but this 
may not always be the
 
case. 
Whilst
 
a 
non
-
exhaustive
 
list
, t
he re
-
establishment of family links would not be in accordance 
with section 55
, for example,
 
if it is identified that:
 
 

 
the safety o
f the child or their family will be jeopardised
 

 
the child has a w
ell founded fear of r
elevant family members 
 

 
the relevant f
amily members are the alleged actors of persecution within the 
claim for asylum which has not yet been finally determined
 

 
the 
child is a recognised or potential victim of trafficking in which the f
amily 
were knowingly 
complicit
 

 
the child has shown to have 
been previously exploited or abused or neglected 
by their family, or claims to have been previously exploited or abused or 
neg
lected by their family and this has not been conclusively discounted
 
 
I
t is important that 
y
ou
 
demonstrate and record how 
you
 
have
 
considered
 

best interests in line with
 
the section 55 duty.
 
A
ll aspects of this consideration must 
always be clearl
y recorded both on 
the 
case file and on 
CID

Sponsorship undertaking i
n cases involving una
ccompanied children 
(Article 8 of the 
Dublin III Regulation)
 
A sponsorship undertaking form 
must 
be sent to their family member or relative in 
the UK and representative (where notification is given) as soon as a transfer request 
is re
ceived. 
Seven
 
days mus
t be given to complete and return th
e form. If it is not 
returned within this time limit you m
ust pursue return by telephone, if a number is 
available, or by a sending a further letter requesting a 
response
.
 
 
Whilst not a legal requir
ement of 
either 
the Du
blin III Regulation or Implementing 
Regulation, the sponsorship undertaking form will require 
the family to state clearly 
whether they are willing and able to receive the child. It will bring to the attention of 
the UK family member o
r relative, their obli
gations and responsibilities, and it
 
will 
provide them the opportunity to raise any issues or 
questions about their obligations

y
ou 
must be satisfied when considering a

in addition
 
to
 
the family member

or 

having been confirmed
,
 
the transfer must 
also

.
 
 
The term 

legally present

 
contained within Article 8
 
is 
not
 
defined in the
 
Dublin III

it
 
has a larger scope than 

legally resident

document

 
is defined in Article 
2(l) of Dublin III as:
 
 

A
ny authorisation issued by the authorities of a Member State authorising a third

co
untry national or a sta
teless person to stay on its 
te
rritory, including the 
documents substantiating the authorisation to remain on the territory under 
temporary protection arrangements or until the circumstances preventing a 
removal order from being carr
ied out no longer apply
, with the exception of visas
 
a
nd residence authorisations issued during the period required to determine the 
Member State responsible as established in this Regulation or during the 
examination of an application for international pr
otection or an applicat
ion for a 
residence permit
.
'
 
 

Legally present

 
in the UK 
includes, in addition to all persons holding a residence 
document
 
(as above), 
any other person allowed to stay 
in the UK 
as an applicant 
for asylum 
(including 
a person 
under a

), 
a 
person holding a valid visa, 
leave 
to enter or remain or a 
person awaiting 
a decision to vary existing leave to enter or

not
 
include persons without valid leav

ag
ainst their removal, including persons who have 
exhausted their statutory appeal rights in the UK or persons who are in the UK on

Other family cases 
 
Whilst Article 8 
of
 
the
 
Dublin III 
Regulation 
deals specifically w
ith 
unaccompanied 
child
re
n
,
 
a formal request to transf
er an applicant may be also made on Articl
e 9 
grounds if a family member has been allowed to remain in 
a 
Dublin State
 
(
for 
example
,
 
as 
a 
beneficiary of international protection
 
-
 
grant
ed
 
refugee status 
or 
Humanitarian Protectio
n 
in the UK
)
. 
A transfer requ
est may 
also 
be made under 
Article 10 if the family member is an 
asylum 
applicant 
whose 
asylum claim 
has not 
yet been the subject of a first decision on the substance of the 
claim
.
 
 
Dependency and 
d
iscr
etionary 
provisions
 
Provi
s
ions on family dependency a
nd discretionary provisions may also apply, as set 
out in Articles 16 and 17 of the Dublin III 
Regulation
.
 
 
Where it is established that a
 
situation of 
dependency
 
exists 
between an applicant, 
their chil
d
, sibling 
or parent
,
 
Dubl
in 
States shall normally kee
p or bring together the 
parties
 
as expressed 
in Article 16. 
Article 16
 
explicitly states that 
the dependency 
must be on account of pregnancy, new born child, serious illness, or old age. T
he 
person in t
he UK must be 
legally 
resi
dent
 
which means that they m
ust have valid 
leave to enter or remain (this is in contrast to the term 

legally present

 
in Article 8 of 
the 
Dublin III
 
Regulation
, which includes an asylum applicant awaiting a decision on 
his or her
 
claim).
 
 
Article 16 furth
er states t
he family tie mus
t have existed in the country of origin and 
exercise
 
of the 
A
rticle
 
is subject to the condition that the child, sibling, or parent is 
able to take care of the

or vice versa
. 
In 
the
se
 
ca
ses,
 
the p
ersons 
concerned
 
must 
express their 
consent
 
to reunion in writing
.
 
When applying Article 16 
evidence of family ties and dependency must be raised before a 
Dublin State
 
has 
accepted responsibility following a take charge or take back request and b

protection.
 
 
Article 17
 
is a discretionary clause which
 
sits outside of Chapter III of the hierarchy 
criteria. It
 
allows a Dublin State to
 
exercise discretion and 
e
xamine an asylum claim 
even 
if it is not its responsibility under the criteria laid out in the
 
Dublin III
 
Regulation. 
Article 17(2) is relevant to 
family unity 
cases where an applicant for asylum is in 
another Dublin State
 
(a form
al asylum claim must have 
been lodged)
 
and there are 
f
amily relations in the UK. 
Article 17(2) can only be applied if all persons give their 
consent and a formal request by 
the Dublin State in which the applicant is 
present/the responsible State, must be m
ade before a first decisio
n on the claim for 
asylum is
 
taken.
 
 
Article 17
(
2
)
 
provides 
that a 
Dublin State 
may
 
(at any time before a first decision 
regarding the substa
nce is taken) request another to take charge of an applicant in 
order to bring together a
ny family relations on hum
anitarian grounds.
 
Written
 
consent 
is required from the persons concerned in Article 17
(
2
) as part of the request.
 
 
Where an Article 17
(
2
)
 
re
quest is received from another 
Dublin State
, caseworkers 
should 
consider
 
whether there ar
e any exceptional circumst
ances or compassionate 
fac
tors which may justify 
the UK exercising discretion and 
accepting responsibility for 
the claim
, notwithstanding tha
t the UK is not bound to do so under the 
Dublin III 
Regulation. 
There may be exceptional 
circumstances raised 
by th
e evidence 
submitted with 
the request from the other Dublin State 
which would result in 
unjustifiably harsh consequences for 
the applicant or their family relations. 
It is for 
the requesting 
Dublin State
 
to demonstrate what the ex
ceptional circumstances or
 
compassionate factors are
 
in their case
: the evidence submitted w
ith the request to 
exercise discretion must be coherent, verifiable and detailed in line with the
 
Dublin III 

 
 
Each 
requ
est 
must be decided on its
 
individual merits
.
 
H
oweve
r, s
ituations in which it 
would be appro
priate to exercise discretion will be rare
 
and on an exceptional basis
. 
In considering whether or not to exercise discretion caseworkers should act 
consistently wit
h the Immigration Rules an
d policies on family membe
rs, for example 
the Immigration Rules Ap
pendix FM 

 
Family Members.
 
 
Caseworkers must discuss with a senior caseworker any 
case where 
the exercise of 
discretion under Article 17(2) may be appropriate 
befo
re
 
accepting a request.

This page tells you about the timescales for replying to a f

The same

the UK
 
to
 
respond to requests 
to take

Dublin States
 
responding to requests from the UK. Information on

Note:
 
If 
EIU 
fails to r

to a formal request
 
within the time limits
 
set o

Dublin III Regulation
, the Regulation
 
provides that this failure is tantamount to 
accep

obligation to provide fo

g
uidance un
like TCRs lodged under other articles, requests made under Article 17(2) 
are not subject to the default acceptance provisions of Article 22 (7). This is due to 
the discretionary nature o
f the article which expr
essly recognises that the sta
te to 
w
hom the request has been made is not otherwise responsible. 
 
 
The only 
other 
exception to this rule is when considering a request to take charge of 
an unaccompanied 
child
 
made with reference to A
rticle 8 of Dublin III, a
s set out 
earlier in this gui
dance 
(for example on 
timescales
).
  
Article 12
(2) of the 
Implementing Regulations states that the duration of procedures for placing a minor 
child may lead to a failure to
 
observe the time limits s
et out in the Dublin 
Regulati
ons, however, a failure to observe the time limits should not necessarily be 
an obstacle to continuing the procedure for determin
ing 
the state responsible or 
carrying out a transfer. 
 
 
 
Imple
menting the decision
 
Refusing the 
f
ormal request
 
If, having carri
ed out the necessary checks and considered the evidence, it is not 
established that the UK is the State responsible for examining the asylum claim a 
negative reply must be sent to the reque
sting State through 

DubliNet

 
explaining the 
full reasons for 
refusal.
 
 
The Dublin III Regulation is intended to enable responsibility for an asylum claim to 
be determined swiftly within set timeframes. In some cases,
 
where a caseworker 
forms a
 
prelimin
ary view that the TCR should be
 
refused they may, depending on the 
nature o
f the proposed reasons for refusal and the time remaining within the Dublin 
timeframes, consider it appropriate to notify the claimed family memb
er(s) of the 
proposed reasons for re
fusal so as to give them an opp
ortunity to respond. 
Caseworkers are encoura
ged to provide this opportunity, if time allows and it is 
reasonable to do so. In deciding whether to afford such an opportunity
,
 
it
 
may be 
relevant 
to consider 
the extent to which 
family member(s) have already b
een given 
the opportunity to be
 
involved in the process and the cause for any delay in the 
decision making process.
 
Due to the strict Dublin III timeframes, caseworkers 
should
 
require a response within 
a maximum of 
7 days. It
 
should also be made clear 
that
 
only new evidence not alrea
dy submitted should be provided. Case workers 
should also
 
keep a record of any consideration given to notifying the claimed family 
member(s) in thi
s way
.
 
 
If the requesting State believes the refu
sal is based on a misappraisal, 
or has 
additional evi
dence to put forward, it may ask for the request to be re
-
examine
d 
under Article 5 of Implementing Regulation 1560/2003. A request must be made 
within 3 weeks of receipt of the refusal to accept transfer
. Upon receipt of a 
reconsiderat
ion request, reasonab
le endeavours should be made to respond within 2 
weeks. If it is 
not possible to respond within two weeks despite reasonable 
endeavours then the requesting State is responsible for considering the asylum
 
claim, subject to the requestin
g State making a subs
equent fresh request
 
for 
example
 
under 
Article 17(2) of the Dubl
in III Regulation to bring together family 
relations. Any such fresh request should be 
based on all the material available

(including the m
aterial provided with any previo
us requ
ests) and consideration given 
to whether an unaccompanied child who
 
has not yet received a decision on their 
claim for asylum should be accepted for transfer to the United Kingdom on best 
interests grounds.  
 
 
Where b
est interests enquiries are stil
l ongoi
ng at the end of the 2
-
week period for 
responding to a re

examinati
on request, consideration should be given to reminding 
the requesting State, in the response to the re
-
examination request, of its ability to 
make a f
resh request under Article 17(2)

ure should a decision on the 

tanding.

cases, it is accepted that the UK is
 
the responsible State for examining 
the asylum 
claim 
you must formally notify 

Dubli

. 
You 
must specify 
which 
Art
icle the 
request 
has been accepted u

Implementing the transfer
 
Ar
ticle 29 of the 
Dublin III 
Regulation sets out that
,
 
if necessary, the applicant shall 
be supplied with a 
laissez passer
 
by the requesting State to fac
ilitate travel.
 
The 
laissez passer
 
is a temporary travel document use
d for the purpose of the Dublin 
III 
Regulation which means that if the individual does not hold travel documents the 
transfer can take place quickly without the need to obtain 
o
ther form
s
 
of travel 
documentation.
 
A copy o
f the standard laissez passer is an
nexed to 
Implementing 
Regulation 118/2014
.
 
 
Once the requesting State has been formal
ly notified of the decision to acc
ept 
their 
request 
and 
the
 
transfer 
details 
have been agreed
,
 
you must n
otify Border Force of 
the date, time and location of arrival
 
so as to ensure that the transfer can be 
smoothly 
implemented
.
 
 
Once the applicant arrives
 
in the UK, Border Force and in
-
co
untry processes
,
 
such 
as fingerprinting, 
will commence
 
and the case mus
t be routed into the asylum 
process
 
in accordance with normal procedures
 
for examining asylum 
claim
s in the 
UK
. 
Where a
 
substantive decision has been p
reviously taken on the asylum 
clai
m 
in 
the UK, or t
he 
claim 
was withdrawn after a substantive decision wa
s made 
in the UK
, 
the case will be subject to 
the 
further submission process.
 
 
For further guidance please see the instruction on 
further submissions

In cases involving the 
transfer of unaccompanied 
children

of biometric information. If it is not possible to register the asylum claim at the port of

attended.
