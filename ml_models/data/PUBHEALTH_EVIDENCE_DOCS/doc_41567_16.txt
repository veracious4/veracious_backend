 The Department for Health and Social 
Care publishes weekly statistics on NHS Test and 
Trace (England) and Coronavirus (COVID
-19) 
testing 
in the UK,
 across all four testing 
pillar
s. The purpose of this 
publication 
is to provide a weekly update on the implementation 
and performance of NHS Test 
and Trace in England and Testing in the UK.
  For NHS Test and Trace (England), this includes:
 Testing
  People tested for coronavirus (COVID
-19), England
  People testing positive for coronavirus (COVID
-19), England
  Time taken for test results to become availa
ble, England
 Contact Tracing
  People transferred to the contact tracing system, and the time taken for them to be 
reached, England
  Close contacts identified for complex and non

  Number of tests sent out, UK
  Number of tests processed, UK
 Data collected for 
NHS Test and 
Trace is primarily for operational purposes and was not 
designed to track the sprea
d of the virus. Studies into the spread of the virus in the UK are 
carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). 
A list of data sources relating to the 
coronavirus pandemic in the UK can be found at 
Coronavirus (COVID

-00  6   1. NHS Test and Trace
  NHS Test and Trace was launched 
in England
 on 28
th May and ensures that anyone who 
develops symptoms of coronavirus (COVID
-19) can quickly be tested to find out if they 
have the virus. It then helps trace recent close contacts of anyone who tests positives for 
coronavirus and, if necessary, notifies them 
that they must self 
-isolate at home to help 
stop the spread of the virus. The flow of how people move through the NHS Test and 
Trace service is shown in Figure 1. More information about NHS Test and Trace can be 
found at 
NHS Test and Trace: How it Works.
   1.1 
Testing
 in England
 NHS Test and Trace starts with an individual taking a
n antigen
 test, either in 
pillar
 1 (testing in hospitals and outbreak locations
), pillar
 2 (nationa
l swab testing
) or 
pillar 4
 (prevalence
 studies
). Those who go on to test positive will have their case transferred to 
NHS Test and Trace for contact tracing.
  NHS Test and Trace is for England only, therefore the figures in this section are given for 
England. Figures for UK testing are given in 
Section 2
 and information on contract tra
cing 
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can be found directly from 
Public Health Scotland, 
the Welsh government and the Northern Ireland Public Health Agency

, 571,400
 people 
were 
newly 
tested 
for 
coronavirus (
COVID
-19) an increase of 27% compared to the 
previous week
. Since Test and Trace launched 
5,877,250
 people have 
been tested at least once
1. 
 There was a nota
ble increase 
of 27%
 in the number of people tested compared to the 
previous week
. This
 comprised of a 30% increase in the number of people tested under 
pillar 2 and a 20% increase in pillar 1
. The number of people tested gradually increased 
from mid
-June t
o the beginning of August but
 then
 level
ed off 
until the end of August
. In 
the most recent week, 
over twice as many people were tested compared to mid
-June.
 Since Test and Trace launched
 at the end of 
May, 5,877,250
 people have been tested
, of 
which 
67.9% were tested under 
pillar
 2 (national swab testing
) and 
32.1% under 
pillar
 1 (testing in hospitals and outbreak locations
).  Figure

, continuing the sharp upward trend in positive cases 
seen in the previous week. From the end of August t
here has been 
a substantial
 increase of 
167
%. The number of positive cases 
between 03 September and 09 September
 saw 
a substantial
 increase
 of 75%
 compared to the previous week
. This continues the sharp 
upwards trend
 in positive cases first seen between th
e end of August and the beginning of 
September, where there was an increase
 of 52%
 in positive cases
.  The number of positive cases declined each week between the end of May and the start of 
July before starting to gradually increase
 until the end of Augus
t. The number of positive 
cases in the most recent week 
is 108% higher than the 8,852 cases recorded at the end of 
May when Test and Trace launched.
  Since Test and 
Trace
 launched
, 102,394
 people newly tested positive for 
COVID
-193, 82.9% of these 
positive
 cases were tested under 
pillar
 2 in comparison to 
17.1% under 
pillar
 14. Between 
03 September
 and 
09 September
, the number of positive cases under 
pillar 1 
has 
increased by 
145% compared to the 
end of August
. There
 was
 a 169% increase in the number of positive cases under pillar 2
 over the same period.

may not always
 align with other published figures for people tested and people tested positive 
for COVID

pillars 1 and 2
 due to the timing of data cuts.

   The data for the most recent weeks can be found in the Annex, 
Table

testing turnaround times
, England
  Some 
pillar
 1 tests are conducted in a hospital setting, and it is therefore not practical for 
those administering the tests to record the exact time that a test was taken. 
Therefore
, the 
time taken to receive a coronavir
us (COVID
-19) test result is measured from the time that 
a test is received by a laboratory for processing to the time when the results are published 
to the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).
  The total tests given in figures for 
pillar
 1 turnaround times is not the same as the number 
of tests processed in 
pillar
 1 as 
study samples and 
tests from private 
laboratories
 do not 
report data on turnaround times.
 This data is only available from
 9 July
. More details can 
be found in the 
NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology.
  Almost 
9 out of 10 
pillar
 1 test
 results were made available within 24 
hours
 of the laboratory receiving the test
. This proportion has remained 
similar since reporting began 
on 
9 July
. Between 
03 September
 and 09 September, 
88.8
% of
 pillar 1 test results were made
 available within 24 hours.

, England
 There are 
various
 routes for 
getting tested within 
pillar
 2 (national swab testing
). Data on 
the time taken to receive a COVID
-19 test 
result 
for 
pillar
 2 is split up to reflect this
, as 
this
 impacts on the 
turnaround times
5. These routes 
include:
 o Regional Test Sites
, which includes drive
-through testing centres with limited 
walk
-up facilities. 
 o Local Test Sites
6, which are similar to 
regional test sites but specifically for 
walk ups.
 o Mobile Testing Units
, which travel around the UK to increase access to 
COVID
-19 testing. They respond to need, travelling to test people at specific 
sites including care homes, police stations and prisons.
 o Satellite Test Centres
, which includes test kits provided directly to ‚satellite™ 
centres at places like hospitals or care homes that have a particularly urgent 
or significant need.
 o Home Test Kits
, which are delivered to someone™s door so they can test 
themselves and their family without leaving the house.
 Turnaround times are 
measured 
and reported in 
two
 ways, 
time taken from booking a test 
and from taking a test to receiving a test result. More information on these definitions is in 
the 
terminology
 section
. Both measure
s are 
now 
reported as the median turnaround time, 
in addition to the usual turnaround time windows
, such as within 24 hours.
 All these 
measures are available in full in the accompanying data tables, however only time from 
taking a tes
t is discussed below.
 The total tests 
reported
 for 
pillar
 2 turnaround times is not the same as the number of tests 
processed in 
pillar
 2 as 
test processed is available for the UK (rather than for England
 only
). In addition, 
they are reporting on the numbe
r of
 tests 
at different stages in the 
process. 
Further
 detail is given in the 
NHS Test and Tra
ce statistics m
ethodology.
  After someone takes a test
, it
 is transported to a laboratory for processing. There are 
normal fluctuations in this operational process which can sometimes cause the time taken 
to receive a test result to go over 24 hours, but still be turned around the next day. Where 
appropriate ther
efore we also provide the number of tests turned around the day after a 
test was taken.
 Satellite tests are predominantly used by care homes who need greater control and 
flexibility over when test kits are collected. For example, tests may be conducted over 
 5 For all measures of time taken to receive a COVID
-19 test result, th
ere are a number of tests that were not completed. 
This covers any test where the results were not communicated, which may be because communication details (for 
example, phone number or email address) were not provided or were incorrect, or because the tes
t was cancelled or 
abandoned, or no result was available.
 It also includes some tests 
which are still being processed.

s but 
from 17 September have
 been split out 
as a separate group

o be 
posted to a person and be couriered back to the lab. Consequently, a low proportion of 
Home and Satellite test results will be available within 24 hours of the test being taken.
  The 
median time to receive a test result after taking a test 
has
 increas
ed for in
-person 
tests
 in the latest week
. In the first month of Test and Trace, 
there was an initial reduction in the median
 time taken 
to receive a test result 
for 
in-person tests (Regional Test Sites
, Local Test Sites
 and 
Mobile Testing Units
). This beg
an to gradually trend back up from the start of July 
until the 
end of August
.  Between 03 September and 09 September 
Regional Test Sites 
increased
 to 27 hours
 from 
20 hours
 in the
 previous
 week
. Local Test Sites increased to 35 hours up from 24 hours 
whilst 
Mobile Testing Units
 increased to
 26 
hours 
from
 19 hours during th
e same
 period. 
The 
total 
number of test results 
processed
 increased by 
13% compared to the previous 
week
.  Since the start of J
uly, the median time taken to receive a test result 
after taking a test has 
gradually
 increased for both Home Testing 
Kits/Satellite Test 
Centres. 
 In the first month of Test and Trace, 
Home testing Kits and Satellite test 
Centres
 also 
saw 
an initial
 reduction in the
 median
 time taken to receive a test result
. However,
 since the 
end of July, 
the median time has 
seen a notable increase for both these routes. 
 The median time taken
 to receive
 a test result from
 Satellite Test Centres 
has continue
d to 
increase
 from a low of 
26 hours in mid
-June to 
97 hours in the latest week.
 The median 
time for Home Testing Kits has 
increased from a low of 
35 hours at the beginning of July to
 82 hours in the most recent week
. In the most recent week,
 the number
 of test results 
processed
 for these routes 
is 
more 
than

Contact Tracing
 in England
 Once a person has a confirmed positive test result for coronavirus
7, this person is 
transferred to NHS Test and Trace and a case is opened for them. 
The number of positive 
cases transferred to the contact
 tracing system may not always align with the number of 
people testing positive for COVID
-19. There are several reasons f
or this which are outlined 
in the 
information for users
 document.
 Positive cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace are handled in different ways depending 
on their complexity. Positive cases linked to potential outbreaks in specific settings are 
handled by PHE Local Health Protection Teams, these are termed complex cases
, whereas those managed more generally by online and call centre capacity are termed 
non-complex cases. 
Further information is available 
in the 
NHS Test and Trace statistics 
methodology
.  Positive cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace
 The number of people transferred to the contact tracing system 
increased by 74% compared to the previous week
, a sharp increase in 
the upward trend seen from the beginning of August. 
 Between 
03 September 
and 09 September
, 15,526
 people were transferred to the contract 
tracing system
. The number of people transferred has been notably increasing since the 
beginnin
g of August with 
an increase of 223% 
in the most recent week compared to the 
beginning of August
 and 92% higher than
 when Test and Trace launched at the end of 
May.
 The number of people transferred gradually 
increase
d between the beginning of July and 
the 
beginning of August
. Since the beginning of 
August,
 the number of people transferred 
has had a steep upward trend
 with a substantial spike in the most recent week
. This aligns 
with the increase in the number of people testing positive for COVID
-19 during the same 
time period.
  7 All positive test results under 
pillar 1 and 
pillar 2 should be transferred. In addition, all positive 
swab 
test results as part 
of prevalence studies (
pillar 4) are also transferred to Test and Trace
. People tested under 
pillar
 3 (serology testing to 
show if people have antibodies from having had COVID
-19) do not have their cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace.

 In the most recent week, the median number of complex contacts provided per case 
has increased to 8 compared to 4 in the previous week
. For
 non-complex cases the median 
was 
3. This ha

-00 22 Close contacts identified by NHS Test and Trace
 The number of recent close contacts identified
 has 
steeply increased
 since
 the beginning of August
. The number of contacts identified is 89% 
higher in the most recent week compared to the previous week
.  Between 
03 September
 and 09 September
, 61,790 
people were iden
tified as recent close 
contacts
, of which 
43,849
 (71.0%)
 were no
n-complex 
and 
17,941
 (29.0%)
 were complex.
 The steep increase
 seen since the beginning of August
 in the number of contacts 
identified has been 
mainly 
driven by 
an increase
 of 300%
 in non
-complex
 contacts 
identified
. The number of complex contacts identified has increased by 179% 
over the 
same time period.
 The total number of 
complex 
close contacts identified 
had a steep decline between the 
start of co
ntact tracing and the end of June in comparison to the number of 
non-complex 
contacts which remained 
broadly 
consistent over the same time period.
 At the beginning of 
May complex contacts were 81.7% of contacts identified compared to only 29.0% in the 
most 
recent week. 
 As non
-complex cases have a higher proportion of con
tacts who are unable to be reached, 
this has contributed to the reduction in the overall percentage of contacts who were 
reached and asked to self
-isolate
 since Test and Trace launched
, from 
91.1% to 
73.9% in
 the latest week
. Considering only the contacts 
where 
communication
 details were provided, 
83.9% were 
reached and asked to self
-isolate
 in the most recent week
. Since Test and Trace 
launched, this is
 86.6%.

from the same household as the case 
they were identified from.
 The proportion of 
non
-complex 
close contacts from the same household as the case they 
were identified from has been steadily declining since Test and Trace launched
. Between
 03 September 
and 
09 September
, 57.1
% of non
-complex con
tacts were household 
contacts
 compared to 
74.8%
 at the start of Test and Trace.
 In the same period, 
60.3
% of these household contacts were successfully reached and 
asked to self
-isolate. This is in comparison to 
68.1
% for non
-complex contacts who were 
from a different household to the case from which they were identified. 
 It is likely that cases often advise 
their household members to self
-isolate in advance of 
these contacts being directly contacted by contact tracers. 
This results in these contacts 
not being recorded as reached and asked to self
-isolate,
 which may be a contributing 
factor to a lower proporti
on of household contacts being reached in comparison to non

 2.1 
Testing capacity in the UK, 
pillar
s 1 Œ 4  Coronavirus tests are processed in several separate labs. Projected lab capacity is an 
estimate of each lab™s constrained capacity each day based

 capacity
 is available 
in the

Number of tests sent out in the UK, pillar 2 and 
pillar 4
 Tests can be administered in different ways 
Œ tests taken at a hospital, mobile testing unit, 
regional testing sites or tests sent out to 
individuals at home or satellite locations. Tests 
sent out are only available as part of
 pillar 2 (antigen testing) and pillar 4 (antigen and 
antibody testing
). Not all tests sent out will be returned.
 It is not currently possible to compare the total numb
er of tests sent out with the total 
number of tests processed in pillar 2 and pillar 4, as given in Table 7. This is because tests 
sent out includes only tests sent to individuals at home or to satellite testing locations, 
while tests processed includes al
l tests that have remained within the control of the 
programme (and were counted at the time at which processed in labs) and those that have 
been sent out and subsequently returned to be processed in a lab.
 Further information is 
available in the 
NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology
. 1,160,953
 tests
 were sent out across the UK within pillar 2 between 
03 September
 and 
09 September
, continuing the upward trend since mid
-August
. During the same period no 
tests were sent out under pillar 4.
 The number of tests sent out has overall seen an 
upward trend si

Number of tests processed in the UK, 
pillar
s 1 Œ 4 The number of tests processed counts all tests that have remained within the control of the 
programme (and were counted at the time at which processed in labs) and those that have 
been sent out and subsequ
ently returned to be processed in a laboratory. 
They are 
counted at the time 
at which
 they were processed.
 This measure shows how many tests 
have been proce
ssed
, including both antigen testing (
pillar
 1, pillar
 2 and partial 
pillar

and antibody testing (
pillar
s 3 and 4). 
 Further details are available
 in the
 NHS Test and

. For 
pillar
s 1 and 2
, the number of tests processed in a laboratory is different to the number 
of test results received
 which is reported as part of the Test and Trace testing turnaround 
times for England. 
This is
 because they are 
reporting on
 the 
number of 
tests at different 
stages in the process
 as well as reporting different geographies (UK and England) and 
because some tests are excluded from the turnaround time counts. 
 Between 
03 September
 and 09 September
, 1,407,430
 tests were processed in total 
across 
pillar

 3.2 
Tracing
 NHS Test
 and Trace has two ways of handling cases depending on their complexity:
  Complex cases and contacts
 - PHE Local Health Protection Teams manage 
cases linked to outbreaks, examples include someone who works or has recently 
visited:
  a health or care setting, 
such as a hospital or care home
  a prison or other secure setting
  a school for people with special needs
  critical national infrastructure or areas vital for national security
  Non
-complex cases and contacts 
- Wider online and other call centre capacity for 
less complex cases.
 When a case is transferred to NHS Test and Trace contact tracers will attempt to contact 
the individual which results in one the following three outcomes:
  Reached and provided information about recent close contacts 
Œ contact 
tracers successfully reached the individual and asked them to provide details for 
recent close contacts
  No communication details provided
 - people who had no communication details 
provi
ded are those who were transferred to NHS Test and Trace but did not have 
any associated contact details (e.g. phone number or email address).
  Not reached 
- The number of people who were not reached includes those people 
who the service has been unable to 
reach because there has been no response to 
text, email and call reminders.
 It also includes people who were reached but 
declined to give details of close contacts. There may also be a small number of 
people who have not been reached but where contact trac
ers are still in the process 
of trying to make contact.

Measuring the data
  Department of Health and Social Care
 Statistical Bulletinv0
-00 34 4.1 
How the data were collected
 UK level testing data is 
collated centrally by DHSC from multiple sources across the 
different nations and 
pillar
s. Further details can be found i
n the
 NHS Test and Trace 
statistics methodology
. Testing data for 
pillar
s 1 and 2 
for
 England are provided by PHE
, NHS and commercial 
partners
. Contact tracing 
data are collected from management information from the NHS 
Test and Trace service.
 Details about 
the
 data
 sources 
used can be found 
in the 
NHS Test 
and Trace statistics m
ethodology
 document
. 4.2 
Future development
 We have integrated these data with those from other parts of
 NHS Test and Trace, 
particularly testing, to provide an end
-to-end view of the service that follows the user 
journey. So far, 
UK level testing data, 
testing dat
a for 
pillar
s 1 and 2
 in England
 and the
ir turnaround times have been added. Further breakdowns
 for contact tracing continue to be 
incorporated, including complex and non
-complex breakdowns
, geographical breakdowns
 and household information. 
 To support user needs and data transparency, additional releases have been published 
alongside the weekly Te
st and Trace publication including care home statistics up to 8 
July
, people tested for coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) 
between 30 January and 27 May
, weekly 
UK testing 
statistics since the start of testing
 and Demographic data for coronavirus testing 
in England between
 28 May 
and
 26 August
. NHS Test and Trace continues to provide information for local authorities and their 
partners so that they have the information they need to help contain any outbreaks.
 In 
tim
e, NHS Test and Trace intends to publish detailed data from across the program to 
support secondary analysis, for example in academic institutions. Over the coming 
months, we intend to make the following available:

  The UK Statistical Authority has published a

This includes recommendations on how the publication should develop it order to adhere 
fully to the Code of Practice. These recommendations continue to influence the 
development of the publication in the coming weeks and
 months.

Strengths and limitations
 Given the importance of this service and the commitment of NHS Test and Trace to be 
open and transparent with the public it serves, these data are being released at the 
earliest possible opportunity. 
However, new IT s
ystems and statistical outputs often take a 
period of time to bed in. 
These data should therefore be 
treated with caution 
as the system 
and understanding of the data develops.
 4.4 
Quality
 These statistics have been put together by NHS Test and Trace 
and DHSC 
with advice 
from the Office for National Statistics. 
 Revisions to figures previous published
 Figures for people tested and people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID
-19) in 
previous releases have been revised. These revisions are because:
  The
re are sometimes delays in laboratories submitting data to PHE.
  Quality checks are conducted on the data to refine figures over time.
  Figures for pillar 2 testing turnaround times in previous releases have been revised.
 These 
revisions are because:
  There has been a change in methodology for how the location of home tests and 
satellite tests is assigned. The new methodology uses the individuals home address 
instead of the address of the laboratory. This has resulted in an
 increase in the 
number of tests in England as a large number of tests from England were being 
processed in laboratories outside of England. 
  The figures presented are based on a data
-cut several days after the end of the 
reporting period. Some tests may c
ontinue to be being processed after this period 
and therefore data may need to be revised over time.
  Figures for contact tracing in previous releases have been revised. These revisions are 
because
:  The figures presented are based on a data cut several day
s after the end of the 
reporting period, to give time for cases reported towards the end of the 7
-day 
period to have an outcome. Some cases may continue to be in progress after this 
period, and therefore data may need to be revised over time. 
  Typicall
y, one week after initial publication the number of 
cases reached and 
consequently
 the number of contacts 
identified 
is expected to increase. 
Similarly
, the number of cases and contacts reached within 72 hours is 
likely to increase. 
  Cumulative figures for 
coronavirus (COVID
-19) testing in the UK have been revised. These 
revisions are because:

prev
iously reported figures, for example, where labs (or studies under pillar 4) 
returned the results late or duplicates were identified and removed. 
These 
corrections are reflected in the cumulative figures. This means that previously 
published weekly counts 
will not necessarily sum to the latest cumulative figure. It 
also means that the latest cumulative count may not match the previous week™s 
cumulative count plus this week™s weekly count.
  Historic data for 
tests sent out in pillar 2 has been revised due to 
more accurate 
data collection and reporting processes being adopted. Tests which were sent out 
on behalf of another channel were identified and consequently more tests have 
been sent to NHS Trusts and care homes than originally reported.
  More information 
on quality and how this publication adheres to the Code of Practice for 
statistics is available in the
