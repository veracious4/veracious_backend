 The money for the extra intervention and counseling has been ordered by Gov.
 John Kasich.
 Officials say they were working on the idea before the December school shooting in Connecticut put the spotlight on ways to prevent violence.
 Here’s Gov.
 Kasich: KASICH: "There are families that get themselves in a position where they have either a young child or maybe even an adult child that have very serious mental health problems.
 Comes about sometimes because people aren't taking their medications, or there are multiple medications that one person gets that really doesn't help this person."
 Mental health officials say the extra money could help pay for emergency treatment for mentally ill children who’ve been threatening violence.
 Or it could help their overwhelmed parents get a temporary break from their constant daily responsibilities of caring for their troubled child.
