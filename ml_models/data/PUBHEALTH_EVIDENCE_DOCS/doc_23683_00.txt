President Obama, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and Congressman Steve Driehaus (D-Ohio) promised that ObamaCare would not allow tax dollars to be used to take the life of unborn children.
 They have broken this promise, and they must now answer to the people they represent.
 The Stupak-Kaptur-Driehaus executive order, signed by President Obama, was not worth the paper it was printed on.
 It was merely a ploy to give so-called pro-life Democrats an excuse to vote for a federal takeover of health care that allows taxpayer funding of abortion.
 Pro-life members of Congress warned against this from day one.
 Pennsylvania is the first state where ObamaCare forces taxpayers to subsidize abortion.
 Which state will be the next?
 Jordan won the Pro-Life Legislator of the Year Award and the Defender of Life Award as a state legislator, and is a member of the Ohio Right to Life Pro-Life Hall of Fame.
