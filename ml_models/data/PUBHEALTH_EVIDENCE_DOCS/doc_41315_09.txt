 Methods:           We conducted a cross-sectional study of 9- to 13-month-old children recruited from an urban primary care center, excluding those with a history of renal disease or receipt of either aluminum-containing pharmaceuticals or parenteral nutrition.
 Aluminum levels were measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.
 Correlation with Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID) and vaccine-related aluminum load was assessed via linear regression models.
 Results:           The median age of 85 participants was 287 days.
 There was no significant correlation between B-Al or H-Al and estimated aluminum load from vaccines.
 B-Al was not correlated with BSID composite or subscale scores.
