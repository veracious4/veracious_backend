 First, a little background.
 A native of South Africa, Kim Clement introduced his unconventional brand of “prophetic” worship to the United States in 1981 and returned for multiple tours over the next 10 years before permanently resettling here in 1991.
 Clement’s events featured live performances that incorporated “prophetic worship” through “songs, prose, poetry, literature and dance, specifically expressed through music, Kim takes the hearer into the ‘presence’ of the Spirt and the ‘communication’ begins.” Clement died on November 23, 2016, at the age of 60 from what his family described in a statement as “pneumonia and complications due to his diseased lungs.”   Following President Trump’s election in November 2016, transcripts and audio of Kim Clement’s prophecies in 2007 and 2008 began circulating in YouTube videos and blog posts.
 They claimed that Clement had prophesied Trump’s presidency.
 Clement’s prophecies told of a remaking of news media and predicted Trump’s presidency becoming a “Trumpet of God.” This excerpt from an April 2008 event in Redding, California, is among the most widely circulated:“I am God and you have called to Me, and many from this Nation have said, ‘Enough–enough of religion and enough of dead speech.
 '” The Spirit of God said, “This is a moment of resurrection.” For the Spirit of God says, “Honor Me with your praise and acceptance of this that I say to you.
 This that shall take place shall be the most unusual thing, a transfiguration, a going into the marketplace if you wish, and into the news media.
 Where Time Magazine will have no choice but to say what I want them to say; Newsweek what I want them to say; and The View, what I want to say.”“Trump shall become a trumpet,” says the Lord!
 “I will raise up the Trump to become a trumpet and Bill Gates to open up the gate of a financial realm for the Church,” says the Spirit of the Living God!Clement actually made that remark; it’s online footprint goes all the way back to April 2007 — well before Donald Trump ran for president, or was ultimately elected.
 But it should be noted that Clement never specifically said Donald Trump would become president.
 And the fact that Clement referenced Donald Trump beside Bill Gates seems to imply that he was referring to two of the richest men of the day opening up “the gate of a financial realm” for the church — and not necessarily about politics.
 And Kim Clement prophesied frequently about future U.S. presidents over the 2007-2008 timeframe.
 Many excerpts from that period have since been applied to Clement prophesying Donald Trump’s presidency, but it appears that he was speaking specifically about the 2008 and 2012 elections at the time.
 This passage from August 2008, for example, has been applied to Trump’s presidency — but Clement specifically said “the next two terms in office,” which were both served by President Obama:God’s Spirit says, I’m waiting, I’m waiting for the response from My people throughout this land.
 Can somebody see victory?
 Can somebody see honor?
 For God says, let Me remind you I will place at your helm a President that shall pray to Me, says the Lord.
 He will pray to Me.
 And God says, in the next two terms there will be a praying President, not a religious one, for I will fool the people, says the Lord.
 I will fool the people, yes I will.
 God says, the one that is chosen shall go in and they shall say, he has hot blood.
 For the Spirit God says, yes he may have hot blood, but he will bring the walls of protection on this country in a greater way and the economy of this country shall change rapidly, says the Lord of Hosts.
 God says, I will put at your helm for two terms a President that will pray but he will not be a praying President when he starts.
 I will put him in Office and then I will baptize him with the Holy Spirit and My power, says the Lord of Hosts……And it should also be noted that Kim Clement prophesied about celebrities and the news media frequently in the 2000s.
 In 2006, for example, Kim Clement prophesied that “conversion shall come” to rapper Eminem would “be a voice” for the Lord, and to novelist Stephen King, who would “write for the Kingdom of God.” And Clement again tied those prophesies to major shifts in the American media landscape, using very similar language to Clement’s prophesies about Donald Trump:“This year, I will raise up Eminem to be a voice.
 Conversion shall come to his house–Eminem.
 This year I will touch Stephen King, and he will write for the Kingdom of God.
 This year, I will raise up Rupert Murdoch, who shall even stand before you.
 This year, there shall be a joining of networks–ABC being one of them, and they shall have a section where Christ will be glorified,” says the Lord.The media shall never be the same.
 For God said, “I have decided after your prayers and your faith that this is the year where I shall use the media to destroy the power of control and manipulation,” says the Lord.
