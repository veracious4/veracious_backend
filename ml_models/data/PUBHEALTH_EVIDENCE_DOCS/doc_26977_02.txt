She was a happy and caring 28 year old who many confused as teenager due to her spunk, laughter and her childlike antics.
 She was always doing what she could to make you laugh, but one evening on 8/29/2019, our lives would change forever.
 She was on her way to the arcade to meet up with friends with her boyfriend, and as they were crossing an intersection in the city of Downey, California, a distracted driver, ran a red light and struck Ariana and her boyfriend, Jason.
 Upon arrival to the hospital, Jason died 2 hours later from severe head trauma and on 8/30/2019, Ariana was also declared brain dead due to severe head trauma as well.
 Being that she was a kind and giving soul, donating her organs was something she would have wanted and because of that, she is helping 6 recipients to have a better life.
 Our Ariana is now in Paradise but her compassion and love will forever remain in our hearts and in those recipients’ lives.
 If you would like to help out the family to help cover her funeral costs, she has a gofundme account under Ariana Cervantes.
 Please help us reach our goal of $15k.
 Thank you.
