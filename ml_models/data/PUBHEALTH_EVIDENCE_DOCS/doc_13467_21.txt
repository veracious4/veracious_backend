 I appeared to be a high-level threat at one point in my life.
 Chris Weller/Business Insider     A few months ago, I was sitting in the terminal at Ben Gurion International Airport, in Tel Aviv, reading a fellow traveler&apos;s account of flying out of Israel.
 I&apos;d heard horror stories of strip searches and endless lines.
 I was curious what I was really up against.I wasn&apos;t surprised to learn security is top-notch.
 After all, I had already been searched and questioned twice, once through the window of my taxi and again before the terminal doors.
 All this and I hadn&apos;t even entered the airport yet.
 But then I read about the stickers.I learned that before any passenger ever gives up his luggage to the fine folks at Ben Gurion International, an employee places a neon yellow sticker on the back of your passport.
 On it is a 10-digit number.
 The first number, ranging from one to six, indicates your perceived threat level to whomever else you&apos;re passed along.I got a five.
 After I got back, I relayed this story to some friends who were more experienced traveling to and from Israel.
 My ego deflated a little to learn I didn&apos;t actually seem threatening, just more suspicious than average.For one, I&apos;m not Jewish.
 That automatically raises some red flags in a country fraught with religious and cultural conflicts.
 I was also on assignment as a reporter, traveling alone, without so much as an estranged second cousin I could say I knew.
 The profiling alarms had to be blaring.The system isn&apos;t official, just the sort of through-the-grapevine rumors that travelers seemed to have agreed is true.
 So I can&apos;t know for sure what would have happened had I gotten a six.
 But looking back, maybe I don&apos;t want to.As Lia Tarachansky wrote back in 2010 for Mondoweiss, while a one rating "is awesome," a six indicates that "you&apos;re f-----."
 It appears to be reserved for Palestinians, Muslims, and hostile internationals.
 Extreme, yes.
 But effective.No flight leaving Ben Gurion has ever been hijacked, and the airline servicing Israel, El Al, hasn&apos;t seen an attack in more than 30 years.Too bad the TSA has yet to find a workable system of their own.
