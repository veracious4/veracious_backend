 With that disability income excluded, veterans’ average income was $59,000, 9 percent less than nonveterans’ average income.
 Veterans age 72 or older had more income, on average, than nonveterans.
 Overall, veterans received more money from Social Security and retirement plans; nonveterans had more earnings from work and more investment income.
