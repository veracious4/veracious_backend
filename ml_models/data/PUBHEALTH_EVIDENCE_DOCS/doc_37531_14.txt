 From drinking water every 15 minutes to snorting cocaine, the myths range from the absurd to the truly dangerous.
 But the latest rumor is something we never expected to read: Blasting your nose and mouth with the hot air from a hair dryer will cure the virus.This theory became widely circulated following a YouTube and Facebook video — that have both since been removed after The New York Times pointed them out — that claimed that breathing in hot air from a sauna or blow dryer could kill the coronavirus.
 People stormed to social media platforms, including TikTok and Twitter, to either test out or share this claim.My mother is convinced that a hair dryer can cure Coronavirus— Liz (@liz_lecaroz) March 20, 2020Random Observation:There’s a video going around on WhatsApp detailing how to increase the temperature in your Nasal Cavity in order to kill Coronavirus, using a handheld hair dryer…I suspect it might be best to discuss with your doctor before trying that one.— Black_Saint 🇦🇬 (@ColinJohn_) March 16, 2020But is there any truth to this cure?
 Straightforwardly, no.
 While there have been reports of heat killing the virus, that’s in reference to the extreme heat used by medical professionals to clean their tools (not something you’d find in your average Conair or from the weather outside).In fact, this specific theory actually puts you more in danger as it could cause serious complications.
 “You could easily burn or more likely cause superficial damage to your eye, nose, and mouth lining by trying to breath in hot air, which promptly damages your first line of defense against infection — an intact lining,” says Jill Grimes, MD, urgent care physician and author of The ULTIMATE College Health Handbook .Story continuesBy damaging these parts of your body, you are actually making yourself more vulnerable to exposure.
 “Dry, irritated eyes, nasal passages, and mouth make you more susceptible to any respiratory infection because of that lost barrier,” Dr. Grimes adds.Impaired respiratory systems, especially for those with medical conditions like asthma, put you at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19, as stated by the CDC Foundation.
 It’s also important to remember that while there is currently testing for antiviral medications, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 currently available, which has also been confirmed by the CDC.The harm doesn’t end there.
 By breathing in air at high temperatures through your nose, you can also damage your skin.
 “The hot air can lead to potentially serious burns,” warns dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, MD.
 “I absolutely do not recommend breathing in hot air from your blow dryer.”If you are not infected, but fear breathing in the virus, there are ways to prevent the illness without inflicting harm.
 “The best thing is social distancing and keeping yourself away from large crowds where you may breathe in or catch the virus,” says Dr. Purvi Parikh, allergy &amp; infectious disease doctor and allergist with the Allergy &amp; Asthma Network.
 “Those prone to allergies or asthma should continue their controller nasal and respiratory medications so that they are protected from more serious complications of the illness as it does target the lungs.”As rumors continue to circulate on how to beat or prevent the virus, it’s crucial to seek out qualified medical experts for questions or concerns while following the recommendations from the CDC.
 If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, you should only follow the instructions given to you by medical examiners upon diagnosis — and breathing in hot air from your blow dryer is not one of them.COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic.

 The famed investor’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. spent the third quarter buying back about $9 billion of its own stock, more than it had repurchased in any full year in its history.
 The buying spree takes the total repurchases in the first nine months of 2020 to $16 billion, and the most recent pace would be the biggest of any U.S. company except Apple Inc., which happens to be Buffett’s largest investment.Buffett, 90, has been struggling for years to find attractive deals that would deploy his cash pile into higher-returning assets to help supercharge the growth of his conglomerate.
 In recent years, he’s backed off his long-held aversion to share buybacks.
 Now, repurchases led his capital-deployment maneuvers in the quarter, alongside a roughly $6 billion investment in Japanese trading houses, a bet on Snowflake Inc. and a deal for natural gas assets.“You start to talk about a pretty significant amount of cash that’s been put to work,” Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview.
 Big multi-billion investments “are difficult to come by and in the absence of that, they’re finding ways to put cash to work, I think in a meaningful amount.”The buybacks allowed Buffett to chip away at Berkshire’s cash pile in the third quarter, with that war chest dropping slightly to $145.7 billion, the company said Saturday.
 The funds, which still give him plenty of capital to deploy into acquisitions, stock purchases or buybacks, have recently been accumulating faster than Buffett can put them to work in higher-returning assets.The heightened buybacks could indicate more optimism in the conglomerate’s prospects, just months after Buffett told Berkshire shareholders at the annual meeting in May that repurchasing shares wasn’t more compelling than when the stock was much higher before the pandemic.Berkshire stock climbed 20% in the third quarter, surpassing the 8.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period.
 The company accelerated its repurchases even as the shares climbed through the quarter.
 Still, Berkshire stock is overall cheaper than it was at the end of last year, with Class A shares down 7.6% through Friday’s close.The buybacks likely continued into October.
 Saturday’s filing shows that Berkshire’s share count decreased even through Oct. 26, indicating Berkshire spent at least $2.3 billion repurchasing stock during those weeks.“The forceful share buybacks suggest that at least one lever that can be pulled more forcefully as the price lingers is the one that he’s doing,” Thomas Russo, who oversees more than $9 billion including Berkshire shares at Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner LLC, said in a phone interview.
 “I’m delighted to see that kind of commitment.”Operating ProfitThe conglomerate’s businesses have bounced back slightly from the depths of the slump in the second quarter.
 Profit at the railroad, while still down from a year earlier, was higher than the three months ended June 30, and Berkshire’s utilities posted its highest quarterly profit in more than a decade.
 Still, operating profit dropped 32%, hurt by the insurance unit’s first underwriting loss since the end of 2019.Buffett’s businessses have been battered by the pandemic this year.
 Aerospace parts-maker Precision Castparts, which was hit by a $10 billion charge in the second quarter, reported an 80% drop in pretax earnings in the three months that ended Sept. 30.
 Retailers such as See’s Candies and Oriental Trading have experienced “significant declines” in earnings this year.Berkshire’s board announced a policy change in July 2018 that allowed Buffett and his business partner, Charles Munger, to buy back stock when the price is below whatever they consider Berkshire’s intrinsic value.
 Previously, they couldn’t make repurchases if the price was more than 20% above current book value.“This concept of reallocating capital to shareholders was just not necessarily a tenet of Berkshire’s operating policies,” CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said in a phone interview.
 “In this environment, it’s getting harder and harder for them to justify holding on to billions and billions of dollars in Treasury securities.”Buffett’s appetite for equities wasn’t limited to his own shares.
 After selling the most stocks on a net basis in more than a decade during the second quarter, Berkshire reversed course in the following months, purchasing $4.79 billion of stocks on a net basis during the third quarter.The company’s investments delivered almost $25 billion in investment gains amid the market rally, helping net income almost double despite the drop in operating profit.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.1h agoInvestor's Business DailyWarren Buffett Doubles Down On Major Reversal In Investing StrategyWarren Buffett jumped back into the stock market again in Q3, after net selling in Q2, and spent a record amount buying back Berkshire Hathaway shares.3h agoU.S.News &amp; World Report7 Best Marijuana Stocks to BuyThe election results are bullish for marijuana stocks.

Morgan Weighs InBy a vote of one for, eight against, and two abstaining, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee concluded Friday that positive clinical data from Biogen's (BIIB) "EMERGE" trial, when "viewed independently and without regard for" data from the company's "ENGAGE" trial, were not sufficient to convince it that aducanumab is an effective treatment for Alzheimer's.The Advisory Committee furthermore voted zero to seven (with four abstentions) against a finding that Biogen's PRIME study data was any better.
 And although on the bright side, the committee voted five-to-zero-to-six sort of in favor of the verdict that Biogen has "presented strong evidence of a pharmacodynamic effect of aducanumab on Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology," in the end, they concluded by a crushing zero-to-10 margin (with one abstention) that it was not reasonable to rely upon the EMERGE data as a reason to approve the drug for commercial sale.That's the bad news.The good news is that the Advisory Committee's recommendations above are not binding on the FDA itself, and the FDA could, therefore, end up approving the drug anyway.
 (The FDA intends to render its own final verdict by March 7, 2021).But the other bad news is that, when you get right down to it, the Advisory Committee's conclusions were "overwhelmingly negative," as J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov opined in a note out today.
 Tallying up the results, points out Kasimov, Biogen garnered a grand total of just "one yet vote across the three key efficacy questions."
 And this, in the analyst's opinion, "certainly calls into serious question the FDA's very positive stance on aducanumab.
 "Calling the Advisory Committee's verdicts a "near unanimous vote against aducanumab and strong commentary against the FDA's own analyses," Kasimov warns that "with the FDA's reputation already in a precarious position, it could be difficult -- maybe impossible -- to go against an expert panel at this time no matter how badly they want this.
 "Which kind of makes the March 7 decision sound like a foregone conclusion, and not one that favors Biogen.So what does this mean for Biogen and the investors who've placed their faith in it?
 On the one hand, the aducanumab polls were unqualifiedly bad for Biogen.
 Still, they apparently weren't quite bad enough to shake JP Morgan's faith in the company so as to necessitate downgrading the stock from "neutral" (the stock's current rating) to "sell."
 Nor did Kasimov cut his price target on the stock from its present level of $269 per share.That being said, when you consider that Biogen stock costs nearly $329 a share today, Kasimov's $269 price target does still imply that Biogen stock is worth nearly 19% less than what investors are currently paying for it.
 (To watch Kasimov's track record, click here)This stock has attracted plenty of interest from Wall Street’s analysts.

 The summer saw big gains on Wall Street, perhaps a bubble, but definitely a bull market.
 September saw it slip off track, October has seen a partial recovery, while November started with a bang — or to be more precise, a boom.Some of Wall Street’s analysts see the remaining time for some smart stock plays in a volatile environment, and they are tagging their top picks to start the new year on a high note.
 Let's take a closer look.SVB Financial Group (SIVB)The first stock on the list is Silicon Valley’s largest deposit holding bank.
 SVB Financial Group is the holding company owning Silicon Valley Bank, a commercial bank specializing in high-tech venture capital.
 Since its founding in the 1980s, SVB has provided funding for more than 30,000 start-ups, and has also become a major financial services provider for Napa Valley’s vineyards.Working in the high-wealth areas of the San Francisco Bay region, and maintaining offices in other financial centers around the world – London, Hong Kong, and Toronto, among others – Silicon Valley Bank was well-positioned to weather the corona crisis.
 The bank’s revenue has been rising through 2020, from $807 million in Q1, to $860 million in Q2, to $1.08 billion in Q3.
 Earnings, after a sequential slip entering Q1, have also been on an upward track; the Q3 EPS came in at $8.47, beating the forecast by 55%.The bank’s shares have reflected the strong financial performance.
 SVB is up 27% year-to-date, having bounced back from the mid-winter market crash.Covering SIVB for Maxim, analyst Michael Diana writes, “SIVB remains our top bank pick due to: 1) its unique, non-replicable franchise; and 2) the growth implications of that franchise… The environment for VC-backed companies has improved, in our view, especially for the technology and life sciences companies that are SIVB's focus… we expect that SIVB's deposits, loan volumes, and investment/warrant gains should all benefit in 2021.”Diana rates SIVB as a Buy, and his $335 price target implies another 10% gain for the year ahead.
 (To watch Diana’s track record, click here)Overall, SVB Holdings has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 13 recent reviews, including 10 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell.
 (See SIVB stock analysis on TipRanks)Danaher Corporation (DHR)The second stock on the list is a conglomerate, a globally diversified company based in Washington, DC.
 Danaher works in the science and technology field, bringing together a range of companies through acquisitions and partnerships.
 Danaher operates three business segments, Life Sciences, Diagnostics, and Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions.Danaher has performed well through 2020, repeating its normal pattern of rising earnings from Q1 – but on steroids.
 The first quarter EPS was low, at $1.05, but quickly rose to $1.44 in Q2 and then $1.72 in Q3.
 The third quarter result was 25% higher than expectations.
 Revenues followed a similar path, gaining from $4.3 billion in Q1 to $5.9 billion in Q3.DHR shares have heavily outperformed the overall markets this year, rising nearly 60%.Doug Schenkel, 5-star analyst from Cowen, sees Danaher benefitting directly from the current pandemic situation and, as a result, moves the stock to a Top Pick.“We believe DHR has one of the best product portfolios among the Tools group to address the current COVID-19 challenges (bioprocessing, Dx).
 Over the next several quarters, a double-digit pro forma core revenue growth rate appears attainable, in part driven by these COVID-19 solutions.
 Looking beyond the current pandemic, we believe management commentary on the evolution of the business portfolio, strategy to extract durable revenue from near-term COVID-19 driven demand, and M&amp;A capacity (we estimate ~$15B+ over the next 12 months) should help build confidence that DHR is now plausibly built to generate sustainable HSD core revenue growth.
 This would be an impressive growth profile for a nearly ~$200B market cap Tools company and is well above current consensus estimates.” Schenkel opined.
 Schenkel, who is rated 56 of more than 7,000 analysts in the TipRanks database, rates DHR shares as an Outperform (i.e.
 Buy).
 His price target of $275 indicates an upside of 12% in the next 12 months.
 (To watch Schenkel’s track record, click here)Overall, Danaher boasts a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, and it is unanimous – the stock has received 6 Buys in recent weeks.
 (See DHR stock analysis on TipRanks)Boston Beer (SAM)The last stock on the list today is one you may be familiar with.
 Boston Beer is the owner of Sam Adams, the popular brew named after the Colonial-era patriot.
 Boston Beer is the fourth largest brewery in the US, boasted $1.33 billion in revenue for 2019.So far, 2020 has been a good year for Boston Beer.
 To put it bluntly, the social lockdown policies keeping people at home caused many of them to turn to beer for comfort, and Boston Beer has a well-liked flagship brand.
 The company’s earnings have risen steadily this year, from $1.32 in Q1 to $6.10 in Q3.
 At the top line, revenues have moved from $330 million in the first quarter, to $492 million in the third.Of the stocks on this list, Boston Beer has shown the strongest year-to-date share appreciation.
 The stock has almost tripled, gaining 183% despite all the vicissitudes of 2020.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer, who holds 5 stars with TipRanks, has reviewed the company's latest Q3 results and was duly impressed.
 As a result, Azer reiterated SAM as her Top Pick.“SAM handily beat our above-consensus est.
 for 3Q (historically their biggest EPS quarter, at 40% of 2019)… the company expects *all* of their brands to grow in 2021… Despite the reality of COVID uncertainty, select nuances inform the company's ahead-of-expectation outlook: 1) delayed shelf sets… 2) line of sight in terms of in-house and outsourced capacity and 3) an outlook for a doubling of hard seltzer,” Azer wrote.In line with her upbeat outlook, Azer rates the stock as a Buy along with a $1,250 price target.
 Her target suggests an upside of 17% over the coming year.
 (To watch Azer’s track record, click here)Overall, SAM shares get a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus on Wall Street.
 The stock has 9 recent reviews, breaking down to 6 Buys and 3 Holds.

 “We have the kitchen and chef, and we make real food.
 "When it comes to products, we have a full menu that will be chosen by customers.”1d agoBloombergThe Second Breakup of AT&amp;T(Bloomberg) -- AT&amp;T Inc. has been called many things over its 135-year history: Ma Bell, monopoly, media conglomerate.
 The company, which traces its roots to the patent rights of telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell, was the dominant phone company for much of the 20th century.
 So dominant, in fact, that it was broken up in 1982 as part of an agreement with antitrust authorities.
 But those businesses eventually began to merge, culminating with SBC Communications — one of the so-called Baby Bells — acquiring AT&amp;T in 2005 and taking the name.That wasn’t the end of it.
 What followed was a streak of deal-making that turned AT&amp;T into a new behemoth spanning television, media and advertising.
 After a failed attempt to acquire T-Mobile, the company bought satellite-TV provider DirecTV in 2015 for $49 billion, becoming the biggest provider of pay television.
 It purchased Time Warner in 2018 for $85 billion, making Ma Bell the improbable parent company of HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. and DC Comics.
 The carrier also made smaller deals, such as the 2018 acquisition of AppNexus, an online ad platform.And once again, AT&amp;T was too big.This time around, it isn’t the government pushing to slim down the company — though the Justice Department did unsuccessfully oppose the Time Warner deal — but its own investors and Chief Executive Officer John Stankey.Stankey took the helm in July, putting him in charge of a company with heavy debt and a media business that was ravaged by the pandemic.
 AT&amp;T also was shunted to No.
 3 in the wireless-phone business this year, following T-Mobile US Inc.’s acquisition of Sprint Corp.
 The company had just launched HBO Max, an attempt to take on Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. in streaming, but perhaps the most urgent matter was undoing some of the work of his predecessor.The last CEO, Randall Stephenson, had spent much of his 13-year tenure obsessed with deals.
 He kept a color-coded roster of potential companies he wanted AT&amp;T to buy, leading to 43 acquisitions.
 Now Stankey has his own to-do list: things he wants to sell.“It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Critics such as activist investor Elliott Management Corp. have urged AT&amp;T to focus on its subscriber services and walk back its go-big-or-go-home M&amp;A strategy by divesting acquisitions, including DirecTV.“When you look at what’s worked or hasn’t worked in telecom, you see that conglomerates and empire building has not been rewarded by the marketplace,” said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist with the Private Bank at Union Bank.Stankey, who has spent his entire 35-year career at AT&amp;T, may be an unlikely person to dismantle AT&amp;T’s acquisition empire.
 He rode shotgun as a top captain during Stephenson’s decade of agglomeration.
 The executive had a hand in creating some of the current problems and he calls them out directly: Last month, he acknowledged that pay-TV providers like DirecTV will probably face years of cord cutting before they hit bottom.Now, more than 100 days into the job, he says his plan of attack is to focus on three key growth areas: wireless — particularly 5G — where there’s hope for new consumer and business applications; fiber-optic network connections to accommodate surging data traffic; and HBO Max, the online streaming future of AT&amp;T’s video ambitions.As for new acquisitions, don’t expect much beyond opportunistic purchases, Stankey said in an interview in September.
 “Right now this management team is focused on getting execution right and moving the distractions elsewhere,” he said.
 “It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”Last month, AT&amp;T got $1.1 billion for its stake in Central European Media Enterprises.
 The company has already sold office buildings and a stake in Disney’s streaming service Hulu.
 It also got nearly $2 billion from the sale of its Puerto Rico phone business earlier this month.The company is aiming to pay down debt and cut $6 billion in annual costs, partly through slashing thousands of jobs.But AT&amp;T still has plenty of potential businesses to sell or scale back.
 The question now is how big an asset sale it wants to have — and who may be interested in buying.DirecTVThe biggest priority is DirecTV and AT&amp;T’s other pay-TV operations, which have been hemorrhaging customers.
 AT&amp;T has been exploring options for DirecTV for more than a year, but finding a buyer for the whole business seems unlikely.A combination with Dish Network Corp., the nation’s other satellite-TV provider, is one scenario.
 But reducing the industry to a single player would draw antitrust scrutiny, especially since rural customers have few other options.
 A proposed combination of the two businesses was shot down by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department in 2002.Instead, AT&amp;T is trying to sell a stake — and possibly control of the business — to outside investors.
 a move that could take some of the drag off AT&amp;T’s performance.
 But the ice cube is melting fast: Pay-TV revenue fell by more than $1 billion, or 10%, in the third quarter.Apollo Global Management Inc. has been in discussions about such a transaction.
 And Bloomberg News reported this week that former Citigroup Inc. rainmaker Michael Klein could do a deal through his blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp. IV.
 Ideally, an agreement would let AT&amp;T remove DirecTV from its books while maintaining access to some of its cash flow.But a deal is expected to value DirecTV at only about $15 billion when final bids are accepted next month.
 That's less than a third of the price AT&amp;T paid five years ago.VrioAT&amp;T’s DirecTV Latin America business suffers some of the same problems as the U.S. operations, only with an even more erratic political backdrop.
 The 2015 acquisition of DirecTV included satellite businesses in South America and the Caribbean — an entity that was renamed Vrio.
 The unit’s biggest problem was its Venezuela pay-TV business.
 During the country’s political turmoil, the service was shut down after getting caught between U.S. restrictions and the local government.AT&amp;T tried but failed to spin off part of Vrio in an initial public offering.
 Then, after reducing the size and price of the offer, AT&amp;T abandoned the move.
 For the past two years, the falling value of the satellite-TV business has made prospects of unloading the business even dimmer.Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentUnlike some of its businesses, AT&amp;T’s video-game division would be a prized asset for a number of potential buyers.
 The company has reportedly explored a sale of the operations, which are estimated to be worth $4 billion.
 But AT&amp;T recently pulled the business off a list of noncore assets that it's willing to part with.The unit, whose video games include titles like Harry Potter: Wizards Unite and Mortal Kombat 11, attracted interest from several major companies.
 But with the gaming industry booming during the pandemic — and AT&amp;T facing the complications of wanting to retain licensing rights — the company may have decided the division was worth keeping for itself.CrunchyrollThe animation video service was the first step in AT&amp;T’s massive pivot to media six years ago.
 Crunchyroll was acquired through the company’s newly formed joint venture with the Chernin Group, called Otter Media.
 The name is derived from the abbreviation OTT, for content delivered via the internet “over the top” of a traditional platform.
 Since then, just “streaming” has become the more popular term.AT&amp;T bought out the remaining stake in Otter Media from the Chernin Group in 2018.
 More recently, the telecom giant has had second thoughts.
 Last week, the Nikkei business daily reported that Sony Corp. was in final talks to acquire the service in a deal worth close to $1 billion.CNNCNN is one of the more controversial businesses that AT&amp;T acquired when it absorbed WarnerMedia in 2018, with the president regularly assailing the cable-news network on social media.
 It's also been the source of takeover speculation, with Jeff Bezos seen as a potential buyer.
 But Stankey said in September that CNN was one of the pieces of the WarnerMedia structure that are “more tightly wound together than they were before.” In other words, selling it would seem less likely.
 XandrAT&amp;T had high hopes for the AppNexus digital advertising unit it acquired for $1.6 billion in 2018.
 Named in a nod to Alexander Graham Bell, Xandr was going to be an advertising network that all pay-TV providers could use.
 Ad-industry veteran Brian Lesser was hired to run the operation, and Stephenson told investors that the business would bring in $2 billion in new revenue by using customer data to deliver targeted ads.Those fortunes didn’t materialize.
 Lesser left, and now it’s up for sale as new WarnerMedia chief Jason Kilar brings in another ad team.Regional Sports NetworksAT&amp;T has four regional sports networks, or RSNs, which include rights to teams such as hockey’s Pittsburgh Penguins, basketball’s Houston Rockets and baseball’s Seattle Mariners.Though live sports are still the closest thing to must-see TV these days, owning RSNs has increasingly become a headache.
 Sports leagues have sought ever-increasing sums for rights to their games, and subscribers aren’t as reliable as they once were.
 Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. just wrote down its RSNs by $4.23 billion, an admission that it overpaid for the cable channels, which it only acquired last year.Looking for cash to pay down debts, AT&amp;T had hoped to sell its RSNs and cash in on their $1 billion in estimated value.
 The company sought bids last year, but a buyer didn’t materialize.
 This year, with sports still trying to bounce back from Covid-19, a sale seems even less likely.Digital LifeIn a bold attempt to take on home-security giant ADT Inc., AT&amp;T launched its own “smart home” security and monitoring venture in 2013.
 While the effort was intended to explore opportunities beyond its wireless service, the timing and model may have been wrong.
 Homeowners were already moving away from expensive security services and buying do-it-yourself systems or products like Ring from Amazon.com Inc. or Nest from Alphabet Inc. Four years into the venture, AT&amp;T started looking for ways to get out.AT&amp;T MexicoStephenson crossed borders and ended a decadeslong friendship with his onetime mentor Carlos Slim by becoming a direct competitor for mobile customers in Mexico.
 AT&amp;T bought wireless carrier Grupo Iusacell SA for $2.5 billion in 2015 and expanded the service to cover most of Mexico by 2018.
 But Covid-19, foreign-exchange rates and the dominance of rival America Movil in Mexico has kept the investment unprofitable and difficult to justify.“It’s going to keep us busy for a little bit of time.”So what does Stankey do now?
 Holding out to get top dollar for some of these assets might not be the right approach, said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen.Stankey just needs to “rip the Band-Aid off and move on,” Synesael said.
 In other words, take what he can get.
 “I think it has become obvious to him that he needs to do it.
 And the sooner he does it the better,” Synesael said.
 “He doesn’t want to spend his entire CEO tenure undoing what he and Randall did in the past.
 Get it done now so he can concentrate on other initiatives.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.1d agoU.S.News &amp; World Report10 Best-Performing 401(k) FundsThe 401(k) might be the best wealth-building tool for retirement ever created.

 That’s down from about 9% on Oct. 28.Palantir has now gained about 32% since the U.S. election was held on Nov. 3, adding more than $5 billion in market value.
 The company is scheduled to report financial results for the first time as a publicly traded company on Nov.
 12.
