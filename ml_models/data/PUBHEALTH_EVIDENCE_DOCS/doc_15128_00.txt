s Hospitals
 
 
 
As our leaders debate and maneuver over the issue of expanding Medicaid
 
it is important 
to look at the financial health of the hospitals in our s
tate since the hospitals
 
are the largest 
single 
promoter of this proposed
 
policy change.
  
It is t
he hospitals that
 
are 
among the 
large
st
 
employers 
in our state. 
Thus they carry influence
 
with 
many legislators and 
the local Chambers of 
Commerce and other business groups. 
 
 
And hospitals are our refuge from fear when we are faced with a health crisis.
  
If
 
our 
hospitals generally
 
a
re faced wi
th financial difficulties should 
Med
icaid
 
not 
be 
expanded 

 
as is
 
often said in this debate 

 
then 
we 
should
 
be concerned
.
 
The financial health of the hospitals has become an issue because the hospitals have 
weighed
 
in on the Medicaid expansion debate saying th
ey need these federal dollars.
 
A
s our elected officials debate whether to expand Medicaid to 400,000 more Virginians, 
it is only reasonable to see if one of the biggest advocates for this policy change 

 
the ho
spitals 

 
are really in financial need. 
 
This report looks 
at the actual financial health of our hospitals as reported on the Virginia 
Hospital Information website (http://www.vhi.org/hospital_region.asp) for November of 2013. 
 
The reader can decide for hi
mself or herself if the hospital
s
 

offered by the proposed expansion of Medicaid by looking at the numbers in this report.
 
This report shows the total profit/loss for all reporting hospitals in the state and their total 
net wor
th.  As you can see, the numbers reported in November 2013 show that statewide, all 
hospitals had a 
combined 
profit of $1,583,783,697 

 

the combined
 
net worth of these reporting hospitals was $14,772,991,585 

 

billion in net worth.
 
As I understand the h

 
who walk into the Emergency Rooms and 
receive treatment but 
do not have health insurance,
 
are not on Medica
id
 
or are unable to pay
 
are 
a total financ
ial loss to the hospitals.  The hospitals receive no payments
 
get no
 
government
 
re
imbursements.  If Medicaid is
 
expanded, the hospitals would get some reimbursement from 
that program which is paid for by all the ta
xpayers.
 
 
T


 
is clear
ly a loss to the hospitals. 
T
hey would like to get some money for these medical treatments and
 
they
 
see the expansi
on of 
Medicaid as a way to do it
.  However, the 
real question is 
whether these losses
 
in provid
ing 
medical treatment for those unable to pay
 
have significantly hurt the
 

 
Clearly, most
 
hospitals are
 
not
 
in financial dif
ficulty but some
 
do
 
seem to be in financial 
strife
, particularly in the south
western part of our state.
  
S
ome have a great deal of money
.
  
A 
number of hospitals that show a loss in their reporting last year to the Virginia Hospital 
Information website have significant net worth
 
so t
hey seem
 
to be financially sound
.  
 
 
 When you look at these numbers, you will see that most of the Acute Care Hospitals in 
our state are doing quite well.  
Acute C

 
where most 
people go when required to do so.  These are the hospitals 
with which we are 
most familiar
.
 
These are the hospitals where most people go to the Emergency Rooms when needed.
  
These are 
the hospitals
 
where most people go for an operation.  These are the ones
 
that
 
we are most 
concerned about if they face financial troubles.
 
T
his study
 
carves
 
out
 
these
 
Acute Care H
ospitals from
 
the total
 
list of hospitals and sets 
them apart
.  And the Non
-
Acute Hospitals
 
are listed separately
 
as well
.  These
 
tend to be the 
specialty hospitals that are smaller
 
and more specialized
.  
A
s a whole
, these als
o
 
seem to be 
doing quite we
ll as the numbers recorded
 
on
 
the Virginia Hospital Info
rmation website
 
show.
 
When hospitals are making tens of millions of dollar
s
 
in profit and have hundreds of 
millions of dollars, and in some cases billions of dollars, of net worth, our taxpayers need to ask 
a simple question:  Do these hospitals really face a financial crisis to such a degree as they need 
to have Medicaid, a nati
onal entitlement program fraught with its own problems, expanded and 
thus put our state and nation in a more difficult financial position?
 
There is a difference between needing money and liking to have
 
more
 
money.  It seems 
to this author that there is pot
ential money on the table for the hospitals if Medicaid is expanded. 
Instead of absorbing
 
the costs of Emergency Room care
 
for those who are unable to pay or who 
are not on Medicaid
, hospitals want to
 
be reimbursed 
for 
some of that 
expense 
through an 
expan
ded Medicaid program.  
These hospitals
,
 
in most cases
,
 

 
seem to
 

,
 
but since it is potentially available
 
they wo

adding additional funds to their profit line. 
 
This report is provide
d to assist our policy makers and those who influence our policy 
makers to make a more informed decision.  The policy comments are mine and do not 
necessarily reflect those of our individual Board Members.  This report will hopefully provide 
our lawmakers 
and others with additional information in this Medicaid expansion debate.  
Nothing in this report is meant to influence the outcome of any specific legislation.

About these numbers:
  
all are taken from the website for Virginia Hospital Information: 
http://www.vhi.org/hospital_region.asp
 
All listed hospitals are non
-
profit unless designated private.  Hospitals that could be 

Hospitals and Non
-
Acute Hospitals.
  
The combined numbers for all hospitals
 
in a region
, acute
 
care
 
and non
-
acute
 
care, are listed.  Hospitals that
 
belong to a network of affiliated hospitals 
are listed at the end of each regional listing so that the reader can see how the overall hospital 
group is doing financially
 
in that region

 
acute and non
-
acute hospitals combined
.  
The 
statewide totals for these affiliated hospitals are listed after the combined regional numbers.  
As with many companies and organizations, one affilia
te might be doing 
less well than
 
others, 
but the overall financial strength of the operation can be seen by combining affiliates.  The 
statewide combined numbers 
and the combined regional numbers are listed
 
for the reader to 
revi
ew
.  Following the first two
