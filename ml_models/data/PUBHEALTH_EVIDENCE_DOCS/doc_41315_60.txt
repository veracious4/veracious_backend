your 
body fights disease (immunosuppression).
 
 
 
If any of the above apply to you
 
Havrix Monodose can still be given, but you may not 
develop enough antibod

se cases, the doctor or nurse may decide that extra doses of Havrix Monodose should 
be given and may take a blood test to measure
 
the antibody levels in the blood before or 
after the vaccine is given. 
 
 
Sometimes, an injection of antibody will be need
e
d
 
to
 
try to protect
 
you u
ntil the vaccine 
starts to work. This can be given at the same time as 
t
he vaccine but will be injected into the 
opposite arm.

General
 
information on hepat
i
t
is A
 
 
Hepatitis A virus causes an infection of the liver. You can catch the virus by eating or 
drinking contaminated foo
d or
 
w
ate
r. The virus
 
is p
resent in the
 
bowel movement (motion
)
 
of
 
infected people, even when they may have no signs of the infection.
 
Y
ou can catch hepatitis 
A infection in any country but the risk is highest in places and countries where sanitation and 
f
ood 
a
n
d w
ater hygiene
 
are 
poor.
 
 
After 
catching the virus, it can be up to 
6
 
weeks before signs of illness are seen. Some 
people have 
t
h
e virus and never get ill but they can still infect other people during this time.
 
The main signs of the illness include
 
sic
k
n
ess
,
 
yellowing 
of th
e skin and ey
es (
jaundice
)
, 
fever 
and headache
. These signs are all due to an inflammation of the liver whil
e
 
it is 
infected with the virus.
 
 
Most patients get better
,
 
usually after a couple of 
weeks or 
months, but a few people ma
y 
ta
k
e
 
up
 
to a year t
o mak
e a full reco
very. While recovering, people affected with hepatitis A 
may be unable to work
. They
 
may not be
 
a
ble to drink alcohol and may need to avoid certain 

ry r
a
r
e b
ut sometimes
 
the 
liver stops w
orking 
and hospital
 
care is needed until the infection gets better.
 
 
There are many other types
 
o
f virus that can cause hepatitis. The signs may be the same as 
in hepatitis A infection but the viruses are not always c
augh
t
 
thr
ough food an
d dri
nk.
