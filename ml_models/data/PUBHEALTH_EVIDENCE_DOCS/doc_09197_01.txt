 The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS), defined as survival without death or disease activity from any one of: disability progression, relapse, or new lesions on MRI.
 Participants were evaluated through 5 years posttransplant.
 Toxicities were reported using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (AE).Results: Twenty-five participants were evaluated for transplant and 24 participants underwent HDIT/HCT.
 Median follow-up was 62 months (range 12–72).
 EFS was 69.2% (90% confidence interval [CI] 50.2–82.1).
 Progression-free survival, clinical relapse-free survival, and MRI activity-free survival were 91.3% (90% CI 74.7%–97.2%), 86.9% (90% CI 69.5%–94.7%), and 86.3% (90% CI 68.1%–94.5%), respectively.
 AE due to HDIT/HCT were consistent with expected toxicities and there were no significant late neurologic adverse effects noted.
