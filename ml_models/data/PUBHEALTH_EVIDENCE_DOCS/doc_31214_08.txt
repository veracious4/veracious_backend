 “A Mass burial site of many dozens of black men, who had been subjected to brutal torture and [then] murdered, has been found,”  Cartwright said.
 “In many cases, body parts are missing; most victims had been shot in the head.”  Cartright said that the mass grave was uncovered when the current owner of the property was making extensive renovations to the house and needed to dig up the foundations.
 “The current occupier was excavating the southern end of the property when he came across some leg bones,” Said Cartwright.
 “He notified local law enforcement who then called in the FBI once they realized the extent of the number of victims.” Authorities state it’s still very early in the recovery and identification process, but they estimate the grave to be at least 50 years old and contain upwards of 10 bodies.

 However, Mississippi records list Eldon Lee Edwards a U.S. Ku Klux Klan leader as owning the property from 1945-1953.
 Eldon Lee Edwards died in 1960.
 He was charged with involvement in the abduction, torture and murder of three black men in 1944, but he was never convicted.
