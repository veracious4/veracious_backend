 Populations of the iconic monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) of eastern North America have declined over the last 21 years.
 Three hypotheses have been posed to explain the decline: habitat loss on the overwintering grounds in Mexico, habitat loss on the breeding grounds in the United States and Canada, and extreme weather events.
 Our objectives were to assess population viability, determine which life stage, season and geographical region are contributing the most to population dynamics and test the three hypotheses that explain the observed population decline.
 We developed a spatially structured, stochastic and density‐dependent periodic projection matrix model that integrates patterns of migratory connectivity and demographic vital rates across the annual cycle.
 We used perturbation analysis to determine the sensitivity of population abundance to changes in vital rate among life stages, seasons and geographical regions.
 Next, we compared the singular effects of each threat to the full model where all factors operate concurrently.
 Finally, we generated predictions to assess the risk of host plant loss as a result of genetically modified crops on current and future monarch butterfly population size and extinction probability.
 Our year‐round population model predicted population declines of 14% and a quasi‐extinction probability ( 5% within a century.
 Monarch abundance was more than four times more sensitive to perturbations of vital rates on the breeding grounds than on the wintering grounds.
 Simulations that considered only forest loss or climate change in Mexico predicted higher population sizes compared to milkweed declines on the breeding grounds.
 Our model predictions also suggest that mitigating the negative effects of genetically modified crops results in higher population size and lower extinction risk.
 Recent population declines stem from reduction in milkweed host plants in the United States that arise from increasing adoption of genetically modified crops and land‐use change, not from climate change or degradation of forest habitats in Mexico.
 Therefore, reducing the negative effects of host plant loss on the breeding grounds is the top conservation priority to slow or halt future population declines of monarch butterflies in North America.
 Introduction Hemispheric migrations of wildlife involving billions of individuals each year are in widespread decline (Robbins et al.
 1989; Bolger et al.
 2008; Brower et al.
 2012).
 Migratory animals face multiple threats at different portions of the annual cycle that are often separated by vast geographical distances (Webster et al.
 2002), which pose enormous challenges for predicting population abundance and designing effective management plans (Martin et al.
 2007; Norris &amp; Marra 2007; Small‐Lorenz et al.
 2013).
 Addressing threats to population viability of migratory animals therefore requires integrating detailed information of how individuals move, survive and reproduce throughout the annual cycle and respond to these threats (Webster et al.
 2002; Norris &amp; Marra 2007; Taylor &amp; Norris 2010; Jenouvrier 2013).
 Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), which undergo a long‐distance migration between breeding and non‐breeding locations typical of vertebrates, have traditionally been considered most vulnerable to disturbance on the overwintering grounds.
 In Mexico, forest habitat loss (Brower et al.
 2002) and severe weather patterns (Oberhauser &amp; Peterson 2003; Brower et al.
 2004) are known to affect local butterfly population abundance by increasing the probability of catastrophic mass mortality events (Anderson &amp; Brower 1996; Brower et al.
 2012).
 Alternatively, declines of monarch butterflies may also be attributed to habitat loss that could occur at multiple locations and time periods of the breeding cycle.
 2001; Brower et al.
 2012; Pleasants &amp; Oberhauser 2013) is predicted to increase competition for food among larvae leading to decreases in immature survival (Flockhart, Martin &amp; Norris 2012).
 Given that the conservation of monarch butterflies, like many migratory species, is a responsibility shared by multiple countries (Commission for Environmental Cooperation 2008), a quantitative assessment of year‐round population dynamics is critical for guiding effective transboundary conservation planning and assessing risk of extinction in the wild.
 Our objectives were to (i) assess the long‐term viability trend and cumulative quasi‐extinction probability ( 10 mm would result in butterflies being wetted and making them more vulnerable to freezing risk (Anderson &amp; Brower 1996) and assumed that the probability of a rain event of &gt;10 mm between December and March summarized from the weather station data would remain consistent.
 The matrix population model randomly selected a daily probability of a large rain event and a minimum temperature to calculate the daily survival between December 1 and March 30.
 The product of these daily mortality estimates represented the population‐level stochastic mortality rate of each year of the model (see Supporting Information).
 Analysis We initiated the population model using the population size observed in 1994 (Rendón‐Salinas &amp; Tavera‐Alonso 2014) to assess the model fit from the first 19 years of the simulation (1995–2013) and then projected the population for 100 years and calculated the stochastic population growth rate (log λs) and 95% confidence interval from 1000 simulations.
 Model fit was assessed by testing the standard deviates of the population growth rates from observed and projected population sizes (McCarthy et al.
 2001).
 The cumulative probability of quasi‐extinction was determined using a binomial model that regress the counts of the number of simulations that had gone extinct by a given year.
 To test between the three hypotheses, we divided the mean population size from a simulation with each effect by the population size of the full model and used linear models to regress differences in population size against year.
 A slope different from zero indicates that threat alone would cause a larger (in the case of positive slope) future population than the full model that considers all threats simultaneously.
 To understand the factors that limit population size of monarch butterflies, we estimated monthly transient elasticities (the relative sensitivity values which sum to 1) of the total species abundance to perturbation of the migration and demographic vital rates (Caswell 2007).
 To make general predictions of the sensitivity of population growth to changes in vital rates throughout the annual cycle, we summed the demographic transition elasticity values across life stages (immature, adult), life‐history events (breeding, non‐breeding) or regions (Mexico, South, Central, North).
 We ran all simulations using Matlab R2009.
 3a) and predict that, if land‐use and climate change continue as expected, population size will decline by an additional 14% within the next 100 years (Fig.
 3b).
 Furthermore, under these conditions, we predict that the cumulative probability of quasi‐extinction of 5% (Fig.
 3b).
 Overall, the stochastic population growth rate was predicted to be −0·0332 (95% CI: [−0·4028, 0·3364]) (Fig.
 2012; Rendón‐Salinas &amp; Tavera‐Alonso 2014).
 Figure 3Open in figure viewerPowerPoint  Monarch butterfly population size is projected to decrease with a corresponding increase in quasi‐extinction probability.
 (a) The model‐derived mean predicted overwintering colony size (points) fit the observed monarch butterfly overwintering colony size (bars; Brower et al.
 2012; Rendón‐Salinas &amp; Tavera‐Alonso 2014).
 Overwintering population size is the area (in hectares) occupied by clustering monarch butterflies.
 For predicted colony size, the points represent the mean density (50 million ha−1), while the upper (25 million ha−1) and lower (75 million ha−1) error bars represent the observed lower and upper population density estimate (Brower et al.
 2004) assuming a 1 : 1 sex ratio.
