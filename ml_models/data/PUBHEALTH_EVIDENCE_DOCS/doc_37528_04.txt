 One of the men depicted bore a striking resemblance to Channing Tatum:An equally popular version of the rumor was shared to Twitter:Spain is deploying its army to help manage their coronavirus outbreak and not to be insensitive at an anxiety-inducing time but uh… I think I speak for all New Yorkers when I say, Spain, hi, can you deploy some of that in our direction?
