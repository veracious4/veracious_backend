 Most fatalities in the 1918 influenza outbreak were due to subsequent bacterial infection, particularly with Streptococcus pneumoniae.1Morens DM Taubenberger JK Fauci AS Predominant role of bacterial pneumonia as a cause of death in pandemic influenza: implications for pandemic influenza preparedness.J Infect Dis.

 2020; 395: 507-513Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3990) Google Scholar have recorded both bacterial and fungal co-infections.
 Although 71% of the admitted patients with COVID-19 received antibiotic drugs, no information is available on the antimicrobial sensitivities of the organisms that were identified, or on the type and duration of antimicrobial treatment.
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease and many patients with COPD will have underlying chronic bacterial infections before severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but this important information is not being reported.
 More data on co-infections are urgently required to establish their importance in COVID-19 severity and mortality.Diagnosing co-infections is complex.
 The organism itself might be carried by the patient before the viral infection, might be part of an underlying chronic infection, or might be picked up nosocomially.
 In the UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) treatment guidance for severe acquired pneumonia is broad-spectrum antibiotic co-amoxiclav plus a macrolide to cover atypical organisms.
 Currently, antibiotic use is high (74·5%) among patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to intensive care units, rendering culture-based microbiological testing less sensitive.
 Patients with COVID-19 are kept on invasive mechanical ventilation for a long time (mean 9·1 days [SD 5·5]), increasing chances of hospital and ventilator acquired infections.
 Hence, early diagnosis of co-infection is required, preferably using methods capable of detecting a broad range of potential pathogens and antimicrobial resistances, with subsequent monitoring for infection development.
 To accurately diagnose and study co-infection in COVID-19, patients should be recruited on admission to intensive care units and sampled longitudinally throughout the disease course using culture-independent techniques capable of identifying complex mixed infections without previous target selection, such as whole-genome metagenomics.5Charalampous T Kay GL Richardson H et al.Nanopore metagenomics enables rapid clinical diagnosis of bacterial lower respiratory infection.Nat Biotechnol.
 2019; 37: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar Such a study would provide valuable surveillance data on the pathogens causing co-infections and antimicrobial resistance in the intensive care setting, thereby helping inform antibiotic prescribing policy.Rapid characterisation of co-infection is essential in the management and treatment of the most severe COVID-19 cases, could help to save lives, and will improve antimicrobial stewardship throughout the course of the pandemic.DB has received research grants from MedImmune, outside of the submitted work.
