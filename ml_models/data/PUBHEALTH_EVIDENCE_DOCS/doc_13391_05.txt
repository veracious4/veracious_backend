Members
 
are
 
encouraged
 
to
 
seek
 
advice
 
from
 
the
 
Office
 
of
 
Legislative
 
Legal
 
Services
 
if
 
questions
 
arise
 
concerning
 
the
 
application
 
of
 
Article
 
XXIX,
 
and
 
its
 
exceptions,
 
to
 
specific
 
factual
 
circumstances.
 
Article
 
XXIX
 
also
 
expressly
 
prohibits
 
a
 
professional
 
lobbyist,
 
personally
 
or
 
on
 
behalf
 
of
 
any
 
other
 
person
 
or
 
entity,

accept
 
anything,
 
including
 
a

Another
 
noteworthy
 
provision
 
of
 
Article
 
XXIX
 
imposes
 
a
 
"revolving
 
door"
 
ban
 
that
 
prohibits
 
former

of
 
the
 
General
 
Assembly
 
from
 
personally
 
representing
 
another
 
person
 
or
 
entity
 
for
 
compensation
 
before
 
any
 
other
 
statewide

or
 
member
 
of
 
the

a
 
two

year
 
period
 
following
 
the
 
former

departure
 
from
 
office.
 
Article
 
XXIX
 
establishes
 
an
 
independent
 
ethics
 
commission
 
to
 
enforce
 
these
 
ethics
 
provisions,
 
other
 
standards
 
of
 
conduct,
 
and
 
any
 
reporting
 
requirements.
 
Members
 
may
 
also
 
seek
 
advisory
 
opinions
 
from
 
the
 
commission.
 
The
 
commission
 
has
 
issued
 
several
 
position
 
statements,
 
advisory
 
opinions,
 
and
 
letter
 
rulings
 
addressing
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
common
 
questions
 
that
 
have
 
arisen
 
since
 
the
 
passage
 
of
 
Article
 
XXIX,
 
including
 
the
 
acceptance
 
of
 
gifts,
 
travel
 
expenses,
 
and
 
special
 
discounts.

Bribery and Solicitation of Bribery (Vote
 
Trading).
  
Article V, section 40 of the 
Colorado Constitution prohibits
 
bribery
, which is how the constitution refers to vote 
trading.  A legislator who actually gives his or her vote or influence in favor of or 
against a measure in exchange for an agreeme
nt by another legislator to give his or her 
vote or influence in favor of or against a different measure has committed 
bribery
.  An 
offer or promise to do the same made by both members

which objective is 
presumably not achieved

constitutes 
solicitation of 
bribery
.  Any member or person 
elected to the General Assembly who is found guilty of either offense must be 
expelled.  It is not a violation of this constitutional provision for one or more 
legislators to make an agreement with individuals who are not leg
is
l
ators (such as 
lobbyists) to support or oppose different 
measures.

Statutory
 
Code
 
of
 
Ethics
 
Article
 
18
 
of
 
title
 
24,
 
C.R.S.,
 
prescribes
 
standards
 
of
 
conduct
 
for
 
government
 
officials
 
and
 
employees.
 
Part
 
1
 
establishes
 
a
 
"Code
 
of
 
Ethics",
 
and
 
part
 
2
 
describes
 
prohibited
 
acts
 
relating
 
to
 
contracts
 
and
 
claims.
 
Rules
 
of
 
conduct
 
versus
 
ethical
 
principles.
 
The
 
code
 
of
 
ethics
 
provides
 
that
 
the
 
holding
 
of
 
public
 
office
 
is
 
a
 
public
 
trust,
 
and
 
a
 
member
 
of
 
the
 
General
 
Assembly
 
or
 
other
 
public
 
official
 
"whose
 
conduct
 
departs
 
from
 
his
 
fiduciary
 
duty
 
is
 
liable
 
to
 
the
 
people
 
of
 
the
 
state
 
as
 
a
 
trustee
 
of
 
property
 
and
 
shall
 
suffer
 
such
 
other
 
liabilities
 
as
 
a
 
private
 
fiduciary
 
would
 
suffer
 
for
 
abuse
 
of
 
his
 
trust".
3
 
The
 
code
 
further
 
enumerates
 
specified
 
"
rules
 
of
 
conduct
"
 
applicable
 
to
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
General
 
Assembly
 
and
 
provides
 
that
 
"proof
 
beyond
 
a
 
reasonable
 
doubt
 
of
 
commission
 
of
 
any
 
act
 
enumerated"
 
is
 
proof
 
that
 
the
 
actor
 
"has
 
breached
 
his
 
fiduciary
 
duty
 
and
 
the
 
public
 
trust".
4
 
Under
 
these
 
rules,
 
a
 
member
 
of
 
the
 
General
 
Assembly
 
may
 
not:
 

 
Disclose
 
or
 
use
 
confidential
 
information
 
acquired
 
in
 
the
 
course
 
of
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
official
 
duties
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
further
 
substantially
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
financial
 
interests.
 

 
Accept
 
a
 
gift
 
of
 
substantial
 
value
 
or
 
a
 
substantial
 
economic
 
benefit
 
tantamount
 
to
 
a
 
gift
 
of
 
substantial
 
value
 
which:
 
1)
 
Would
 
tend
 
to
 
improperly

The
 
code
 
also
 
establishes
 
"ethical
 
principles"
 
applicable
 
to
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
General
 
Assembly
 
and
 
provides
 
that
 
ethical
 
principles
 
serve
 
only
 
as
 
"guides"
 
to
 
conduct
 
and
 
do
 
not
 
constitute
 
v
iolations
 
of
 
the
 
public
 
trust.
6
 
Under
 
the
 
ethical
 
principles,
 
a
 
member
 
of
 
the
 
General
 
Assembly
 
who
 
has
 
a
 
personal
 
or
 
private
 
interest
 
in
 
any
 
measure
 
or
 
bill
 
proposed
 
or
 
pending
 
before
 
the
 
General
 
Assembly
 
must
 
disclose
 
that
 
fact
 
and
 
not
 
vote
 
on
 
the
 
bill
 
or
 
measure.
7
 
In
 
deciding
 
whether
 
he
 
or
 
she
 
has
 
a
 
personal
 
or
 
private
 
interest
 
in
 
a
 
measure
 
or
 
bill,
 
the
 
code
 
of
 
ethics
 
directs
 
the
 
member
 
to
 
consider
: 1) W
hether
 
t
he
 
interest
 
impedes
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
independence
 
of
 
judgment
; 2)
 
the
 
effect
 
of
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
participation
 
on
 
public
 
confidence
 
in
 
the
 
integrity
 
of
 
the
 
General
 
Assembly
; 
and
 
3)
 
whether
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
participation
 
is
 
likely
 
to
 
have
 
any
 
significant
 
effect
 
on
 
the
 
disposition
 
of
 
the
 
matter.
8
 
Voluntary
 
disclosure.
 
The
 
code
 
provides
 
that
 
a
 
member
 
of
 
the
 
General
 
Assembly
 
"may,
 
prior
 
to
 
acting
 
in
 
a
 
manner
 
which
 
may
 
impinge
 
on
 
his
 
fiduciary
 
duty
 
and
 
the
 
public
 
trust,
 
disclose
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
his
 
private
 
interest"
 
in
 
the
 
manner
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
rules
 
of
 
the
 
House
 
of
 
Representatives
 
and
 
the
 
Senate.
 
Disclosure
 
then
 
serves
 
as
 
"an
 
affirmative
 
defense
 
to
 
any
 
civil
 
or
 
criminal
 
action
 
or
 
any
 
other
 
sanction".
9
 
We
 
are
 
not
 
aware
 
of
 
a
 
case
 
in
 
which
 
this
 
affirmative
 
defense
 
has
 
been
 
tested.
 
While
 
disclosure
 
may
 
provide
 
a
 
measure
 
of
 
protection
 
when
 
the
 
issue
 
is
 
close,
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
certain
 
that
 
mere
 
disclosure
 
would
 
insulate
 
a
 
member
 
from
 
liability
 
when
 
the
 
conduct
 
is
 
clearly
 
a
 
breach
 
of
 
the
 
member's
 
fiduciary
 
duty
 
and
 
the
 
public
 
trust.
 
Furthermore,
 
where
 
civil
 
or
 
criminal
 
liability
 
is
 
predicated
 
on
 
a
 
constitutionally
 
imposed
 
duty,
 
it
 
is
 
questionable
 
whether
 
a
 
statute
 
could
 
grant
 
an
 
affirmative
 
defense.
