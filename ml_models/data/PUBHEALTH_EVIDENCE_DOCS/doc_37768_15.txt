 From a young age, I would constantly look in weird places like a shower head, air vent, etc., always convinced I was under some kind of surveillance.

 BTW, what time is it?
 I'm too drunk to read the clock.
 Maybe it's time...let's go VD!!
 Gave me a good chuckle.
 We all know anyone can take on these traits, some people are too sensitive in this thread.
 I‚Äôm an accidental cancer though cause I was born two weeks late...and I am a bisexual cheap ass bitch so now I‚Äôm just confused.
 I‚Äôm such a stereotype.
 so thank you.
 My intuition tells me that either a Scorpio or an Aries wrote this.
 The highlights for me are Leo, Libra, Virgo.
 I'm a Taurus sun.
 The description called me a commi.
 I'm light-heartedly fine with that.
 Do we have fascists in here?
 Wtf.
 Taurus are usually said to be lazy and love luxury.
 Nixon was Capricorn.
 The rest is hilarious.
 Excellent.
 Let‚Äôs look at Capricorn.‚Äù And I got sad.
 Wouldn‚Äôt pay much attention to it tho, rest is fun to read so let‚Äôs keep it at that.
 Suicide is always a distasteful subject.
 üòí The other signs were just hacking at their character and predicted when they'll die, but this was direct.
 Not in the mood to hear anyone tell others to kill themselves, regardless of context.
 Thanks for the death blow.
 Much too far.
 Lol.
 I don‚Äôt think any Aries will feel offended... Leo cracks me up.
 It‚Äôs probably the most accurate in 2020.
 Virgos and bus drivers.
 Lol.
 I see them more as librarians.
 And poor cancers... also Caps, don‚Äôt kill yourselves please!!!
 I've not quite hit the venereal disease part, but Libra seems to be on track for now!
 It could be you.
 This hurts.
 So I guess I'm a bisexual murderer who will never be worth shit.
 Ha!
 EVERYBODY IN PRISON IS A CANCER.
 i know y'all are out there!
 You‚Äôre not worth the time of day.‚Äù Given Spiro Agnew was a Scorpio, the author makes some valid points.
 I forgot to kiss my mirror a couple times today.
 Whoops !
 I‚Äôm in danger.
 XD This was written in '79, after all.
 I remember this circulating when I was a kid!
 There were all kinds of them floating around back then!
 From this one to the origin and uses of the word fuck in the English language.
 üòÑüòÇü§£üòÇüòÑ My dad was always getting these things, copied and passed around at work, and they were always funny as hell!
 weird.
 Who wrote this?
 Nixon is a Capricorn!
 And we Caps earned that.
 And maybe also a bus driver.
 Shockingly accurate!
 I read for my Leo sun/moon and Scorpio rising!
 anyone else (am pisces, find it confusing, it's not familiar pisces behaviour to me).
 Have you ever met a Gemini that wasnt bisexual?
 If you have then congrats they fooled you.
 lmao!
 Capricorns is just BRUTAL!!
