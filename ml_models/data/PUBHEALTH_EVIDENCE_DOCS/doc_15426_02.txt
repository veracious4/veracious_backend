Adults aged 18
Œ64 were 
almost 
three times
 as likely
 as children 
to be 
uninsured at the time of interview
  
(Table 1

Public and private coverage
 In 2014
, 24.5
% of persons under 
age 65 were covered by public health 

plans 
at the 
time of interview (
Table 3
). 
More than two
-fifths of children were 
covered by a public plan
(42
.2
%), compared with 
17.7
% of adults aged 18
Œ64 (
Table 3
 and 
Figure 1
). Public coverage 
among adults aged 18
Œ64 increased from 
16.7%
 in 2013 to 17.7% in 2014. 
Public 
coverage among adults aged 19
Œ25 was 
19.1
% 
in 2014
 (
Table 3
), a significant 
increase 
from 2013 (16.1%)
. 
Between 
2013 and 
2014
, no significant changes 
were seen in the percentage of persons 

with public coverage among persons of all 

ages, those under 65, and children aged 

0Œ

 Among adults aged 18
Œ64, 
public 
coverage increased 
between 1997
 (10.2%) and 
2014
 (17.7
%) (

 Among persons under age 65,
 63.6
% (170.4

relatively stable from 1997 through 

2013
, 
with a significant decrease between 
2013 and 
2014
 (

, 
a generally increasing trend 
was 
seen 
from 1
997

 in the 
percentage who were uninsured
. However, there has been a
 decreasing 
trend from 2010 to 
2014
 in the 
uninsured among ne

The percentage of poor and n
ear
-poor children who were uninsured at the 

time of interview decreased from 1997 

through 
2014
 (
Figure 5
). However, the 
rate of decline during this period was 

greater for 
poor children. The percentage 

of near

uninsured at the time of interview 

decreased from 1997 to 2003, remained 

rel

 Age and sex
 In  
2014
, adults aged 25
Œ34 
were 
the most likely 
(22.6%)
 to lack health 
insuranc
e coverage
 at the time of 
interview 
(Table 7
). 
Among persons 
under age 65, children aged 0
Œ17 were 
the most likely to have public coverage 
(42.2
%), 
and adults aged 45
Œ64 were the 
most likely to have private coverage
 (71.5%)
. Among 
adu
lts in age groups 18
Œ24, 25
Œ34,
 35
Œ44,
 and 45

 as high as for 
those who were unemployed
 (29.6
%).  Adults aged 18

with family 
income 
less than 
100%
, 
and between 
100% and up to and including 138%
, 
of 
the federal poverty level (FPL) were the 
most likely to be uninsu

 relative to 
other income groups. Adults aged 18
Œ64 
with family incomes less than 100% FPL 
were
 the most likely to have public 
coverage
. Those
 with family income
 greater than 
400% FPL
 were the most 
likely to have private health insurance 
coverage.
 Married adults aged 18
Œ64
 were 
less
 likely to

than those who were 
widowed,

Estimates of enrollment in 
HDHPs, CDHPs, and FSAs
 In 
2014
, 36
.9% of persons under 
age 65 with private health insurance were 
enrolled in an HDHP, including 
13.3
% who were enrolled in a CDHP (
an HDHP
 with a health savings account [HSA]
) and 
23.6
% who were enrolled in an HDHP 
without an HSA (
Figure 7
 and 
Table 
10
). 
(See 
Technical Notes
 for definitions of 
HDHP, CDHP, and HSA.) 
Among those 
with private insurance, the percentage 

who were enrolled in an HDHP 
increased 

between 2013
 (33.9%)
 and 
2014
 (36.9
%). 
HDHPs constitute a 
significant 
share of both employment
-based and 
directly purchased health plans.
 Based on 
data from 
2014
, amo
ng persons under 
age 65
 with private health insurance
, 36.2
% with employment
-based coverage 
were enrolled in an HDHP (
Table 11
), an 
increase from 201
3 (
32.0
%). 
Also in that 
age group
, 54.1
% with directly purchased 
private health pl
ans were enrolled in an 
HDH
P in 
2014
. 
This was a decrease from 
2013 (56.4%).
 In 
2014
, among persons under age 
65 with private health insurance, 2
1.2
% were in a family that had an FSA for 

medical expenses (
Table 10
). (See

 Under provisions of
 ACA,
 states 
have the option to expand Medicaid 
coverage to 
those with low
 income
. 
Health insurance estimates
 by state 
Medicaid expansion status (as of October 
31, 2013), including the District of

are presented for 
all 
persons 
under age 65,
 children aged 0
Œ17,
 and

 In 
2014
, adults aged 18
Œ64 
residing 
in 
Medicaid expansion 
states were less 
likely to be uninsured than 
those
 residing 
in 
nonexpansion

. In 
Medicaid

, 
the percentage 
of those 
uninsured de
creased from 18.4% in 2013 
to 13.3

.  
In

were more 
likely to have public coverage
 (19.9

between 2013 and 
2014
.  
In 
2014
, among adults aged 18

to be uninsured than 
those
 in states with 
a state

Decreases
 were seen
 in the uninsured rates between 
2013 and 
2014
 in 
states with a state

 For children 
in states with a state

NHIS, lack of health 
insurance coverage at the time of 
interview among adults aged 18
Œ64 was 
greatest in the South 
region
 (
20.7
%) 
(Table 9
). The highest rate
s 
of public 
coverage 
were
 in the
 Northeast (19.2

, and the highest rates 
of private coverage were
 in the Northeast 
(70.9
%) and Midwest (
71.9

interview were significantly higher than 

the national average 
of 
13.3
% 
in 
the

Central, and West North Central regions
.  In the 
United States
 overall, 24.
5% of persons under age 65 had public

that were 
significantly lower than the national 

average. 
The East South Central

mployer, 
purchased directly, 
purchased through local or community programs

 5FPL 
is federal poverty level. 
Based
 on family income and family size, using the U.S. Census Bureau™s poverty thresholds. 
The percentage of respondents with ﬁUnknownﬂ poverty 
status for this 
five
-level 
categorization is 
10.0
%. This value is greater than t
he 
corresponding value for the three
-level poverty categorization because of greater uncertainty when 
assigning individuals to more detailed poverty groups. 
For more information on 
poverty status

Technical Notes
. Estimates may dif
fer from estimates that are based on bo
th 
reported and imputed income.

1An HDHP 
was defined in 201
4 
as a health plan with an annu
al 
deductible of at least $1,250
 for self
-only 
coverage and $2,5
00 for family coverage. The deductible is adjusted annually 
for inflation. Deductibles for previous years are included in 
Technical Notes
. 
2An HSA
 is a tax
-advantaged acco
unt or fund that can be used to pay for medical expenses. It must be coupled with an HDHP. 
 3A CDHP is an HDHP coupled with an HSA. 
 NOTES: 
The measures of HDHP enrollment, CDHP enrollment, and being in a family with an FSA for medical expenses are not mut
ually exclusive. Therefore, a person may be counted 
in more than one measure. The individual components of HD
HPs may not add up to the total
 due to rounding
. 
Data are based on household interviews of a sample of the civilian 
noninstitutionalized 
population.

  Health Insurance Coverage: Early Release of Estimates From the National Health Interview Survey, 2014
  Technical Notes
 The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention™s (CDC) National Center for 
Health Statistics (NCHS) is releasing 

selected estimates of health insurance 

coverage for the civilian 
noninstitutionalized U.S. population 
based on data from the 
2014 
National 
Health Interview Survey (NHIS), along 

with comparable estimates from the 

200
9Œ
201
3 
NHIS.
 To reflect different policy
-relevant 
perspectives, t
hree measures of lack of 
health insurance coverage are provided: 

(a) uninsured at the time of interview, 
 
(b) uninsured at least part of the year 

prior to interview (which also includes 

persons uninsured for more than a year), 
and (c) uninsured for more than a year at 
the time of interview. T
he
 three 
time 
frames are 
defin
ed as
:  
  Uninsured
 at the time of inter
view
 provides an estimate of persons who 
at any given time may have 
experienced barriers to obtaining 
needed health care. 
  Uninsured
 at any time in the year prior 
to interview
 provides an annual 
caseload of persons who may 

experience barriers
 to obtaining 
needed health care
. This measure 
includes persons who have insurance 
at the time of interview but who had 
a period of noncoverage in the year 

prior to interview, as well as those 

who are currently uninsured and 

who may have been uninsured for a 

long period
 of time.
  Uninsured
 for more than a year
 provides an estimate of those with a 

persistent lack of coverage who may 
be at high risk of not obtaining 
preventive services or care for illness 

and injury.
 These three measures are not 
mutually exclusive, and a gi
ven individual 
may be counted in more than one of the 

measures. Estimates of enrollment in 

public and private coverage are also 

provided. 
 This report also includes estimates 
for
 three types of consumer
-directed 
private health care. Consumer
-directed 
healt
h care may enable individuals to 
have more control over when and how 

they access care, what types of care they 

use, and how much they spend on health 
care services. National attention to 
consumer
-directed health care increased 
following enactment of the Me
dicare 
Prescription Drug Improvement and 

Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108
Œ173), which established tax
-advantaged 
health savings accounts (HS
As) (1). In 
2007, three new 
questions were added to 

the health insurance section of NHIS to 

monitor enrollment in
 consumer
-directed health care among persons with 

private health insurance. Estimates are 
provided for enrollment in high
-deductible health plans (HDHPs), plans 
with high deductibles coupled with HSAs 

(i.e., consumer
-directed health plans
 or
 CDHPs), and be
ing in a family with a 
flexible spending account (FSA) for 
medical expenses not otherwise covered. 
For a more complete description of 

consumer
-directed health care, see 
ﬁDefinitions of selected termsﬂ below.
 The 
2014 
health insurance 
estimates are being re
leased prior to final 
data editing and final weighting, to 
provide access to the most recent 

information from NHIS. Differences 

between estimates calculated using 

preliminary data files and final data files 

are typically less than 0.1 percentage 
point. How
ever, preliminary estimates of 
persons without health insurance 
coverage are generally 0.1
Œ0.3 percentage 
point
s 
lower than the final estimates due 
to the editing procedures used for the 

final data files. 
 Estimates for 
201
4 
are stratified by 
age group, se
x, race/ethnicity, poverty 
status, marital status, employment 

status, region, and educational 

attainment.
 Data 
source
 NHIS is a multistage probability 
sample survey of the civilian 

noninstitutionalized population of the 

United States and is the source of d
ata 

for this report. The survey is conducted 

continuously throughout the year 
by 
NCHS through an agreement with the
 U.S. Census Bureau.
 NHIS is a comprehensive health 
survey that can be used to relate health 
insurance coverage to health outcomes 

and health
 care utilization. It has a low 
item nonresponse rate (about 1%) for the 

health insurance questions. Because 

NHIS is conducted throughout the year
Šyielding a nationally representative 

sample each month
Šdata can be 
analyzed monthly or quarterly to monitor 

health insurance coverage trends.
 The fundamental structure of the 
current NHIS 
oversamples Hispanic, 
black, and Asian populations. 
Visit the 
NCHS website at: 

http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm
 for 
more information on the design, content, 

and use of NHIS.
 The data for this report are derived 
from the Family Core component of the 

2009
Œ201
4 
NHIS, which collects 
information on all family members in 

each household. Da
ta analyses for the 
2014 
NHIS were based on 
111,682
 persons in the Family Core.
  
Data on health insurance status 
were edited using an automated system 

based on logic checks and keyword 

searches. Information from follow
-up 
questions
, such as
 plan name(s)
, 
were
 used to reassign insurance status and 
type of coverage to avoid
 misclassification. For comparability, the 

estimates for all years were created using 
these same procedures.
 The analyses 
excluded persons with unknown health 

insurance status (about 1% of
 respondents each year).
 Estimation
 procedures
 NCHS creates survey weights for 
each calendar quarter of the NHIS 

sample. The NHIS data weighting 

procedure is described in more detail at: 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_
02/sr02_165.pdf
. 
Estimates were 
calculated using NHIS survey weights, 

which are calibrated to census totals for 

sex, age, and race/ethnicity of the U.S. 

civilian noninstitutionalized population. 
Weights for 
200
9Œ
201
1 were derived 
from 2000 
census
-based population 
estimates. Beginning with 2012 NHIS 
data, weights were derived from 2010
 census
-based population estimates.
 Point estimates and estimates of 
their variances were calculated using 

SUDAAN software 
(RTI
 International
, Research Triangle Park
, N.C.) 
to account 
for the complex sample design of NHIS, 

taking into account stratum and primary 

sampling unit (PSU) identifiers. The

 Taylor series linearization method was 
chosen for variance estimation. 
 Trends in c
overage were 
generally 
assessed using Joinpoint regression (2), 

which
 characterizes trends as joined 
linear segments. A 
Joinpoint 
is the year 
where two segments with different slopes 

meet. Joinpoint software uses statistical 

criteria to determine the fewes
t number 
of segments necessary to characterize a 

trend and the year(s) when segments 

begin and end.
 Trends from 2010 to 201
4 
were also evaluated using logistic 

regression analysis. 
 State
-specific health insurance 
estimates are presented for 
all 50 
state
s 
and the District
 of Columbia
 for persons 
of all ages, persons under age 65, and 
adults aged 18
Œ64. State
-specific 
estimates are presented for 
40
 states for 
children aged 0
Œ17.
 Estimates are not 
presented for
 all 50
 states and the 
District of Columbia 
for c
hildren 
due to 
considerations of sample size and 
precision.
 All states had at least 
1,000 
interviews for persons of all ages
. 
Estimates for children in states that did 
not have at least 300 children with 

completed interviews are not presented. 
 For the 10 
states with the largest 
populations (California, Florida, Georgia, 
Illinois, Michigan, New York, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas), 

standard errors (SEs) were calculated 

using SUDAAN. Because of small sample 

sizes and limitations in the NHIS d
esign, 
similarly estimated SEs for other states 
could be statistically unstable or 
negatively biased; consequently, for 

states other than the largest 10 states, an 

estimated design effect was used to 

calculate SEs. For this report, the design 

effect, 
deff
, 
of a percentage is the ratio of 
the sampling variance of the percentage 

(taking into account the complex NHIS 

sample design) to the sampling variance 

of the percentage from a simple random 

sample (SRS) based on the same observed 

number of persons.
 Therefo
re, for each health insurance 
measure and domain, SEs for smaller 

states were calculated by multiplying the 

SRS SE by 
A, where 
A is the average value 
of the square root of 
deff
 over the 10 
most populous states. Values of 
A ranged 
from 1.55 for children who were 

uninsured  to 2.30 for persons under 65 

with private coverage.
 Calculation of SEs of the differences 
between state and expanded regional 

estimates and national estimates 

accounted for correlations.
 Unless otherwise n
oted, all 
estimates shown meet the NCHS 
standard of having less than or equal to 
30% relative standard error. Differences 

between percentages or rates were 

evaluated using two
-sided significance 
tests at the 0.05 level.
 All differences 
discussed are signif
icant unless otherwise 
noted.
 Lack of comment regarding the

 Definitions of selected terms
 Private health insurance 
coverage
ŠInclu
des persons who had 
any comprehensive private insurance 

plan (including health maintenance and 
preferred provider organizations). These 
plans include those obtained through an 

employer, purchased directly, purchased 

through local or community programs
, or 
purchased through the Health Insurance 

Marketplace or a state
-based exchange
. Private coverage excludes plans that pay 

for only one type of service, such as 

accidents or dental care.
 Public health plan coverage
ŠIncludes Medicaid, Children™s Health 
Insuranc
e Program (CHIP), state
-sponsored or other government
-sponsored health plans, Medicare, and 

military plans. A small number of persons 

were covered by both public and private 

plans and were included in both 
categories. 
 Uninsured
ŠA person was defined 
as uni
nsured if he or she did not have any 
private health insurance, Medicare, 
Medicaid, CHIP, state
-sponsored or other 
government
-sponsored health plan, or 
military plan at the time of interview. A 

person was also defined as uninsured if 

he or she had only Indi
an Health Service 
coverage or had only a private plan that 

paid for one type of service, such as 
accidents or dental care. 
 Directly purchased coverage
ŠPrivate insurance that was originally 
obtained through direc
t purchase or 
other means not related to emp
loyment. 
 Employment
-based coverage
ŠPrivate insurance that was originally 
obtained through a present or former 

employer or union or a professional 

association.
  
Exchange
-based coverage
ŠA 
private health insurance plan 
purchased 
through the Health Insurance 
Marketplace or state
-based exchanges 
that were established as part of the 

Affordable Care Act 
(ACA). 
of 2010 
(P.L. 
111
Œ148, 
P.L. 111
Œ152) 
In response to 
ACA, several new questions were added 
to NHIS to capture health care 
plans
 obtained through exchange
-based 
coverage.
  
In general, if a family member is 
reported to have coverage through the 
exchange, that report
 is considered 
accurate unless there is other 

information (e.g., plan name or 

information about premiums) that 

clearly 
contradicts that report. Similarly, 
if a family member 
is not reported to 
have coverage through the exchange, that 
report 
is considered accurate unless there 
is other information that clearly 
contradicts that report. For a more 

complete discussion of the p
rocedures 
used in the classification of exchange
-based coverage
, 
see 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/insurance
.htm
.  Based on these classification 
procedures, an average of 
2.
2% (SE
, 
0.1
0) of persons 
under age 65
, 
2.
7% (
SE
, 
0.11
) of adults aged 18
Œ64,
 0.9
% (SE
, 
0.11
) of children under age 
18, and 1.9
% (SE
, 
0.17
) of adults aged 19
Œ25, 
had 
exchange
-based private health insurance 
coverage
 in 2014
. 
This
 equates to 
5.
9 
million persons
 under age 65 
and 
5.2
 million adults
 aged 18
Œ64
, 0.7
 million 
children
, 
and 
0.6
 million adults aged 19
Œ25
. 
If these procedures had not been used 
and reports of coverage through the 
exchanges (or lack thereof) had been 

taken at face value, the e
stimate would 
have been higher
. For example, a
n 
average of 
3.0
% (7.9
 million) of persons 
under age 65
 would have
 been reported 
to have obtained their coverage through 

exchanges
 over the full year of 
 2014
.  
High
-deductible health plan 
(HDHP)
ŠFor persons with priv
ate 
health insurance, a q
uestion
 was asked
 regarding the annual deductible of each 

private health 
insurance plan
. An HDHP 
was defined in 2013 and 2014 
as a 

private health plan with an annual

 deductible of at least $1,250 for self
-only 
coverage or $2,500 for family coverage. 
The de
ductible is adjusted annually for
 inflation. For 2010 through 2012, the 

annual deductible for self
-only coverage 
was $1,200 and for family coverage was 

$2,400. For 2009, the annual deductible 
for self
-only coverage was $1,150 and for 
family coverage was $2
,300. 
 Consumer
-directed health plan 
(CDHP)
ŠDefined as an HDHP with a 
special account to pay for medical 
expenses. Unspent funds are carried over 

to subsequent years. 
For plans considered 

to be HDHPs, a follow
-up question was 
asked regarding 
these special 
accounts
. 
A person is considered to have a CDHP if 
there was a ﬁyesﬂ response to the 
following question: 
With this plan, is there 

a special account or fund that can be used to 

pay for medical expenses? The accounts are 

sometimes referred to as Health Savin
gs 
Accounts (HSAs), Health Reimbursement 
Accounts (HRAs), Personal Care accounts, 
Personal Medical funds, or Choice funds, 

and are different from Flexible Spending 

Accounts.
 Health savings account (HSA)
ŠA 
tax
-advantaged account or fund that 
can be used to pay for medical expenses. 

It must be coupled with an HDHP. The 

funds contributed to the account are not 

subject to federal income tax at t
he time 
of deposit. Unlike 
FSAs, HSA funds roll 

over and accumulate year to year if not 

spent. HSAs are owned by the i
ndividual. 
Funds may be used to pay for qualified 

medical expenses at any time without 

federal tax liability. HSAs may also be 
referred to as Health Reimbursement 
Accounts (HRAs), Personal Care 

accounts, Personal Medical funds, or 

Choice funds, and the ter
m ﬁHSAﬂ in this 
report includes accounts that use these 

alternative names. 
 Flexible spending account (FSA) 
for medical expenses
ŠA person is 
considered to be in a family with an FSA 

if there was a ﬁyesﬂ response to the 
following question
: [Do you/Does anyo
ne 
in your family] have a Flexible Spending 
Account for health expenses? These accounts 

are offered by some employers to allow 

employees to set aside pretax dollars of their 
own money for their use throughout the year 
to reimburse themselves for their out
-of
-pocket expenses for health care. With this 

type of account, any money remaining in the 
account at the end of the year, following a 
short grace period, is lost to the employee.
 The measures of HDHP enrollment, 
CDHP enrollment, and being in a family 
with 
an FSA for medical expenses are not 
mutually exclusive; a person may be 

counted in more than one measure.
 Medicaid expansion status
ŠUnder provisions of 
the Affordable Care 

Act 
(ACA) 
of 20
10 (P.L. 111
Œ148, P.L. 
111
Œ152)
, states have the option to 
expand Med
icaid eligibility to cover 
adults who have income up to 
and 
including 
138% of the federal poverty 
level. There is no deadline for states to 

choose to implement the Medicaid 

expansion, and they may do so at any 

time. As of October 31, 2013, 26 states 
and th
e District of Columbia are moving 
forward with Medicaid expansion.
 Health Insurance Marketplace
ŠA resource where individuals, families, 
and small businesses can learn about 
their health coverage options; compare 
health insurance plans based on cost, 

benefi
ts, and other important features; 
choose a plan; and enroll in coverage. The 

marketplace also provides information 

on pro
grams that help people with low
-to-moderate income and resources pay 
for coverage. There are three types of 

Health Insurance Marketplac
es: (a) a 
State
-based Marketplace set up and 
operated solely by the sta
te;
 (b) a hybrid 
Partnership Marketplace in which the 
state runs certain functions and makes 
key decisions and may tailor the 

marketplace to local needs and market 

conditions, but which
 is operated by the 
federal government; and (c) the Federally 

Facilitated Marketplace operated solely 
by the federal government. 
 Education
ŠThe
 categories of 
education are based on the years of 
school completed or highest degree 

obtained for persons aged 18 and over. 
 Employment
ŠEmployment status 
is assessed at the time of interview and is 

obtained for persons aged 18 and over. In 

this release, it is presented only for 

persons aged 18
Œ64.
 Hispanic or Latino origin an
d 
race
ŠHispanic or Latino origin and race 
are two separate and distinct categories. 

Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin may 
be of any race or combination of races. 
Hispanic or Latino origin includes 

persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, 
Central and South American, or Spanish 
origin. Race is based on the family 
respondent™s description of his or her 

own race background, as well as the race 

background of other family members. 

More tha
n one race may be reported for a 
person. For conciseness, the text, tables, 
and figures in this report use shorter 
versions of the 1997 Office of 

Management and Budget (OMB) terms 

for race and Hispanic or Latino origin. 

For example, the category ﬁNot Hispa
nic 
or Latino, black or African American, 
single raceﬂ is referred to as ﬁnon
-Hispanic black, single raceﬂ in the text, 
tables, and figures. Estimates for non
-Hispanic persons of races other than 

white only, black only, and Asian only, or 

of multiple races
, are combined into the 
ﬁOther races and multiple racesﬂ 

category. 
 Poverty status
ŠPoverty 
categories are based on the ratio of the 

family™s income in the previous calendar 
year to the appropriate poverty threshold 
(given the family™s size and number of 

children) defined by the U.S. Census 
Bureau for that year (3
Œ8). Persons 
categorized as ﬁPoorﬂ have a ratio less 

than 1.0 (i.e., their family income was 

below the poverty threshold); ﬁNear
-poorﬂ persons have incomes of 100% to 

less than 200% of the poverty t
hreshold; 
and ﬁNot
-poorﬂ persons have incomes 
that are 200% of the poverty threshold or 

greater. The remaining group of 

respondents is coded as ﬁUnknownﬂ with 
respect to poverty status. The percentage 
of respondents with unknown poverty 

status (12.3% in 2009, 12.2% in 2010, 

11.5% in 2011, 11.4% in 2012
, 
10.2% in 
2013
, 
and 
8.8
% in 2014
) is disaggregated 
by age and insurance status
 in 
Tables 4
, 5, and 
6. 
For more information on unknown 
income and unknown poverty status, see 

the NHIS Survey Description document 

for 
200
9Œ
201
3 
(available from: 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/quest_
 data_related_1997_forward.htm
). NCHS imputes income for 
approximately 30% of NHIS records. The 

imputed income files are released a few 

months after the annual release of NHIS 

microdata and are not available for the 
ER updates. Therefore, ER health 
insurance estimates stratified by poverty 

status are based on reported income only

) is published 
quarterly and provides estimates of 15 

selected measures of health, including 

insurance coverage. Other measures of 
health include estimates of having a usual 

place to go for medical care, obtaining 

needed medical car
e, influenza 
vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination, 

obesity, leisure
-time physical activity, 
current smoking, alcohol 
consumption, 

HIV testing, general health status, 

personal care needs, serious psychological 

distress, diagnosed diabetes, and asthma 

episo
des and current asthma.
 Wireless Substitution: Early Release of 
Estimates From the National Health 

Interview Survey
 (12) is published in June 
and December and provides selected 

estimates of telephone coverage in the 

United States.
 Other ER reports and tabu
lations 
on special topics are released on an as
-needed basis. See: 

http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/
 
releases.htm
. 
In addition to these reports, 
preliminary microdata files containing 
selected NHIS variables are produced as 
part of the ER Program. 
For each data 

collection year (January through 

December), these variables are
 made 
available three times: about September 

(with data from the first quarter), about 
December (with data from the first two 
quarters), and about March of the 

following year (with data from the first 

three quarters).
 NHIS data users can 
analyze these files through the 
NCHS 

Research Data Center
s without having to 
wait for the final annual NHIS microdata 

files to be released. 
 New measures and products may be 
added as work continues and in response 

to changing data needs. Feedback on 

these releases is welcome (
e-
mail
). Announcements about ERs, other 
new
 data releases, and publications, as 
well as corrections related to NHIS, will 

be sent to members of the HISUSERS 

electronic mailing list. To join, visit the
