 This is the site where you will learn about our ongoing project to synthesize the genome – from oligos to chromosomes, and the design features of the new version of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which we fondly refer to as Sc2.0.
 Also, these pages describe the Build-A-Genome course, an innovative educational program to engage undergraduate students and others directly in the Sc2.0 project by producing Building Blocks that will be directly used in the project.
 These pages also serve as a forum for engaging the yeast and synthetic biology communities in a new initiative to synthesize a modified version of the genome, chromosome by chromosome, from the “bottom up”.
 We welcome input on the best design features for yeast 2.0 – or future versions.
 An important aspect of this will be to leverage the formidable collective knowledgebase of the yeast and synthetic biology communities.
