in its ability to classify the speci˜c drugs. In ICDŒ10, drugs are often grouped into broad categories, making it dif˜cult to identify 
deaths involving a speci˜c drug. For example, oxycodone and 

morphine are both classi˜ed in the same category of Natural and 

semisynthetic opioid analgesics (ICDŒ10 code T40.2) (5).To better understand the contribution of speci˜c drugs to 
drug overdose deaths, researchers have turned to the literal 

text on death certi˜cates (6,7). The literal text is the written 
information provided by the medical certi˜er, usually a medical 

examiner or coroner in the case of drug overdose deaths (8,9), that describes the cause of death as well as other factors or 
circumstances that contributed to the death. The literal text has been used in other studies to investigate sudden unexplained 
infant deaths, cancer, and in˚uenza 
(10Œ13).  The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) collaboratively developed 
a method to analyze the death certi˜cate literal text to identify 
speci˜c drugs involved in deaths. Details of this method are 
described elsewhere (14). In this report, the method was applied 
to provide a more in-depth understanding of the national picture 
of the drugs involved in drug overdose deaths.  This report highlights the ˜ndings for the speci˜c drugs most frequently mentioned as being involved in drug overdose 
deaths from 2010 through 2014. Methods
Data source and study population
This descriptive analysis was conducted using data from 
NVSSŒM from 2010 through 2014. NVSSŒM contains cause of 
death, demographic, and geographic information extracted from 

death certi˜cates (15). The study population was limited to U.S. 
residents with an underlying cause of death of drug overdose 
(ICDŒ10 codes X40ŒX44, X60ŒX64, X85, and Y10ŒY14). Drug 
overdose deaths included all intents (i.e., unintentional, suicide, 
homicide, and undetermined), as there is variation in the intent 
reported across states 
(16). This code set limits the deaths to 
acute intoxication from drugs (i.e., drug overdose) as opposed to 
chronic exposure leading to death (e.g., liver toxicity) or adverse 

effects experienced from therapeutic or prophylactic dosages of 
drugs. Use of this code set is consistent with other NCHS and 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publications on drug 
overdose deaths and facilitates comparability with other analyses 
using the ICDŒ10-coded data (1Œ4).  NVSSŒM ˜les were linked to electronic ˜les containing literal text data that were also extracted from death certi˜cates 
(15). Drug mentions (described below) were identi˜ed using 
the literal text data from three ˜elds of the death certi˜cate: 
(1) the cause of death from Part I, (2) signi˜cant conditions 
contributing to death from Part II, and (3) a description of how 
the injury occurred from Box 43 
(17). For some deaths, the literal 
text was uninformative, because 
(1) the ˜elds only contained 
information about the status of the investigation (e.g., mentions 
of ﬁPENDINGﬂ or ﬁUNDER INVESTIGATIONﬂ) or 
(2) the literal text 
was not available (i.e., no text in the three literal text ˜elds) (14).Identifying drugs involved 
For this report, drugs of interest included pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical drugs, including speci˜c drugs, classes of drugs, and nonspeci˜c references to exposures to drugs (e.g., 
words such as ﬁDRUG,ﬂ ﬁMULTIDRUG,ﬂ and ﬁPOLYPHARMACYﬂ). 

Substances that were excluded from consideration as a drug 
included alcohols (e.g., ethanol and isopropyl alcohol), nicotine, 
food and food additives (e.g., starch), excipients, gases (e.g., 

helium and carbon monoxide), airborne contaminants (e.g., 
soot), industrial chemicals (e.g., ethylene glycol), periodic table 
elements (e.g., lithium and iodine), and substances with no 
known industrial, pharmaceutical, or abuse application. Mention 
of alcohol was noted only when the death also included mention 
of a drug on the death certi˜cate.The method used to characterize the drugs involved in deaths using the literal text was recently developed and is described in a 
separate companion report (14). This method searches the literal 

text ˜elds for mentions of drugs as well as for terms that provide 
context about drug involvement. Software programs (referred to 
as the Drug Mentioned with Involvement [DMI] programs) were 
developed using SAS Version 9.3 to automate the process 
(18). The DMI programs automate the identi˜cation of mentions of drugs within the literal text using various search terms. Search 

terms included generic drug names or other variants (e.g., 
brand names, common usage or street names, abbreviations, 
metabolites, misspellings, and variants not otherwise speci˜ed 

[NOS]). Search terms were categorized by whether they referred 

to speci˜c drugs (e.g., methadone), classes of drugs (e.g., 

opioids), or exposures NOS (e.g., pharmaceutical). Each search 

term was mapped to a principal variant, usually the generic drug 
name, thus enabling aggregate counts for all search terms that 

referred to the same drug. The DMI programs also identi˜ed combinations of words adjacent to each search term to provide context, and for the 

purposes of this study, to identify instances when the drug was 

not involved in the death. For example, the phrase ﬁMETHICILLIN 
RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS INFECTIONﬂ does 

not suggest drug involvement in mortality, but rather a type of 

bacterial infection. Similarly, the phrase ﬁNOT DRUG RELATEDﬂ 

clearly indicates that the death did not involve drugs, even though 
ﬁDRUGﬂ is mentioned in the phrase. Unless the contextual 
information indicated otherwise, drugs mentioned in the literal 

text were assumed to be involved in the death. The DMI programs enabled the identi˜cation of concomitant drug mentions (i.e., mentions of multiple drugs involved in the 
death) as well as the identi˜cation of concomitant mentions of 

drugs and alcohol within the literal text.Analysis
Results were reported as numbers, percentages, or rates 
for each drug of interest, referred to as the referent drug. Age-adjusted death rates were calculated using the direct method 
and the 2000 standard U.S. population (15). Trends in death 

rates and number of deaths were evaluated using the JoinPoint 
Regression Program (19). Any mention of an average percent 

change (APC) in this report indicates a statistically signi˜cant  National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 65, No. 10, December 20, 2016 3trend. Comparisons of rates between years were tested for 
statistical signi˜cance using methods described elsewhere 
(15). A statement that a given death rate is higher or lower than 
another rate indicates that the change in rates was statistically 
signi˜cant at an alpha level of 0.05.Analyses of other drugs involved in death along with the referent drug, referred to as concomitant drugs, were also 
conducted. Only deaths with at least two speci˜c drugs (i.e., 
the referent drug and at least one concomitant drug) involved 
in death were included in these analyses. For deaths with two 

or more speci˜c drugs involved in death, the average number of 

drugs other than the referent drug was calculated.Results
 From 2010 through 2014, the number of drug overdose deaths per year increased 23%, from 38,329 in 2010 to 47,055 in 2014 (
Table A
). During this same 
time period, the speci˜city 
of drug information in the literal text ˜elds of the death certi˜cate 
improved. There was a steady increase in the percentage of drug 

overdose deaths involving at least one speci˜c drug, from 67% 
in 2010 to 78% in 2014. There was a decline in the percentage 

of deaths involving only a drug class (e.g., ﬁOPIOIDﬂ) but not a 
speci˜c drug (from 4% of drug overdose deaths in 2010 to 3% in 
2014). A review of the literal text for these deaths indicated that 
the mentioned class was either an opioid or opiate (ranging from 
69% in 2014 to 74% in 2011). There were also steady declines 
in the percentage of deaths without mention of a speci˜c drug 

or drug class, from 29% of drug overdose deaths in 2010 to 
19% in 2014. These deaths frequently involved multiple drugs (e.g., mentions of ﬁPO
LYPHARMACY,ﬂ ﬁMU
LTIDRUG,ﬂ and ﬁDRUGSﬂ), 
ranging from 40% in 2010 to 51% in 2014. Drug overd
ose deaths with mention of at least 
one specific drug
Tables BŒE and 
Figures 1Œ5 present information on the specific drugs involved in the deaths where at least one specific 
drug was mentioned on the death certificate (Tables 1Œ5). The drug overdose death rate involving any particular drug in any 

particular year should be considered the minimum rate, as there 
may be additional deaths in which the drug was involved but 
not speci˜ed in the literal text. Moreover, these results should 

be interpreted in light of the improved reporting of speci˜c 
drugs in the literal text. For instance, the relative increase in the 
deaths involving a speci˜c d
rug over time could re˚ect either 
improvements in reporting of that speci˜c drug, an increase in 

drug overdose deaths involving that drug, or both. In addition, 

the rankings of the drugs might also be impacted if the reported 
drugs are distributed in a different way than unreported drugs.  
Table B shows the ranking of the top 10 drugs involved in drug overdose deaths for each year from 2010 through 2014. 

These top 10 drugs belong to three drug classes: opioids (heroin, 
oxycodone, methadone, morphine, hydrocodone, and fentanyl), 

benzodiazepines (alprazolam and diazepam), and stimulants 

(cocaine and methamphetamine). While the ranking changed 
from year to year, the top 10 drugs involved in drug overdose 

deaths remained consistent throughout the 5-year period.     ŁOxycodone ranked ˜rst in 2010 and 2011 among drugoverdose deaths. Heroin ranked ˜rst from 2012 through
2014. ŁThe number of drug overdose deaths that involved heroin

more than tripled, from 3,020 deaths, or 8% of all drug
overdose deaths in 2010, to 10,863 deaths, or 23% of all
drug overdose deaths in 2014. ŁEach year, cocaine ranked second or third among drugs

involved in drug overdose deaths. ŁFrom 2010 through 2012, fentanyl was involved in
approximately 1,600 drug overdose deaths each year.

Fentanyl involvement increased to 1,905 deaths in 2013 and
to 4,200 deaths in 2014. ŁThe number of drug overdose deaths that involved

methadone decreased, from 4,408 in 2010 to 3,495 in 2014.
 ŁThe number of drug overdose deaths that involved

methamphetamine increased, from 1,388 in 2010 to 3,728
in 2014.Figures 1Œ3 and Tables 1Œ3
 show the trends from 2010through 2014 in the age-adjusted rates of drug overdose deaths involving the top 10 mentioned drugs on death certi˜cates. 

The improvements in reporting should be considered when 

interpreting these trends.  ŁFrom 2010 through 2014, the age-adjusted rate of all
drug overdose deathsŠwhether or not a speci˜c drug
was involvedŠincreased, from 12.3 to 14.7 per 100,000
population with an estimated APC of 4.1%. ŁAmong deaths with at least one drug speci˜ed on the death
certi˜cate, there was also an increase in the age-adjusted
mortality rate, from 8.2 per 100,000 population in 2010 to
11.5 per 100,000 in 2014 (APC = 7.9%). ŁFrom 2010 through 2014, the age-adjusted rate of drug
overdose deaths involving heroin more than tripled, from
1.0 per 100,000 population to 3.5 per 100,000
(APC = 36.3%) (Figure 1, Table 1
). ŁThe age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths involving
morphine also increased, from 0.9 per 100,00 population
in 2010 to 1.2 per 100,000 in 2014 (APC = 7.9%)
(Figure 1, Table 1
). ŁThe age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths involving
methadone decreased, from 1.5 per 100,000 population in
2011 to 1.1 per 100,000 in 2014 (APC = ˛6.8%)
(Figure 1, Table 1
). ŁFrom 2013 through 2014, the age-adjusted rate of drug
overdose deaths involving fentanyl increased, from 0.6
per 100,000 population to 1.3 per 100,000 in a single year
(Figure 1, Table 1
). ŁFrom 2010 through 2014, the age-adjusted rate of drug
overdose deaths involving cocaine steadily increased, from
1.4 per 100,000 population to 1.8 per 100,000 (APC = 5.8%) 

(Figure 3, Table 3
). ŁThe age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths involving

methamphetamine more than doubled, from 0.5 per
100,000 population in 2010 to 1.2 per 100,000 in 2014

(APC = 25.4 %) (Figure 3, Table 3
). 4

5Drug overdose deaths involving multiple drugs
Figure 4 shows the number of drug overdose deaths in 2014 by the number of  speci˜c drugs involved in the death (Table 4
). Of the 36,667 drug overdose deaths with at least one mention of a speci˜c drug, 52% mentioned only one speci˜c drug (18,931 
deaths), 26% mentioned two (9,351 deaths), 12% mentioned 
three (4,521 deaths), 6% mentioned four (2,041 deaths), and 5% 
mentioned ˜ve or more (1,823 deaths). Among drug overdose 
deaths with at least one mention of a speci˜c drug, the average 
number of speci˜c drugs mentioned was 1.9.  Table C
 shows the percentage of drug overdose deaths with 
concomitant drugs for drug overdose deaths involving the top 10 
drugs in 2014. The percentage of deaths involving concomitant 

drugs varied by referent drug. For example, the majority of 
the drug overdose deaths involving methamphetamine did 
not involve other drugs.  In contrast, among deaths involving 
alprazolam and diazepam, more than 95% involved other drugs. 
The average number of concomitant drugs involved (excluding 

the referent drug) also varied among the top 10 drugs involved 
in drug overdose deaths. For example, drug overdose deaths 
involving diazepam or alprazolam had on average more than 
two additional drugs involved in death. Drug overdose deaths 
involving fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine had on 
average fewer than two additional drugs involved in death. Figure 5 shows the percent distribution of the number 
of concomitant drugs for overdose deaths involving the top 
10 drugs in 2014 (Table 5
). For example, for drug overdose deaths involving methamphetamine, 55% had no concomitant 

mentions, 25% mentioned one other drug, 18% mentioned two 
to four other drugs, and 1% mentioned ˜ve or more drugs. In 
contrast, for drug overdose deaths involving diazepam, 3% had * Increasing or decreasing trend is statistically significant.ƒ Increase from 2013 to 2014 is statistically significant.

Study findings
The number of drug overdose deaths in the United States 
has increased substantially over the past two decades (1,20). 
From 2010 through 2014, the number of drug overdose deaths 

increased by 23%, from 38,329 in 2010 to 47,055 in 2014. 
The most frequently mentioned drugs involved in these deaths 

were the opioids: heroin, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, 
hydrocodone, and fentanyl; the benzodiazepines: alprazolam and 

diazepam; and the stimulants: cocaine and methamphetamine.  
Reporting of specific drugs
The reporting of speci˜c drugs on death certi˜cates improved during the study period. In 2010, 67% of drug 

overdose deaths included mentions of speci˜c drugs compared 
with 78% in 2014. Drug overdose deaths that did not mention a 

speci˜c drug fall into two groupsŠthose in which only a drug 
class was mentioned (3%Œ4% of all drug overdose deaths), Figure 4. Number of drug overdose deaths, by the number of specific drugs involved: United States, 2014

Deaths may involve other drugs in addition to

isopropyl alcohol, and a nonspecific reference to alcohol.SOURCE: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, Mortality files linked with death certificate literal text.and those with no mention of involvement of a speci˜c drug or drug class (19%Œ30% of all drug overdose deaths). Of the 

deaths with only a drug class mentioned, more than two-thirds 
involved either opioids or opiates. Of the deaths with no mention 
of involvement of a speci˜c drug or drug class, nearly 50% had 
some indication that the deaths involved multiple drugs (e.g., 

mentions of ﬁPOLYPHARMACY,ﬂ or ﬁMULTIDRUGﬂ) 
(14).   The reporting of speci˜c drugs on the death certi˜cate has 
been previously examined using ICDŒ10 coded data (16,21). In 
an analysis using 2008Œ2010 mortality data, drug speci˜city 
ranged across different states. For example, in one state, about 
one-third of drug overdose deaths had the drugs speci˜ed on the 
death certi˜cate, whereas in several other states, more than 95% 
of the deaths had the drugs speci˜ed. In the past 5 years, there 
have been many activities to engage stakeholders to improve 
reporting (22).The ˜ndings in this report should be interpreted in light of the improvements in the quality of the data during the study 
period. For example, some of the observed increases in the 

rates of drug overdose deaths involving the top 10 drugs is likely 
attributable to improvements in reporting.Findings for specific drugs
The analyses of trends showed that, for some drugs, the  age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths increased considerably 

within a relatively short time frame. For example, during the 
5-year period, the rate of drug overdose deaths involving heroin
more than tripled, and the rate of drug overdose deaths involving

methamphetamine more than doubled. The rate of drug overdose deaths involving fentanyl more than doubled in a single year 

(from 2013 to 2014). Among the drugs discussed in this report, 
only methadone showed a decreasing drug overdose death rate, 
from 1.5 per 100,000 population in 2011 to 1.1 in 2014. In light 
of the improvements in the reporting of speci˜c drugs involved 
in drug overdose deaths, decreases in the rates of drug overdose 
deaths involving methadone are likely to be at least in part due 
to real decreases.The results from the literal text analysis highlight the 
involvement of multiple drugs in many drug overdose deaths. 

In 2014, of the 36,667 drug overdose deaths that mentioned at 

least one speci˜c drug involved in death, almost one-half (48%) 

mentioned the involvement of more than one speci˜c drug on 

the death certi˜cate. A small percentage of deaths (5%) involved 

˜ve or more speci˜c drugs. For the top 10 drugs involved in drug 

overdose deaths in 2014, the proportion of deaths that involved 

at least one other drug ranged from 45% to 97%. The average 

number of other drugs involved varied by drug. For example, 

more than 95% of drug overdose deaths involving diazepam 

or alprazolam also involved other drugs, with an average of 

two other drugs being mentioned as involved in the death. In 

contrast, 52% and 45% of drug overdose deaths involving heroin 

or methamphetamine, respectively, involved other drugs, with an 

average of fewer than two additional drugs mentioned.     
The combinations of drugs in drug overdose deaths are important to consider when interpreting the study ˜ndings. 
Importantly, the most frequently mentioned drugs involved in 

drug overdose deaths were often mentioned with each other. 

For example, heroin and cocaine were involved concomitantly 
in more than 2,000 deaths. Another pair, oxycodone and 

alprazolam, were involved concomitantly in more than 1,000 
deaths. Studies using the NVSS ICDŒ10-coded data have shown 
that benzodiazepines were involved in more than 30% of drug 
overdose deaths involving opioid analgesics (3). Recently, FDA 

started requiring its strongest warning to the drug labeling of 
prescription opioid pain and prescription opioid cough medicines 

and benzodiazepines after a review found that the growing 
combined use of opioid medicines with benzodiazepines or other 
drugs that depress the central nervous system have resulted in 

serious side effects, including slowed or dif˜cult breathing and 
deaths (23).  The most frequently mentioned concomitant drug often belonged in another drug class than the referent drug. However, 

in some instances, the most frequently mentioned drug was in 
the same class as the referent drug, and was assigned the same 
ICDŒ10 code. For example, hydrocodone and oxycodone are 
classi˜ed to the same ICDŒ10 codeŠNatural and semi-synthetic 
opioid analgesic (T40.2)Šand there were more than 500 deaths 
in 2014 involving both hydrocodone and oxycodone.  In 2014, 6,976 (15%) drug overdose deaths also involved alcohols. Alcohol involvement in drug overdose deaths may have 
been underestimated. Other analyses on the reporting of alcohol 
involvement on death certi˜cates have shown that alcohol was 
frequently underreported (24,25). 10  
National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 65, No. 10, December 20, 2016Using the literal text 
Currently, data from NVSS are used to quantify the size 
and scope of fatal drug overdoses in the United States and to track national trends (1). NVSS mortality data are an important 
source of information on drug overdose deaths as it has been 

collected using a consistent method over a long period of time. 
In addition, the NVSS mortality data have other strengths, such 
as coverage of all deaths to residents in the United States, 
including those occurring in rural areas or outside of a health 
care setting. Although analysis of the NVSS mortality data have 

provided valuable information on drug overdose deaths, the 
current classi˜cation system, ICDŒ10, is limited in its ability to 

describe the speci˜c drugs involved.  For example, of the top 
10 drugs involved in drug overdose deaths, only heroin (T40.1), 
methadone (T40.3), and cocaine (T40.5) have separate ICDŒ10 

codes.This report demonstrates the utility of supplementing the ICDŒ10-coded data in NVSS with information on the speci˜c 
drugs involved in deaths using information from the death 
certi˜cate literal text. All of the data in the NVSS mortality ˜les 
are based solely on information captured on the death certi˜cate. 

The cause-of-death information is coded according to ICDŒ10 
(5). Historically, the ICDŒ10 codes are used to classify the drugs 

and chemicals involved in the deaths. In this study, the speci˜c 

drugs involved were extracted from the death certi˜cate literal 
text using a new method (14).  Using this new method, it is possible to identify the speci˜c drugs involved in drug overdose deaths, which is an 
enhancement to the traditional method of identifying drugs 
using broad ICDŒ10 drug categories. Most importantly, the 

new method allows for the identi˜cation of drugs that are not 
identi˜ed separately in ICDŒ10. For example, from 2010 through 
2014, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine were among 
the top 10 drugs involved in drug overdose deaths, but all were 
classi˜ed to Natural and semi-synthetic opioid analgesic  (T40.2) 
in ICDŒ10 (26).Data from the literal text could potentially be used to detect 
emerging trends. For instance, the methods could be modi˜ed to 
identify deaths involving newly approved prescription drugs and 
new substances of abuse. In order to detect emerging trends, 

periodically updating the text search capabilities is critical. 
Data quality and other study limitations
The ˜ndings in this report must be interpreted with the 
potential variation in death investigation and reporting practices 
in mind. In most instances, drug overdose deaths are investigated 
and certi˜ed by a medical examiner or coroner, as these deaths 

are generally sudden and unexpected (27), and more than three-
quarters occur outside of a health care setting (28). Medical 
examiners and coroners use forensic autopsy, toxicological 

tests, death scene information, medical history, as well as other 

ancillary tests and reports to determine the cause of death as 

well as the drugs involved (9,29). While there are recommendations on methods for investigation 
and certi˜cation of drug-related deaths (8,9), variation in death 
investigation practice and reporting may occur and impact the 
measurement of overdose death rates overall as well as rates 
involving speci˜c drugs. For instance, at autopsy, toxicological 

tests may or may not be performed to determine the type of 

drugs present. The substances tested for, and the circumstances 

under which the tests are performed, may vary by jurisdiction, 

decedent, and over time.Toxicology plays an important role in the detection of 
speci˜c drugs; however, interpretation of toxicology results for 
 drug-related deaths is not straightforward. The interpretation 
depends on what tests were ordered, characteristics of the causative agents, characteristics of metabolites, and other 
information gathered during the investigation and examination.While there are standard panels of assays to test for drugs, not all drugs are covered by these panels, and speci˜c tests 
must be ordered during the death investigation 
(9). In addition, as exempli˜ed by the recent increase in deaths involving 

fentanyl analogs, these panels must be kept up to date with the 
latest pro˜les (30). The ˜ndings from toxicological tests and 
death scene investigation are not always able to distinguish 

subtle differences in the possible causative agents in drug 
overdose deaths. For example, the synthetic opioid fentanyl is 

manufactured both for pharmaceutical purposes and also illicitly, 

and it is not always possible to distinguish postmortem whether 
the drug was manufactured pharmaceutically or illicitly (31).  Some drugs have the same metabolites or are metabolites of 
other drugs, potentially resulting in misattribution of the speci˜c 
drugs involved in death. For example, in this report, mentions 

of morphine may actually refer to heroin, because morphine is 
a metabolite of heroin (9). In some cases toxicological markers 
are present, such as 6-monacetylemorphine (6-MAM), which 
indicate that the morphine was metabolized from heroin (9). This 
report found 518 concomitant mentions of heroin and morphine 
in 2014, suggesting that the medical examiner or coroner might 
not have been able to determine the speci˜c drug contributing 
to the overdose. 
A review of some of these cases revealed that 
the word ﬁPROBABLEﬂ sometimes appeared before the word 
ﬁHEROIN.ﬂ In this analysis, heroin and morphine were considered 
as mutually exclusive drugs. This could potentially result in 
some underestimation of the number of deaths involving heroin 
and some overestimation of the number of deaths involving 
morphine.  Medical examiners and coroners also take into account 
death scene information when investigating drug overdose 

deaths (9,29). For example, drug paraphernalia may suggest 

illicit use. Multiple pills found in gastric contents could also 

indicate suicidal intention. Drugs found at the scene may also 

give some indication of whether the drugs were taken together 

(e.g., heroin laced with fentanyl) and provide more information 

about the source of the drug, which may be dif˜cult to determine 

based on postmortem toxicological analysis (9).During death investigations, medical examiners and coroners may use medical history, such as prescription history 

obtained from Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) 

(32). However, in many states, medical examiners and coroners 

do not have access to PDMP data (33). Once the medical examiners and coroners have investigated 
the death, they will complete the death certi˜cate. When  National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 65, No. 10, December 20, 2016  
11determining the drugs to report on the death certi˜cate, some medical certi˜ers focus on a single lethal drug rather than listing 
multiple drugs involved in the death. Alternatively, some may 

choose to list a variety of drugs. Sometimes they use vague 

terms such as ﬁPOLYPHARMACYﬂ and ﬁMULTIDRUG.ﬂ    
In other cases, when no drug is speci˜ed, the certi˜er might not know the drugs involved in death. This can occur if 

the decedent is hospitalized for a period of time before death. 
Hospitals retain the blood specimen for a limited time. In 
other cases, there may not be an adequate sample for forensic 
toxicology, as may be the case if the body is not recovered for an 

extended period of time after the death occurred.Conclusions
In summary, this report provides a picture of the most 
frequent drugs involved in drug overdose deaths in the United 
States, and highlights the frequency of deaths involving multiple 
drugs. The report also demonstrates the ability of a new method 
for abstracting data from the death certi˜cate to enhance 
national monitoring of drug overdose deaths, and it emphasizes 

the need to include speci˜c drugs involved in the death on the 
death certi˜cate. References
