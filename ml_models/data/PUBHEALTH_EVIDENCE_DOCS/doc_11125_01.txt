        Citing Articles1 CommentRelated ArticlesAbstract BackgroundThe survival benefit of a strategy of coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) added to guideline-directed medical therapy, as compared with medical therapy alone, in patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure, and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction remains unclear.
 MethodsFrom July 2002 to May 2007, a total of 1212 patients with an ejection fraction of 35% or less and coronary artery disease amenable to CABG were randomly assigned to undergo CABG plus medical therapy (CABG group, 610 patients) or medical therapy alone (medical-therapy group, 602 patients).
 The primary outcome was death from any cause.
 Major secondary outcomes included death from cardiovascular causes and death from any cause or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes.
 The median duration of follow-up, including the current extended-follow-up study, was 9.8 years.
