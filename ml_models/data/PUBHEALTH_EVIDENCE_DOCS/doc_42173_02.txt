 By Beth Dalbey, Patch StaffJun	1, 2018 1:13 pm MTReply    TUCSON, AZ — Investigators in Tucson are looking into a disturbing discovery Tuesday of what members of the Veterans on Patrol group thought was a typical encampment, but may be a holding area for children sold as sex slaves.
 Solar lights at an area near Interstate 19 and Valencia Road caught the attention of the veterans, who scour places where homeless veterans might be as part of their mission to get them off the street.
 Instead, they found trees that had restraints on them, a baby crib and stroller, hair dye, an outdoor bathroom and pornographic material.
 Also at the site was an underground cave about 5 feet tall that had a dresser and crates — large enough for a child to fit inside.
 Subscribe They did not find anyone at the site, but former Navy SEAL Craig Sawyer, who is filming "Contraland," a documentary exploring child sex trafficking, told television station KOLD it looked like someone had been there about 10 days earlier.
 "I didn't expect to see something this heinous and inhumane this close," Sawyer said.
 "I served in the military to keep things like this from happening here that's why I risked my security, so nobody here would have to put up with this."

 "And we are right there and our city is right there, our children are right there and it's not my problem if it's not in my backyard," Lewis Arthur, who was with the group looking for homeless veterans told KOLD.
 "Now it's in our backyard."
 Sawyer told KOLD that as part of his research into the problem of child sex trafficking, he's "heard of rooms full of kids in houses and basements and things like that, but nothing underground like this.
 ""An underground cell, that's pretty creepy," Sawyer said, adding he saw another nearby site where "they are already digging with fresh tools and fresh dirt.
 "Sawyer founded Veterans For Child Rescue in 2017 and has dedicated his life to raising awareness about child sex slavery, rescuing victims and putting child sex traffickers behind bars.
 Working with other veterans and police departments, he uses his military experience to run covert operations across the country, according to the organization's website.
 Tucson police did not immediately comment, but were at the site taking photographs, KOLD reported.

 \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe 12-member panel is expected to include Vivek Murthy, a former surgeon general, David Kessler, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration; and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, a Yale University professor, according to The New York Times and other reports.
 \u0026ldquo;There's still the courts.
 If ever there's ever a time to expose widespread fraud, this is the president to do it.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Biden pledged to \u0026ldquo;end a grim era of demonization\u0026rdquo; and usher in a new era of cooperation in his first remarks Saturday evening as president-elect of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBiden and his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, pushed past the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency earlier in the day, and are projected by The Associated Press and other news organizations to limit President Donald Trump to a single term in the White House.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBiden, who jogged onto the stage in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, wearing a black suit, black face mask and light blue tie, said it is time to \u0026ldquo;lower the temperature\u0026rdquo; in America and unite and heal.
 \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe 2020 election and the years leading up to it have been among the most divisive in history, marked by what Biden called a conscious choice by Democrats and Republicans in Congress not to work with one another.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a decision, it\u0026rsquo;s a choice,\u0026rdquo; said the 77-year-old Biden, known for his skills as a negotiator both as President Barack Obama\u0026rsquo;s vice president for eight years, but also as a U.S. senator.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;If we decide not to cooperate, we can decide to cooperate, and I believe this is a mandate given to us by the American people,\u0026rdquo; he said.
 \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a choice I will make, and I will call on Republicans and Democrats to make that choice with me.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRepeating a theme familiar on the campaign trail, Biden said he will be a president who \u0026ldquo;doesn\u0026rsquo;t see red states or blue states, only sees the United States.\u0026rdquo; He said he would work \u0026ldquo;with all my heart\u0026rdquo; to win the confidence of all Americans.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president,\u0026rdquo; he said.
 Joe Biden had \u0026ldquo;the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exist in our country\u0026rdquo; by selecting a woman as his running mate, Harris said in remarks Saturday in Wilmington, Delaware.

 \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities,\u0026rdquo; she said.
 More than 102 million Americans voted early by mail, and overall turnout of nearly 145 million people shattered previous records.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs the count continues, Biden has earned 74.5 million of those votes, compared to 70.3 million for Trump.
