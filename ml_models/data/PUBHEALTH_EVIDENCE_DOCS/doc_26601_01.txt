 Tony Evers (D) is pushing a red flag law that would allow a judge to issue orders resulting in firearm confiscation.
 WISN reports that Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul (D) is also calling for the confiscatory measure to be put in place.
 Kaul said the law “will allow law enforcement or family members to go to a judge and ensure that somebody who is a threat to themselves or others is temporarily disarmed.”  The NRA opposes the push by claiming it violates the due process rights of Wisconsin residents:  #WISCONSIN: Gov.
 Evers and Attorney General Kaul are already trying to pass gun control that would allow #2A rights to be stripped away without due process.
