Cooperating with Narcotics Anonymous
Although certain traditions guide its relations 
with other organizations, Narcotics Anonymous 
welcomes the cooperation of those in government, 
the clergy, treatment and healthcare professions, 
criminal justice organizations and private voluntary 
organizations. NA™s nonaddict friends have been in
-strumental in getting Narcotics Anonymous started 
in many countries and helping NA grow worldwide.
NA strives to cooperate with others interested in 
Narcotics Anonymous. Our more common coopera
-tion approaches are: providing contact information, 
disseminating recovery literature, and sharing infor
-mation about recovery. Additionally, NA members 
are often available to provide presentations for 
treatment centers and correctional facilities, o˝ering 
information about the NA program to the profes
-sional sta˝ and sharing with addicts otherwise un
-able to attend community-based meetings.
Membership Demographics
To o˝er some general informal observations 
about the nature of the membership, and the e˝ec
-tiveness of the program, the following observations 
are believed to be reasonably accurate.
The socioeconomic strata represented by the NA 
membership vary from country to country. Usually, 
members of one particular social or economic class 
start and sustain most developing NA communities 
worldwide, but as their fellowship development 
activities become more e˝ective, the membership 
becomes more broadly representative of all socio
-economic backgrounds.
All ethnic and religious backgrounds are repre
-sented among NA members. Once a developing 
NA community reaches a certain level of maturity, 
its membership generally re˚ects the diversity or 
homogeneity of the background culture.
Membership in Narcotics Anonymous is vol
-untary; no attendance records are kept either for 
NA™s own purposes or for others. Because of this, 
it is sometimes di˛cult to provide interested par
-ties with comprehensive information about NA 
membership. There are, however, some objective 
measures that can be shared based on data ob
-tained from members attending one of our world 
conventions; the diversity of our membership, espe
-cially ethnic background, seems to be representa
-tive of the geographic location of the survey. The 
following demographic information was gathered 
from a survey completed by approximately 16,750 
NA members. The survey was made available at 
the 2013 World Convention of NA in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania in our international journal, 
The NA 
Way Magazine
, and on our website:
Gender: 57% male, 43% female.
Age: 1% 20 years old and under, 12% 21Œ30 
years old, 18% 31Œ40 years old, 28% 41Œ50 
years old, 31% 51-60 years old, and 10% over 
60 years old.
Ethnicity: 76% Caucasian, 13% African-
American, 5% Hispanic, and 6% other. 
Employment status: 59% employed full-time, 
12% employed part-time, 11% unemployed, 
9% retired, 6% students, and 4% homemakers.
Years Drug-Free
NA members have an average of 11.07 years 
clean. This can be compared to NA™s last survey, 
which was the 2011 Membership Survey
, showed 
members with an average of 10.87 years clean. 
Quality of Life Improvement Areas
Multiple answers were allowed.
In 2013 the two areas that received overwhelm
-ing improvement with NA attendance were family 
relationship, where 92% of our members stated en
-richment; and social connection, which was realized 
by 88% of the respondents. NA literature states that 
active addiction is marked by increased isolation 
and destruction with relationships. Recovery in NA 
has helped survey respondents to repair the dam
-age in their lives from drug addiction.
