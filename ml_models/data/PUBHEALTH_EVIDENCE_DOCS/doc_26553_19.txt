protective equipment and 
emergency procedures
 
 
Use personal protective equipment.
 
Follow safe handling advice and personal protective 
equipment recommendations.
 
 
Environmental precautions
 
 
:
 
Discharge into the environment must be avoided.
 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so.
 
Prevent spreading over a wide area (e.g. by containment or oil 
barriers).
 
Retain and dispose of contaminated wash water.
 
Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages 
cannot be contained.
 
 
Methods and materials for 
containment and cleaning up
 
 
:
 
Non
-
sparking tools should be used.
 
Soak up with inert absorbent material.
 
Suppress (knock down) gases/vapors/mists with a water spray 
jet.
 
For large spills, provide diking or other appropriate 
co
ntainment to keep material from spreading. If diked material 
can be pumped, store recovered material in appropriate 
container.
 
Clean up remaining materials from spill with suitable 
absorbent.
 
Local or national regulations may apply to releases and 
disposal
 
of this material, as well as those materials and items 
employed in the cleanup of releases. You will need to 
determine which regulations are applicable.

Personal protective equipment
 
Respiratory protection
 
 
:
 
General and local exhaust ventilation is recommended to 
maintain vapor exposures below recommended limits. Where 
concentrations are above recommended limits or are 
unknown, appropriate respiratory protection should be worn. 
Follow OSHA respirator regulatio
ns (29 CFR 1910.134) and 
use NIOSH/MSHA approved respirators. Protection provided 
by air purifying respirators against exposure to any 
hazardous chemical is limited. Use a positive pressure air 
supplied respirator if there is any potential for uncontrolled
 
release, exposure levels are unknown, or any other 
circumstance where air purifying respirators may not provide 
adequate protection.
 
 
Hand protection
 
    
Material
 
:
 
Impervious gloves
 
 
    
Material
 
:
 
Flame retardant gloves
 
 
 
    
Remarks
 
 
:
 
Choose gloves to protect hands against chemicals depending 
on the concentration specific to place of work.
 
Breakthrough 
time is not determined for the product. Change gloves often!
 
For special applications, we recommend clarifying the 
resistance to chemica
ls of the aforementioned protective 
gloves with the glove manufacturer.
 
Wash hands before 
breaks and at the end of workday.
 
 
 
Eye protection
 
 
:
 
Wear the following personal protective equipment:
 
Safety goggles
 
 
Skin and body protection
 
 
:
 
Select appropriate protective clothing based on chemical 
resistance data and an assessment of the local exposure 
potential.
 
Wear the following personal protective equipment:
 
Flame retardant antistatic protective clothing.
 
Skin contact must be avoided by using impervious protective 
clothing (gloves, aprons, boots, etc).
 
 
Hygiene measures
 
 
:
 
Ensure that eye flushing systems and safety showers are 
located close to the working place.
 
When using do not eat, drink or smoke.
 
W
ash contaminated clothing before re
-
use.
