     Introduction 
In 2007, the Department of Veterans Affairs began an intensive effort to reduce suicide among 
Veterans. This effort had its roots in the Mental Health staffing expansion and the Joshu
a Omvig Bill, and it included both attention to Veterans in crisis as well as those determined to 

be at high risk for suicide. The effort also included the development of data systems to 

increase understanding of suicide among Veterans and inform both the VA and other suicide 

prevention programs. Information on the characteristics and outcomes of Veterans at risk for 
suicide is critical to the development of improved suicide prevention programs. 
In 2008, 

system based on reports of suicide and suicide events (i.e. non-fatal attempts, serious suicide 
ideation, suicide plan) submitted by Suicide Prevention Coordinators located at each VA 

Medical Center and large outpatient facility. In addition to information obtained from suicide 
behavior reports, data on the characteristics and outcomes of callers to the national toll-free 
Veterans Crisis Line 
a universally available crisis intervention resource 
are available. In 
2010, the VA also began an intensive effort to shorten delays associated with access to NDI 

data and increase understanding of suicide among all Veterans by developing data sharing 

agreements with all 50 U.S. states. The integration of information collected through the NDI, 



electronic medical records contribute to an increased understanding of suicide and risk 
management by identifying gaps in existing knowledge, opportunities for intervention and the 
impact of VA-sponsored suicide prevention programs. 
7    
         
     
              
    
    
   All of these data collection systems have matured to the point where they can now begin to 
provide VA with information that can be used to both determine if the current suicide 
prevention program is having an effect, where gaps may occur, and provide direction for the 

future. This reports is an initial attempt to look at all of this information together in orde
r to provide an overall picture of Veteran suicide to drive suicide prevention program development 

and improve outcomes for Veterans at risk for suicide. It is expected that reporting will be 

refined as time goes on and more data become available. This report contains a systematic 

overview of data obtained from the State Mortality Project, Suicide Behavior Reports for fiscal 
years 2009 
2012, and Veterans Crisis Line.

  State Mortality Data Project 
Up to this point the primary source for Veteran suicide information has been limited to those 
Veterans who receive care in VA. Information on the rate and characteristics of suicide among 

those who used VHA services is available for the fiscal years 2001
2009 based on 
information from analyses of mortality data obtained through the National Death Index. Using 

this information we have identified a decrease in the age-adjusted rate of suicide (per 100,000 

person years) between the fiscal years 2001
--2003 and relative stability in suicide rates during 
recent years (Figure 1). 
While data obtained from NDI provide a reliable mechanism for identifying suicides among 

some Veterans, these data often encounter lengthy delays and require a population list to 

identify cause of death information. The Department of Veterans Affairs believes that a 

comprehensive suicide prevention program requires timely and accurate information beyond 

that acquired from its internal patient population. 
9    
     
   
     
       
  
       
   
  
       
       
     
    
   
      It was determined that additional data on Veterans with and without history of VHA service 
use, among those who have accessed crisis services, and for those with report of non-fatal 
suicide events are needed to overcome delays associated in acquisition of mortality data, 

improve understanding of suicide among all Veterans, and identify changes in outcomes 

among those who use receive care from the VHA. The need for comprehensive information led 

to the decision to seek support from state governments for a collaborative effort to improve 

current understanding of suicide among Veterans among Veterans with and without history of 

VHA service use. In 2010, Secretary Shinseki engaged Governors of all U.S. states requesting 
support and collaboration to improve the timeliness and utility of suicide mortality reporting. 

h state to designate a point of contact who would work with 
the VISN 2 Center of Excellence for Suicide Prevention to develop data use agreements for 

the purpose of sharing identified mortality data for all known suicides. The time frame for the 

original request for data included all known suicides reported between January 1, 1999 and 

December 31, 2004. However, following discussion of developing program needs, the time 
frame was extended for each data request including existing and pending data use 
agreements that share individually identifiable data through December 31, 2015. Data obtained 

from states is currently being used to assess the reliability and validity of Veteran information 

collected during mortality reporting, fulfill requirements of PL111.163 to determine the number 

of Veterans who have died from suicide (1999-2009), and to identify opportunities to improve 

the timeliness and utility of suicide reporting. Currently, all 50 U.S. states include some 

military service. A complete listing of Veteran 
identifiers by state and project year has been provided as Appendix A.

       Project Cost 
The cumulative cost of the State Mortality Data Project has been $46,771.29 as of 11/16/2012
; including FY12 expenditures of $35,094.23 and FY13 expenditures of $11,677.06. All costs 
associated with the State Mortality Data Project are related to state fees for processing and 
delivery of mortality data. 
Project Status 
As of November 2012, data have been received from 
34 states and data use agreements have 
been approved by an additional eight states. Data will be received from these states once the 
terms of individual data use and financial arrangements are finalized.  An additional 11 states 

and territories have not made a decision regarding our request or are in the process of 
developing Data Use Agreements for VA review. A total of five states and territories have 

requested modifications to the initial request for data sharing or have been unable to identify 

an internal point of contact to support this program. Efforts to address initial concerns and/or 

identify appropriate contacts within non-participating areas are ongoing. While the State 
Mortality Project has not finalized contributions from all states, evaluation of existing data 
determined that the pilot effort has reached a point of statistical significance allowing for 

analysis of available data. Availability of data by state is listed in Table 1 and an estimated 

schedule for updates to the existing data has been provided as Appendix B.  Recently, efforts 

to obtain information on deaths from suicide for Veterans have expanded to several U.S. 

territories including Guam, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Commonwealth of Northern 
Mariana Islands, and American Samoa as well as the Philippines, due to the presence of a VA 
facility 
and a large population of US Military Veterans in these regions. The Department of 
State has also been approached about obtaining information on suicide deaths among 
Americans living in foreign territories. Data availability and the status of each data request are 
11    
     
  
  
      
              summarized in Table 1. To date, data from twenty-one (21) states have been cleaned and 
entered into a single integrated file containing information on more than 147,000 suicides and 
27,062 reported Veterans. 
In addition to the issues identified above, barriers to full project implementation include 
inconsistent availability of requested information in all states
, barriers to providing non-resident 
data and sending preference to provide 
de-identified data due to conflicting interpretations of 
Social Security laws. Negotiations with states are continuing as we begin requesting more 

ing or revising previously completed Data Use Agreements.

  Reliability and Validity of Veteran Identifiers 
A previous assessment of Veteran identifiers on Colorado death certificates suggested that the 
reliability of Veteran identifiers on state death certificates is acceptable.(1) The state mortality 
project offers a unique opportunity to more directly quantify the misclassification of Veteran 

status as indicated on death certificates for suicide. A preliminary assessment of data collected 

from 
Washington State (Washington initially provided data from 1999-2008) 
as part of this 
project supports conclusions of acceptable reliability reported in previous assessments and 
demonstrates the utility of using VA administrative data for confirming service history. 
Comparing the death certificate indicator in Washington to VA and DOD records, 5% 
misclassification was observed overall, suggesting that death certificate reporting is a 
reasonable indicator of Veteran status among suicide deaths that could be used to track the 

overall rate of Veteran suicides.  However, misclassification was considerably higher among 

validated Veterans with 11% of true Veterans classified as non-Veterans on the death 
certificate. Only 2% of true non-Veterans were misclassified as Veterans on the death 
certificate. The ability of death certificates to fully capture female Veterans was particularly low; 

only 67% of true female Veterans were identified. Younger or unmarried Veterans and those 

with lower levels of education were also more likely to be missed on the death certificate.  This 

decreased sensitivity in specific subgroups can affect both suicide surveillance and research 

efforts that utilize Veteran status on the death certificate. From a surveillance standpoint, the 
rate of Veteran suicides will be underestimated in these groups. From a research standpoint, 
the generalizability of study findings for specific subgroups may be limited. This preliminary 

analysis demonstrates the value of linking information from state mortality record obtained 
through data sharing agreements and VA and DoD administrative files. 
Main Finding: Continued research on the reliability and validity of Veteran identifiers is needed.

 Limitations of Existing Data 
Currently available data include information on suicide mortality among the population of 
residents in 21 states. Veteran status in each of these areas is determined by a single question 

asking about history of U.S. military service. Information about history of military service is 

routinely obtained from family members and collected by funeral home staff and has not be
en validated using information from the DoD or 
VA. Further, Veteran status was not collected by 
each state during each year of the project period. Appendix B provides a listing of the 
availability of Veteran identifiers by state and year. 
Further, this report contains information from the first 21 states to contribute data for this 
project and does not include some states, such as California and Texas, with larger Veteran 

populations. Information from these states has been received and will be included in future 
reports. 
Suicide among Veterans 
As Reported on Death Certificates 
Of the 147,763 suicides reported in 21 states, 27,062 (18.3%) were identified as having history 
of U.S. military service on death certificates. However, Veteran status was unknown or not 

reported for more than 23% (n=34,027) of all suicides during the project period. Without 

linking to 
VA or DoD resources to validate history of U.S. military service, it is necessary to 
remove those without information on history of military service from estimates of Veteran 
status among suicide decedents. Among cases where history of U.S. military service was 
reported, Veterans comprised approximately 22.2% of all suicides reported during the project 

period. If this prevalence estimate 
is assumed to be constant across all U.S. states, an 
estimated 22 Veterans will have died from suicide each day in the calendar year 2010. As 
15    
     
  
     
    
       
                   
       
  
    
  
         
       
  Veteran status on death certificates is verified in on-going work the overall percentage remains 
comparable. As shown in Appendix C, preliminary data for the 2012 calendar year will be 
available from a limited number of participating states within the next 12 months. It is important 

to note that estimates of the number of Veterans who died from suicide are based on 

information reported on state death certificates and may be subject to reporting error. It is 

recommended that the estimated number of Veterans be interpreted with caution due to the 

use of data from a sample of states and existing evidence of uncertainty in Veteran identifiers 

on U.S. death certificates. 
It is important to note that 
both 
Veteran populations and those who 
die by suicide are significantly more likely to be male
. According to data provided by the United 
States Census Bureau, 93% of all Veterans are male and 21% of all males aged 18 years and 

older have history of U.S. military service. Further, history of U.S. military service increases 

with age, with the highest percentage of Veterans aged 55 years and older.(2) Information 

reported on state death certificates indicates that the ages 50-59 years is also an important 

group for addressing risk for suicide. Between 1999 and 2010 the average age of male 
Veterans who died from suicide was 59.6 years among Veterans identified on state death 
certificates and 54.5 years among those who could be validated using VA administrative 

records. The average age of male Veterans who died from suicide was considerably older 

than the average age of male suicide decedents who were not identified as Veterans (43.1 

years).  For example, according to data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and 

Prevention (2010), approximately 79% of all suicides among adults aged 18 years and older 
were male and approximately 44% of all male suicides were among those aged 50 years of 
age and older
. (3) It is therefore possible that epidemiologic characteristic of suicide in the 
general population (i.e. higher rates of suicide among older adult males) may contribute to a 
comparatively high prevalence of Veterans among those who die from suicide.

Main Finding: While the percentage of all suicides reported as Veteran has decreased, the number of 
suicides has increased. 
As shown in Figure 2, the percentage of all suicides identified as Veteran declined between the 
years 1999-2003 and has remained comparatively constant over recent years
. However, the 
number of deaths by suicide has increased. Between 2007 and 2010, the number of deaths 
from suicide in the U.S. increased by nearly 11% and the rate of suicide increased by over 8%.

Estimates that the number of suicides among Veterans each day has increased, are based on 
information provided by 21 states and may not be generalizable to the larger Veteran 
population. To account for uncertainty in the estimated number of Veterans who have died 
from suicide each year, confidence intervals were calculated using variability in the percentage 

of Veterans reported among all suicides in participating states. Information on the estimated 
count and lower and upper limits for the estimate for each year has been provided in Table 2.

          The estimated number of Veterans who died from suicide each day was calculated as the 
percentage of all suicides identified as Veterans multiplied by the number of suicides in the 
U.S. 
and divided by the number of days in a year. The estimated number of Veterans who 

have died from suicide is based on data obtained from 21 states and has been calculated 

using service history as reported on death certificates. An assessment of Veteran status on 

Washington State death certificates identified a measureable amount of error among those 

with history of U.S. military service. Therefore, estimates of the number of Veterans who have 

died from suicide each day based on proxy report of history of U.S. military service should be 
interpreted with caution.. 
It is also possible to estimate the excess burden of suicide among Veterans by comparing the 
percentages of Veterans in the general population and the percentage of Veterans among 

those who have died from suicide. Figures 4 & 5 show the percentage of Veterans living in the 
first 21 states to contribute to this project and the estimated prevalence of Veterans among 
suicide decedents in those same areas for males and females respectively. As shown in 

Figures 4 & 5, difference in the population percentage of male Veterans in 21 participating 

states and the percentage of Veterans among males who died from suicide in those same 

areas is highest among younger Veterans and decreases with age. However, the difference 

between the population percentage of female Veterans and female Veterans who died from 

suicide in those same areas is greater than it is for males and does not decrease with age. 
(Please note that these two Figures use different scales. The two populations are very 
different in regards to numbers and different scales are needed to demonstrate the differences 
in each.)

An important assumption underlying current estimates of the number of Veteran suicides in the 
total population is stability in the percentage of Veterans among suicides reported in each 
20    
    
  
     
     
           
     
         
   state. As shown Figur
e 6, there is variability in this percentage of Veterans among all suicides 
across states during the project period; with the percentage of Veteran suicides ranging from a 
low of just over 7% to more than 26% of all suicides
. Available data prevent any firm 
conclusions about correlates or causes of difference in the prevalence of Veteran suicides in 

each area. However, the observed variability in the percentage of all suicides reported as 

Veteran across states suggests that this number is not constant across areas. It is possible 

that differences in demographic composition and service availability contribute to variability in 

Veteran suicide across geographic regions. Additional study of the causes and correlates of 
variability in Veteran suicide across communities is recommended.

Veteran Status and Demographic Characteristics among Suicide Decedents 
Table 
3 shows the percentage of suicides across 10-year age groups for all Veterans, 
Veterans with history of VHA service use, and those without report of military service (non-
Veterans). As shown in Table 3, those identified as Veterans of U.S. military service were 
more likely to be aged 50 years and older than those without report of military service.

 Specifically, more than 69% of all Veteran suicides were among those aged 50 years and 
older, compared to approximately 37% among those who were not identified as Veterans. The 
final two columns in Table 
3 list the Chi-Square values and p-statistics comparing the age 
distributions of non-Veterans, Veterans, and Veterans with history of VHA service use in the 

year before their death. These comparisons suggest that those identified as Veterans were 

significantly more likely to be age 50 years and older when compared to those without 

indication of military service. Further, those with history of VHA service use were more likely 
than other Veterans to be between the ages of 50 
79 years.

Main Finding: More than 69% of Veteran suicides are among those age 50 years and older. 
There is evidence of differences in gender composition among Veterans who have died from 
suicide when compared to those without history of military service. Specifically, males 

accounted for more than 97% of all suicides among those identified as Veterans, compared to 

approximately 74% among 
non-Veteran suicide decedents (Table 4)

     distribution of age between males with and without report of military service are consistent with 
trends identified in the larger population of suicide decedents. 
As shown in Table 5, females accounted for less than 3% of all suicides among reported 
Veterans, compared to more than 26% among suicide decedents without 
a reported history of 
military service. Overall, there were few differences in the age distribution of suicide decedents 

with and without report of military service.

Additional information available from mortality records may help identify systematic differences 

among suicide decedents who were and were not identified as Veterans. Tables 6

results from comparisons of non-Veterans, Veterans, and Veterans with history of VHA service 
use by marital status, race ethnicity, and educational attainment. Results from these 
comparisons are consistent with previous analyses of the characteristics of Veteran groups.

Suicide Prevention Applications Network/Suicide Behavior Reports 
The VHA Strategic Plan for Suicide Prevention is grounded in a public health framework 
encompassing three major components: surveillance, identification of risk and protective 
factors, and development of effective prevention interventions. In accordance with the first 

component of this plan, surveillance, the VA has mandated since 2008 that health system 

facilities track attempted and completed suicides in a national database, the Suicide 

Prevention and Application Network (SPAN).  Together, SPAN and the Department of 

he same standardized 

-time suicide surveillance systems. 
SPAN is coordinated and maintained by the Mental Health Program Director, Suicide 
Prevention and Community Engagement. The SPAN database compiles individual-level case 

reports for all suicide events and deaths known to VHA providers and Suicide Prevention 

Coordinators from each VHA medical facility using standard processes and a Suicide Behavior 
Report developed by national-level management and suicide prevention experts. VA policy 
requires that Suicide Prevention Coordinators complete a Suicide Behavior Report for all 

known suicides, suicide attempts, and some serious suicide ideation (i.e. suicide ideation 

involving a firearm).  Therefore, reports of non-fatal suicide events may include suicide, suicide 

attempts and serious suicide ideation resulting in preventive action. In 2010, electronic 
reporting of suicide events was implemented. 
The SPAN database provides the capacity for ongoing surveillance of suicide events among 
Veterans. Each month in FY2012, SPAN received approximately 1,400 suicide events 

nationwide, 95% of which are for non-fatal events. Although SPAN contains approximately 
40% of suicide deaths among Veterans receiving VHA services, the State Mortality Data 
Project and annual all-cause National Death Index searches conducted for VHA users are 
26    
      
       
             
   
better suited for tracking suicide deaths in the Veteran population.  In contrast, SPAN is 
uniquely suited to capture information on the incidence and characteristics of non-fatal events. 
Furthermore, because SPAN is an internal data collection system, the SPAN system primarily 

contains suicide events for VHA utilizing Veterans; each year less than 10% of non-fatal 

suicide events reported to SPAN are for Veterans who are not recent VHA users.  (VHA 

usually does not know about events for non-users).This report therefore focuses on non-fatal 

suicide events for VHA users defined as Veterans who have utilized any VHA services within 

one year preceding the event. 
Prevalence and Characteristics of Non-Fatal Suicide Events 
Figure 7
: Number of Reported Suicide Events by Fiscal Year 
As shown in Figure 7, the absolute number of monthly 
non-fatal suicide events has increased 
since SPAN was implemented in 2008. However, early increases were likely due to a

 transitional period during which facilities were adapting to this new program and reporting 
procedures. The second period of the observed increase between December 2009 to July 
2010 is likely due, in a large part, to the initiation of electronic submission of Suicide Behavior 

Reports, which streamlined the reporting process and potentially increased program 

compliance. There also appears to be a seasonal trend with more suicide events in the spring 

and summer months noted in 2010 and 2011. In the fall of 2011, the number of reported 

events again began to decrease, but the expected seasonal increase for the spring of 2012 

was not observed. Thus, although findings are preliminary at this time, the number of non-fatal 
events appears to be decreasing. This observed decrease may represent a true decline in 
Veteran suicide behaviors, but could also be due, in part, to reporting lag or systematic policy 

changes regarding the types and number of events reported. This decrease is also observed 

when considering overall annual trends (Figure 8). In 2012, non-fatal suicide events were 

reported for almost 11,000 VHA users. As some VHA utilizing Veterans experience multiple 

reported events, this corresponds to nearly 15,000 suicide suicide events reported in FY2012 
compared to more than 16,000 in FY2011. This is unique data and cannot be compared to 
non-veteran data since population level non-fatal event data on the general population does 
not exist.

 Figure 8
: Number of Reported Suicide Events and VHA Users by Fiscal Year 
Main finding:  Preliminary evidence suggests that the number of non-fatal suicide event
s for VHA utilizing 
Veterans has been decreasing since September, 2011. 
Considering unique individuals with one or more non-fatal suicide events(s), the suicide event 
rate increased slightly from 2009 to 2011 and decreased slightly in 2012 parallel to that 

observed for the absolute number of events in figures 9 and 10
. As shown in Figure 9
, clear 
gender differences are apparent with more females than males with report of a suicide event 

each year, yet the annual trends are the same for both genders. Furthermore, the gender gap 
appears to be closing.

  Figure 9
: Rate of Non-Fatal Suicide Events by Sex and Fiscal Year 
Main Finding: Although gender differences exist, they appear to be decreasing. 
Age-specific event rates clearly differ with a consistent patern emerging for 2009-2012. Rates 
are highest among younger Veterans and appear to decrease consistently with increasing age. 

Suicide event rates for Veterans 60 and older have remained comparatively stable since 2009, 

but fluctuations have been observed for younger Veterans. When considering rates by age 
group, we again see an increase from 2009-2010 for those less than 60 years of age, but a 
clear decline is noted beginning in 2011 and continuing in 2012. When considering Veterans of 
all ages, this decline was not apparent until 2012. This trend may be due to the fact that 
although rates are lower among older Veterans, there is a larger number of older Veterans 

utilizing VHA services and this group. Therefore, patterns in suicide event reports among older 

adults may disproportionately influence obseved trends in overall frequencies and suicide 
event rates. Among the older Veterans, no change in suicide event rates was observed 
between 2010 and 2011. Non-fatal event rates by age group and gender have been provided 
as Appendix C.

Main Finding: The 12 month 
re-event prevalence decreased in FY2012
. Repeat report of an addiitonal suicide event within 12 months of a 
non-fatal sucide event 
occurs in approximately 15% of cases for both males and females. Although we cannot yet 
report on 2012 reattempt rates, it does appear that the 12 month repeat report prevalence 

decreased slightly from 2010 to 2011. Repeat report prevalence by age group and gender 

have been provided in Appendix D.

Figure 12
: Prevalence of Non-Fatal Events by Time since Last Service Use 
Main Finding: Among those at risk, the first four weeks following service require intensive monitoring 
and case management. 
Figure 12 clearly demonstrates that the majority (80%) of non-fatal events occur within four 
weeks of recieving VHA services. An additional 10% of events occur in the second month 

following last VHA service visit. These findings have important implications for treatment and 

prevention efforts as the majority of those with report of a suicide event are active, recent VHA 
users. 
Furthermore, nearly 50% of the individuals with a VHA service visit in the year preeceeding th
e suicide event were last seen in the outpatient primary care setting (Figure 
13). This implies that 
primary care should be an integral component of VHA suicide prevention programs and 
primary care clinicians should continue to receive support and training on the identification and 
management of those experiencing distress. Another 40% of those with report of one or more 
32    
                  
  
    
  
   
    
  
  
   
       suicide events were last seen for mental health services indicating a need for continued 
assessment and risk management following use of VHA services among those with known risk 
factors (i.e. mental health diagnosis). 
Figure 13
: Prevalence of Last Point of Care Prior to a Non-Fatal Event 
Main Finding: The majority of Veterans who have a suicide event were last seen in an outpatient setting. 
The majority of nonfatal events were the result of an overdose or intentional poisoning. 
However, nearly 11% of non-fatal attempts were made with a firearm. Additional research on 
the characteristics and outcomes among this group is needed. However, it is important to note 
that this number may include both Veterans who held a loaded gun but never discharged the 

firearm and those who suffered a non-fatal injury
.  Given the high case-fatality for firearm 
events in general, this finding highlights an opportunity and need to understand more about 
this group including risk factors, future suicide event rates and re-attempt methods in order to 
direct effective prevention and treatment services.

Veterans Crisis Line 
The Veteran Crisis Line application collects information related to calls from Veterans, their 
families and their friends in need. Calls are mainly received from callers to the National 

Lifeline (1-800-273-

The Veteran 
Crisis Line is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by trained Veteran Affairs employees with 

backgrounds in mental health services
. The information collected during each call includes 
date and time of call, history of suicidal ideation and events, access to means, substance use, 
social support, and perceived intent of suicide event. The majority of information is based on 
the flow of the call, and the number of mandatory fields is kept at a minimum. Most callers are 

anonymous (i.e. they do not provide identifying information) 
and do not result in a 
rescue. Information on outcome of the call and referrals for VHA services are collected and, 
34    
        
  
    
  
   
   
  
   
    
   when available, can be used to identify outcomes among callers to the Veterans Crisis Line 
(VCL). 
Prevalence and Characteristics of Calls to the Veterans Crisis Line 

Since 2009, calls to the Veterans Crisis Line have continued to increase with a noticeable 
spike in call volume beginning in or around May 
2011 (Figure 15). Around this same time, the 
VA re-


to Veterans and their family and friends. The evaluation of this campaign highlights this type of 
messaging as a viable method to encourage help seeking and promote the use of VA mental 
health services to Veteran populations. However, in order to support and sustain help seeking 
behaviors and maintain an upward trend in call volume the continuation of messaging activities 
should be considered. 
Figure 15: VCL Calls by Month 
Main Finding: Calls to the Veterans Crisis Line continue to increase and this increase may be associated 
with efforts to enhance awareness of VHA services through public education campaigns. 
35    
        
  
  
    
                       
The percentage of repeat callers (i.e., callers from a single phone number or who have 
received a referral/rescue within 30 days of another call) has consistently increased over the 

past four years. For some, the Veterans Crisis Line may be instrumental in providing support 
and care and prompt individuals to access it more than once. As shown in Figure 
16 below, the 
percentage of repeat callers has steadily increased over time from 17.25% in FY 2009 to 
almost 19.6% reported in FY 2012. These numbers may reflect change in the type of help 

individuals are seeking (e.g. rather than calling in crisis, calls may be for help with symptoms 
such as insomnia) or are indicative of the expansive role the Veterans Crisis Line may play in 
the provision of care to Veterans. 
Figure 16: Percentage of Repeat Callers by Year 
Females accounted for approximately 20% of calls each month (Figure 17), however, the 
majority of callers to the Veterans Crisis Line were male (almost 80% per month). Despite 
identification as a group less willing to seek psychological help, males more often connected t
o the Veterans Crisis Line, a trend that was relatively stable between 2009 and 2012. 
36    
     
          
 Figure 17: Percentage of Callers by Sex and Month 
Main Finding: The majority of all callers to the Veterans Crisis Line are male. 
Figure 18: Percentage of Callers by 
Age Group and Month 
Main Finding: The majority of callers to the Veterans Crisis Line are between the ages of 50-59. 
37    
        
   
                      
  
      Although people of all ages utilize the Veterans Crisis Line, the largest percentage of calls 
each month to the Veterans Crisis Line were made by individuals between the ages 
50-59 years old (approximately 30% of all calls each month). Rates of suicide among middle-age 
men in the general population have increased during the past three years. Therefore, use of 

the Veterans Crisis Line may be particularly important for members of this group. As shown in 

Figure 18
, the comparatively high prevalence of callers between the ages 50-59 years was 
sustained over time and suggests that the Veterans Crisis Line may provide a resource and 

access to care for those belonging to high-risk subgroups of the larger population. Overall, the 
percentage of calls to the Veterans Crisis Line from adults aged 40 years and younger and 60
-69 years is similar, with a comparatively small percentage (less than 10%) of calls among 
those aged 
70 years and older. 
Figure 19: Percentage of Callers 
by Age Group, Gender, and Month 
Main Finding: Age composition of callers to the VCL is distinct between genders. 
38    
    

    
              
     
        
 Further analysis of monthly calls made to the Veterans Crisis Line reveal that the composition 

ages of 50-59 with the fewest calls made by those ages 70 and older. However, among female 

callers, the pattern is less distinct as trends in calls to the crisis line fluctuate over time with 

several age groups making the majority of calls (primarily those 59 and younger), and older 
females (70 and older) contributing less than 10% to calls per month. 
A majority of all callers to the Veterans Crisis Line identified as Veterans (Figure 20). Overall, 
approximately 80% of all callers to the Veterans Crisis Line identify as Veterans and the 
remainder of other callers (including friends, family members, and all non-military others) 
contributed to less than 20% of total call volume each year. 
Figure 20
: Relationship to Caller by Month 
Main Finding: Approximately 80% of callers to the Veterans Crisis Line identify as Veterans.

 The percentage of Veteran callers to the Veterans Crisis Line has remained comparatively 
constant since the first quarter of 2010. The sudden rise in Veteran callers from 60% in early 
2009 to more than 80% in February 2010 may be attributable to a rebranding of the Veterans 

Crisis Line and the introduction of the Military Crisis Line in FY2011. While the Veterans Crisis 

Line is identified to active duty personnel as the Military Crisis Line, the percentage of active 

duty callers has remained constant since February 2009 at just over 1%. It is possible that 
some active duty personnel may be identifying themselves as Veterans. 
The percentage of repeat callers to the VCL has largely been relatively consistent across the 
past four fiscal years. (Figure 
21) However, a notable drop in the percentage of repeat callers 
is observable in early 2009, with the number of repeat callers falling from approximately 19% 

to 13%. Since then, the percentage of repeat callers has continued to steadily increase back to 
approximately 19%, where is has remained fairly constant since the second quarter of 2011.

         Figure 
21: Percentage of Repeat Callers by Month 
Main Finding: Approximately 19% of calls to the Veterans Crisis Line call more than once each month. 
Based on the prevalence of callers reporting thoughts of suicide at the time of the call, there 
currently seems to be a slight downward trend in the percentage of callers thinking of suicide 
(Figure 
22). A sharp drop was first noted in early 2009, where this number fell from more than 
40% to approximately 30%. However, it is possible that this decrease was associated with 

implementation of the Veterans Crisis Line and characteristics of early adopters of this service. 

This drop was then followed by a steady increase which peaked in the third quarter of 2010 at 

approximately 35%. This number has again decreased, with the percentage of callers thinking 
of suicide presently approximating to the same prevalence observed in 2009. Research is 
recommended to determine possible causes and differences in caller characteristics or 
outcomes associated with this change.

 Figure 
22: Percentage of Callers Thinking about Suicide by Month 
Main Finding: The percentage of callers to the Veterans Crisis Line who are currently thinking of suicide 
has decreased. 
The number and percentage of rescues performed each month has also progressively 
declined (Figure 
23). Following a sharp drop in early 2009, this percentage of all calls resulting 
in a rescue increased to approximately 7% in June 2010 and has consistently decreased, now 

totaling approximately 3% of all calls. This change may be indicative of fewer callers 

presenting with crisis states making them at imminent risk of suicide as well as more callers 
presenting with a greater diversity of problems.

             Figure

Main Finding: The percentage of all calls resulting in a rescue has decreased. 
Figure 
24: Percentage of Callers Receiving a Referral by Month

is increasing.

 The percentage of callers receiving a referral has been steadily increasing from approximately 
31% in early 2009 to more than 40% in FY2012 (Figure 
24). This increase may be due to 
callers to the VCL presenting more distally in the risk continuum or a shift in caller preferences, 
with more callers demonstrating willingness to accept referrals for clinical services. 
Figure 
25: Percentage of Callers Receiving a Referral with Previous VHA Service Use by
Month
Main Finding: Approximately 93% of all Veterans Crisis Line referrals are made to callers with a history of 
VHA service use in the past 12 months. 
The percentage of callers receiving a referral with history of VHA service in the 12 months 
preceding a referral rose from approximately 92.5% in FY2009 to just over 93% in FY2010 

(Figure 
25). This number then slightly dropped in FY2011, only to return to just over 93% in 
FY2012. 
Callers who receive more than one referral in a fiscal year have consistently between FY2009 
FY2012; with approximately 3% of all callers to the Veterans Crisis Line receiving more than 
one referral for care in FY2012 (Figure 
26). 44    
        
     
     
          
      
     Figure 
26: Percentage of Callers with Repeat Referrals by Year 
Main Finding: Slightly more than 3% of callers receive more than one referral each year. 
Figures 
27-29 demonstrate patterns of VHA service use before and following a referral for 
service and are largely consistent across years. Between 61-90 days before the referral
, mental health residential/domiciliary stays averaged 20 days per stay, decreasing to 
approximately 15 days per stay at 0-30 days after a referral. The length of a stay for residential 
and domiciliary care then increases to 22-23 days per stay at 
61-90 days post-referral. In 
contrast, inpatient mental health stays averaged 7-8 days per stay at 
61-90 days before and 
after a referral. Other inpatient stays slightly increased at 90 days following a referral, from 
approximately 5 days in FY2009 to 6-7 days in FY2010-FY2011. Other inpatient stays would 

then decrease to approximately 5 days per stay around the time of the referral, rising to 6-
7 days per stay at 
61-90 days after a referral. Overall, there was an average of 4 outpatient 
mental health encounters between 31-
60 days after a referral, rising to an average of 
5 encounters between 61-90 days following a referral.

Figure 29
: Service Use Before and After Receiving a Referral, FY2011 
Main Finding: Service use continues to increase following a referral for care. 
Patterns of service use among Veterans with history of VHA services that were rescued 
following a call to the Veterans Crisis Line were consistent with increases noted following a 

referral. Overall, mental health residential/domiciliary stays showed little variability between 

FY2010-FY2011, ranging from approximately 20 days per stay at 
61-90 days before the 
rescue to 15 days per stay around the time of the rescue, rising to 21-22 days per stay at 
61-90 days following a rescue (Figures 
30-32). The number of inpatient days and encounters 
varies from FY2009, where these stays rose to 25 days per stay at 1-30 days before a rescue, 
falling to 15 days in the 0-
30 days following a rescue, rising to 20 days per stay at 
61-90 days 
after the event. Between FY2009-FY2011, inpatient mental health stays averaged 8 days per 
stay at 30-90 days before the rescue, rising approximately 25% to about 10 inpatient days 
31-90 days after the rescue. Other inpatient stays averaged 6 days per stay at 31-90 days before 
47    
     
    
   
        and after the rescue in FY2009 and FY2011. In FY2010, other inpatient stays averaged 6 days 
per stay at 
31-90 days before a rescue and rose to an average of 
8 inpatient days between 61
-90 days after a rescue.

  Figure 
32: Service Use Before and After a Rescue, FY2011 
Main finding: Between FY2009 
 FY2011, use of inpatient and outpatient services increased following a 
rescue. 
Callers to the Veterans Crisis Line who receive a referral for follow-up care or who result in a 
rescue represent two groups that may be at increased risk for suicide. Increased risk for repeat 
suicide attempts has been identified among those who survive an initial suicide event and, 
among callers to the Veterans Crisis Line, may be greatest among Veterans who have 

attempted suicide before the time of their first referral or rescue resulting for a call to the 

Veterans Crisis Line. The suicide reattempt prevalence rate in FY2009 was approximately 19, 

increasing to 20 in FY2010, and decreasing to 18 in FY2011. (Figure 
33) This change in 12
-month reattempt prevalence rates may be due to a decrease in the number of non-fatal suicide 
attempters who call the Veterans Crisis Line as well as a sign of effective identification and 
management of risk following a rescue or referral.

     Conclusions 
The report contains prevalence data and characteristics of suicide among Veterans and 
evidence of change in outcomes among Veterans at risk for suicide. Included in this report are 

an overview and analysis of information collected through collaborative data sharing 

agreements with U.S. states, reports of non-fatal suicide events among Veterans using VHA 

services and analysis of data obtained from the Veterans Crisis Line.  Data collected through 


support and development of new prevention programs.  Major findings of the report include: 
While the percentage of all suicides reported as Veterans has decreased, the number of 
suicides has increased 
A majority of Veteran suicides are among those age 50 years and older.  Male Veterans 
who die by suicide are older than non-Veteran males who die by suicide. 
The age distribution of Veteran and non-Veteran women who have died from suicide is 
similar. 
The demographic characteristics of Veterans who have died from suicide are similar 
among those with and without a history of VHA service use. 
Among those at risk, the first 4 weeks following service require intensive monitoring and 
case management (which verifies the importance of the Enhanced Care Package for 
those at high risk). 
There is preliminary evidence in 2012 indicating a decrease in the rate of non-fatal 

suicide events for VHA utilizing Veterans. 
Decreasing rates of non-fatal suicide events are associated with increasing age. 
The data show a decrease in the 12 month re-event prevalence in fiscal year (FY) 2012
. The majority of Veterans who have a suicide event were last seen in an outpatient 
setting.  A high prevalence of non-fatal suicide events result from overdose or other 

intentional poisoning. 
Continued increases in calls to the Veterans Crisis Line may be associated with efforts 

to enhance awareness of VHA services through public education campaigns.

      The majority of callers to the Veterans Crisis Line are male and between the ages of 50
-59. Differences in the age composition of callers to the Veterans Crisis Line are associated
with gender.
A large percentage of callers to the Veterans Crisis Line are identified as Veterans.

Approximately 19 percent of callers to the Veterans Crisis Line call more than once
each month. 
The percentage of callers to the Veterans Crisis Line who are currently thinking of 
suicide has decreased. 
The percentage of all calls resulting in a rescue has decreased, indicating that the calls 
are less emergent and callers are using the Crisis Line earlier.
The percentage of callers receiving a referral for follow-up care is increasing.

Approximately 93 percent of all Veterans Crisis Line referrals are made to callers with a
history of VHA service use in the past 12 months.
Service use continues to increase following a referral for care.
Between FY 2009 
FY 2011, use of inpatient and outpatient services increased
following a rescue. 
The 12 month re-event prevalence has decreased among those who have been 
rescued or received a referral for follow-up care. 
Although this was not a research-based analysis and there are significant limitations in the 
data that are available, as described in the report, this first attempt at a comprehensive review 

of Veteran suicide does provide us with valuable information for future directions in care and 

program development. While the numbers of Veterans who die from suicide each day has 
remained relatively stable over the past 12 years (varying from 18 -22 per day), the percentage 
of people who die by suicide in America who are Veterans has decreased slightly.  At the 

same time, the number of Americans who die by suicide each day has increased. This 
provides preliminary evidence that the programs initiated by VA are improving outcomes.  VA 
52    
          
          
     
  
     
  
     
   
  
    
        must continue to provide a high level of care, and recognize that there is still much more work 
to do. As long as Veterans die by suicide, we must continue to improve and provide even 
better services and care. This report provides us with valuable information about opportunities 

to do even better work.  
A taskforce designed to provide recommendations for innovating Mental Health care in VA has 
been established and will be given this report to help guide its work. A report from this inter-

agency group will be forth-coming to the inter-agency task force developed to implement the 
Mental Health Executive Order which is highly focused on suicide prevention. The work of this 
group includes developing action plans to address risk in a broader sense for all patients in 

both mental health and 
non-mental health settings.  This includes reassessing the value of 
traditional suicide risk assessments and screening (which is done now extensively in VA), and 

adding ways to identify life stressors and concerns earlier. Improving risk identification through 

these alternative approaches and increasing the numbers of Veterans who are engaged in the 
enhanced follow-up program may address that identified sensitive time period following VA 
contact as an outpatient as well as for inpatients. 
Population groups indentified in the report that require additional interventions and 
engagement include women Veterans and Vietnam Era Veterans. Additional VA training 

programs will be developed targeting providers of these groups of patients and Suicide 
Prevention Coo

awareness and risk assessment for all staff. 
Outreach remains critically important. Knowing that 
VA treatment strategies are effective 
provides an impetus to get more Veterans involved in treatment programs earlier. Maintaining 
53    
       
    
   
    

      
   
   
    
 
   
the availability of the Veterans Crisis Line to address all areas of concern for Veterans is 
valuable. Our communication and outreach strategies appear to be effective in this area 
we 
should continue our work and expand in this area. 
VA recognizes its role and responsibility in maintaining the safety and well-being of our 


interventions for those Veterans at risk for suicide and those suffering from mental health 

related concerns through research and practice using all available information and data. We 
will continue to add to this information base as data continues to become available and provide 
updates to this on-going report.
