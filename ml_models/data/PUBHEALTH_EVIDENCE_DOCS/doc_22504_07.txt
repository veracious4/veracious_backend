 Verifying Department Contact  With the growing number of scams targeting unsuspecting citizens and businesses, the Department of Revenue would like to encourage the public to safeguard against any potential fraudulent activity.
 If you are contacted by someone representing themselves as an employee of the Florida Department of Revenue—whether it is by letter or form, a phone call or other communication—who appears unfamiliar with your specific tax or child support account information, please feel free to verify their identity by contacting the Department's Taxpayer Services Process at    850-488-6800 or by contacting the Child Support Customer Contact Center at 850-488-KIDS (5437).
