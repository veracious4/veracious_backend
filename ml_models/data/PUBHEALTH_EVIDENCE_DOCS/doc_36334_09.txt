 pic.twitter.com/moRN6N4UbV— Complex (@Complex) June 13, 2019The tweet was viewed more than 13 million times in just 24 hours.
 @Complex did not include any additional information about the “Gyro Drop” ride, such as its location.However, replies to the tweet addressed whether the clip was genuine.
 One user shared a different video of the “Gyro Drop” ride that did not include the “swing” at a stomach-dropping height:Research…Ride: Gyro Dropaddy: Seoul, South KoreaLocated: “Lotte World” (amusement park)Oh and it’s fake😃Original ride goes up while spinning and down.
 No swings.

 A 2006 YouTube video showed the same ride in the same location, but without the swinging effect:Popular debunking Twitter account @HoaxEye sent several tweets in response to the many versions of the Gyro Drop video, explaining that the most notably portion of the clip was computer generated:That video is not real.
 It is actually a piece from a short film ‘The Centrifuge Brain Project’ by Till Nowak.
 A clip of VFX/CGI has been taken out of context.
 https://t.co/7IvWaD1v8j— HoaxEye (@hoaxeye) June 13, 2019Omg this old CGI/VFX marketing stunt always comes back.

 https://t.co/qv0wTiDhLL https://t.co/AHUAHGJVYs— HoaxEye (@hoaxeye) June 13, 2019One more time, because this video is very viral and I keep receiving questions about it.
 That is CGI footage from a short film ‘The Centrifuge Brain Project’ by Till Nowak.
 You can find the original from YouTube.
 https://t.co/5ilnlTWKsx— HoaxEye (@hoaxeye) June 14, 2019The UK’s Independent explained the function of the edited version of Gyro Drop versus the actual ride:In the footage, the tower extends to a quite alarming height and as the carousel rises up the seats drop down and effectively become swings and begin to rotate before dropping back down to the ground.
 […]Rather than having dangerous looking swings drop down from the carousel, the seats remain in place as the ride spins around before dropping again.A version of the clip tweeted by @Complex appeared on YouTube, but that iteration was labeled as creative fiction:Gyro Drop is a real ride, but the video in which social media was awash in June 2019 is completely false.
