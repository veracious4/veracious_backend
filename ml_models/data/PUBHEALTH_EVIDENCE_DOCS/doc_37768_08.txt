The post read:Parece ser que un imbécil ha escrito la palabra “asesino” en la estatua que está en la plaza de toros de las Ventas del Dr. Fleming, descubridor de la penicilina.
 ¿Pensará que fue un torero?Translated into English, the post says:It looks like some imbecile wrote the word “murderer” on the statue at the Las Ventas Plaza de Toros of Dr. Fleming, who discovered penicilin.
 Does this imbecile know that millions of lives were saved thanks to Fleming?
 Do they think he was a bullfighter?Parece ser que un imbécil ha escrito la palabra “asesino” en la estatua que está en la plaza de toros de las Ventas del Dr. Fleming, descubridor de la penicilina.

 La ponen cortada para que parezca que pone “asesino” en vez de asesino.
 Aquí la foto original.
 Que sí, que la pintada está mal, pero que os las meten dobladas.

 Fleming died in 1955.According to Himetop, a site covering historical landmarks devoted to medicine, the memorial to Fleming by sculptor Emilio Laiz Campos was erected outside Las Ventas in May 1964; the inscription, “In gratitude from the bullfighters,” makes reference to the effects that penicillin had in helping bullfighters treat infections and wounds that would have killed them prior to the drug’s development.A full view of the tribute shows a separate statue placed in front of the bust of Fleming shows a separate, smaller statue of a bullfighter doffing his hat (or a montera, as it is traditionally called) to the Scottish native in tribute:We contacted both Darío Madrid asking about the apparent similarity between their post and the older photographs apparently showing the same graffiti and Las Ventas asking if there had been any recent reports of vandalism at the stadium, but we have not yet heard back.Comments eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'truthorfiction_com-medrectangle-1','ezslot_6',127,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'truthorfiction_com-medrectangle-1','ezslot_7',127,'0','1']));eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'truthorfiction_com-medrectangle-1','ezslot_8',127,'0','2']));Article Sources +Los Alrededores de Las Ventas Plenos de Pintadas Vandálicas AntitauirinasA Esos que nos Insultan y Quieren Nuestro Mal.
