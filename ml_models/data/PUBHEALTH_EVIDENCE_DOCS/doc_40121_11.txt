Screening of blood donors for infection with T. cruzi was started in 2007 in the US.
 Currently, benznidazole and nifurtimox are available to treat this infection through direct request from the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) under compassionate use protocols.
 This study analyzed epidemiological trends in diagnosis and treatment for Chagas disease in the US and assessed national and state barriers to access.
 Data on the distribution of cases of Chagas disease identified in blood donors and drug releases were obtained from the AABB and CDC respectively.
 Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 30 key informants at the national level and in 6 high-burden states (CA, FL, VA, NY, MA, and TX) where treatments were provided.
 Interview responses were analyzed according to the health systemâ€™s dimensions of regulation, financing, payment, organization, and persuasion.
 Data indicate that 1,908 cases were identified in the blood donation system from 2007-2013 and that CDC provided 422 courses of benznidazole or nifurtimox during this period.
 Interview data revealed that local ad-hoc procedures were used by individual physicians with an interest in the disease to increase access to medicines for Chagas disease, especially through cross-financing of patient care activities using grants and donations.
 The primary barriers to access at the national level include limited diagnostic and institutionalized referral and care processes (Organization), lack of financing for patient care activities in most states (Financing), and limited awareness and training among physicians and patients (Persuasion).
 This study demonstrates that access to treatment for Chagas disease in the US is limited.
 The lack of licensing for the two medications used in treatment was only one of several barriers to access, highlighting the need for a health systems perspective when scaling up access to these essential medicines.
