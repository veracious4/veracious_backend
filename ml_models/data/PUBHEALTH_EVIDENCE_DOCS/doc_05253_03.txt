 Introduction
Notes about this report:
The overall response proportion was 17%.
2 The ACHA-National College Health Assessment II (ACHA-NCHA II) is a national 
research survey organized by the American College Health Association (ACHA) to 
assist college health service providers, health educators, counselors, and 
administrators in collecting data about their students' habits, behaviors, and 
perceptions on the most prevalent health topics.
ACHA initiated the original ACHA-NCHA in 2000 and the instrument was used 
nation wide through the spring 2008 data collection period. The ACHA-NCHA  now 

provides the largest known comprehensive data set on the health of college students, 

providing the college health and higher education fields with a vast spectrum of 
information on student health. A revised survey, the ACHA-NCHA-II, has been in 
use since the fall 2008 data collection period.
Please note the ACHA-NCHA II is not appropriate for trend comparison with items 
from the original ACHA-NCHA survey. Directly comparing pre- and post-redesign 

estimates on similar data points, without taking into account the impact of the

A note about the use of sex and gender in this report:
  Survey responses are
reported by sex based on the responses to questions 47a, 47b, and 47c.  For the
purpose of the ACHA-NCHA report documents, respondents are reported as male or

female only when their responses to these three questions are consistent with one

another.  If students' gender identity is consistent with their sex at birth AND the

student selects "no" for transgender, then respondents are designated as either 
male
or 
female.
  If respondents select "yes" for transgender OR their sex at birth is not
consistent with their gender identity, then they are designated as 
non-binary.
  Arespondent that skips any of the three questions is designated as 
unknown.
 Totals
displayed in this report include 
non-binary
 and 
unknown
 students.

Estimated Blood Alcohol Concentration  (or eBAC) of college students reporting 1 or more drinks 
the last time they "partied" or socialized. 
Students reporting 0 drinks were excluded from the analysis
. 
Due to the improbability of a student surviving a drinking episode resulting in an extremely high eBAC, 
all students with an eBAC of 0.50 or higher are also omitted from these eBAC figures. eBAC is
an estimated figure based on the reported number of drinks consumed during the last time they 
"partied" or socialized, their approximate time of consumption, sex, weight, and the average rate
of ethanol metabolism.
