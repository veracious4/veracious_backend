 The treatment groups (A and B) were given 0.04mg/kg body weight and 0.08mg/kg of monosodium glutamate thoroughly mixed with the grower's marsh, respectively on a daily basis.
 The control group (C); received equal amount of feeds (Growers’ mash) without monosodium glutamate added for fourteen days.
 The grower's mash was obtained from Edo Feeds and Flour Mill Ltd, Ewu, Edo State and the rats were given water liberally.
 The rats were sacrificed on day fifteen of the experiment.
 One such food additive is Monosodium Glutamate (MSG).
 It is sold in most open market stalls and stores in Nigeria as “Ajinomoto” marketed by West African Seasoning Company Limited; as “Vedan” or “White Maggi” marketed by Mac and Mei (Nig) Limited.Locally and globally, much controversy has been generated concerning the safety of this product.3 In Nigeria, most communities and individuals often use MSG as a bleaching agent and there is a growing trepidation that its excellent bleaching properties could be harmful to humans and may induce life-threatening ailment in consumers.
 Despite indication of pessimistic consumer retort to MSG, reputable international organizations and nutritionist have continued to preserve MSG usage, reiterating that it has no undesirable effects in humans.4 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States reports that Monosodium glutamate is harmless and that it should be kept on the “Generally Recognised as Safe” (GRAS)-list of foods.
 MSG is thus permitted not to be dangerous food additive.
 As a consequence, it requires no specified daily intake, or an upper limit intake requirement.The toxic effect of MSG on male reproductive system was substantiated by a study done on the testis of male wistar rats.
 About 15% of cases of female infertility investigation will show no abnormality.
 Groups A and B serve as treatment while C was the control.
 The rats were obtained and maintained in the Animal Holdings of the Department of Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Benin, Benin city, Nigeria.
 They were fed with grower's marsh obtained from Edo feed and flour mill limited, Ewu, Edo state and given water liberally.
 The rats gained maximum acclimatisation for four weeks before actual commencement of the experiment.
 The Monosodium glutamate (3g/ sachet containing 99+% of MSG) was obtained from Kersmond grocery stores, Uselu, Benin city.Monosodium Glutamate AdministrationThe rats in the treatment groups (A and B) were given 0.04mg/kg body weight and 0.08mg/kg of monosodium glutamate thoroughly mixed with the growers′ mash, respectively on a daily basis.
 The control group (C); received equal amount of feeds (Growers′ mash) without monosodium glutamate added for fourteen days.
 The rats were sacrificed on the fifteenth day of the experiment.
 The 0.04mg/kg and 0.08mg/kg MSG doses were chosen and extrapolated in this experiment based on the the previous work done with the additive.12,13,14 The two doses were thoroughly mixed with fixed amount of feeds (550g-arrived at during the pilot study) in each group.Histological StudyThe tissue were dehydrated in an ascending grade of alcohol (ethanol), cleared in xylene and embedded in paraffin wax.
 Serial sections of 7 microns thick were obtained using a rotatory microtome.
 The deparaffinised sections were stained routinely with haematoxylin and eosin.
 Degenerative and atrophic changes were observed in the oocyte and zona granulosa; these were more pronounced in those that had 0.08mg/kg of MSG mixed in their feed.
 ×400)DiscussionThe results of the haematoxylin and eosin staining (H &amp; E) reactions showed some cellular hypertrophy of the theca folliculi, complete distortion/destruction of the basement membrane separating the theca folliculi from the zona granulosa.
 Degenerative and atrophic changes were observed in the oocyte and zona granulosa; these were more pronounced in those that had 0.08mg/kg of MSG.
 There were marked vacuolations appearing in the stroma cell.The increase in cellular hypertrophy of the theca folliculi in the treatment groups as reported in this study may have been as a result of cellular proliferation caused by the improved intake of food which MSG influences.6,7,8 This corroborates the fact that MSG causes an increase in appetite and thereby leading to increase in weight and obesity.8 The vacuolation probably indicates the presence of mucous.
 Degenerative changes have been reported to result in cell death, which is of two types, namely apoptotic and necrotic cell death.
 The process of cellular necrosis involves disruption of membrane's structural and functional integrity which was also a landmark of this experiment.
 Thus MSG may be implicated in the aetiology of anovulatory infertility.
 It is recommended that further studies, including hormonal assay be carried out to corroborate these findings.18References1.
