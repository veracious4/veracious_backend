 Recurrence and survival seem to be improved only in postmenopausal patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
 We investigated whether MAF amplification (a biomarker for bone metastasis) in primary tumours could predict the treatment outcomes of adjuvant zoledronic acid.MethodsThe study population included patients enrolled in the international, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 AZURE trial at eligible UK sites who had stage II or III breast cancer and who gave consent for use of their primary tumour samples.
 Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard adjuvant systemic therapy alone (control group) or with zoledronic acid every 3–4 weeks for six doses, then every 3–6 months until the end of 5 years.
 Minimisation took into account the number of involved axillary lymph nodes, clinical tumour stage, oestrogen-receptor status, type and timing of systemic therapy, menopausal status, statin use, and treating centre.
 The primary endpoint was disease-free survival; the secondary endpoint, invasive-disease-free survival, was the primary disease endpoint for the analysis in this report.
 MAF amplification was assessed by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation of two cores of breast tumour tissue in a microarray, done in a central laboratory by technicians unaware of treatment assignment.
 We also assessed interactions between MAF-positive status and menopausal status on efficacy of zoledronic acid.
 The AZURE trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry, number ISRCTN79831382.Findings1739 AZURE patients contributed primary tumour samples, of whom 865 (50%) had two assessable cores (445 in the control groups and 420 in the zoledronic acid group).
 184 (21%) tumours were MAF positive (85 in the control groups and 99 in the zoledronic acid group) and the remaining tumours were MAF negative.
 At a median follow-up of 84·6 months (IQR 72·0–95·8), MAF status was not prognostic for invasive-disease-free survival in the control group (MAF-positive vs MAF-negative: hazard ratio [HR] 0·92, 95% CI 0·59–1·41), but was in the zoledronic acid group (0·52, 0·36–0·75).
 In patients with MAF-negative tumours, zoledronic acid was associated with higher invasive-disease-free survival than was control treatment (HR 0·74, 95% CI 0·56–0·98), but not in patients who had MAF-positive tumours.

 A proteomics discovery platform revealed that coexpression of PDZ domain-containing protein GIPC1 and macrophage-capping protein CAPG by primary tumours was predictive of benefit from adjuvant zoledronic acid in women with early breast cancer.8Westbrook JA Cairns DA Peng J et al.CAPG and GIPC1: breast cancer biomarkers for bone metastasis development and treatment.J Natl Cancer Inst.
 2016; 108: djv360Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar So far, however, no data have supported the clinical application of this discovery, and the reproducibility of these analyses awaits confirmation.Research in contextEvidence before this studyWhen we were planning this study, the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group showed in a meta-analysis that adjuvant bisphosphonates help to prevent bone metastasis and extend survival in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.
 We searched PubMed for studies of biomarkers to predict benefit from adjuvant bisphosphonates, using the search terms “metastasis“, “biomarkers“, “bisphosphonates“, and “breast cancer“.
 We restricted the language of publication to English but did not apply date restrictions.
 We also searched major conference websites for abstracts presented since 2005.
 We found no evidence of relevant biomarkers.
 Rather, patients are selected for treatment based on clinical criteria alone.
 As a result, the routine use of adjuvant bisphosphonates, which is now recommended by guidelines in Europe and North America, is hampered by the complexities of defining postmenopausal status in some patients.
 Additionally, there is no clear biological rationale for why treatment benefits seem to be confined to women with low concentrations of reproductive hormones.
 Among patients enrolled in the randomised, phase 3 AZURE trial of adjuvant zoledronic acid plus standard adjuvant treatment versus standard adjuvant treatment alone, expression of MAF, a bone-metastasis biomarker, has been measured in primary tumours.Added value of this studyThis study explored the association between treatment benefit, disease recurrence, and MAF amplification status.
 In patients with MAF-negative tumours, the use of adjuvant zoledronic acid was associated with improved disease outcomes, irrespective of menopausal status or age.
 By contrast, increased adverse outcomes, extraskeletal recurrence, and mortality were seen among women who were not menopausal at the start of the treatment with MAF-positive tumours and who received zoledronic acid.
 Assessment of MAF status, therefore, seems to provide an objective way to select breast cancer patients for adjuvant bisphosphonate treatment.Implications of all the available evidenceTesting for MAF amplification in tumours is a potential companion diagnostic on which to base the decision of whether to use adjuvant zoledronic acid in patients with early breast cancer.
 Prospective validation of these findings in another randomised trial is warranted.MAF, a biomarker of bone relapse in early breast cancer,9Pavlovic M Arnal-Estapé A Rojo F et al.Enhanced MAF oncogene expression and breast cancer bone metastasis.J Natl Cancer Inst.

 We retrospectively tested tumour samples from patients in the AZURE study to assess whether MAF status had prognostic value or could predict the treatment effects of adjuvant therapy with zoledronic acid.Methods Study design and patients3360 patients from 174 centres worldwide were recruited to the AZURE trial between Sept 4, 2003, and Feb 16, 2006.

 Other inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, Karnofsky performance status score 80 or more, and not being pregnant or breastfeeding.
 Patients were excluded if they had clinical or imaging evidence of distant metastases, current or recent ( 10 years).
 Therefore, these results are not considered further in this report.Mean MAF copy number per nucleus was scored in 20 nuclei from the region of the tumour with the highest amplification, by laboratory staff who were masked to treatment group.
 If the mean copy number was between 2·0 and 3·0, 30 more nuclei were scored.
 To keep the effect of tumour heterogeneity in such small fragments to a minimum, duplicate results were mandated for each patient.
 Thus, replica cores were scored until two FISH amplification values were obtained for each tumour, of which the highest per patient was used in the statistical analysis.
 The TMAs were analysed by FISH without optimisation or repetition, as stipulated in the study protocol.
 Patients for whom the mean MAF copy number was 2·5 or greater in at least one replica were deemed to be MAF positive.
 This threshold was based on studies in a retrospective cohort9Pavlovic M Arnal-Estapé A Rojo F et al.Enhanced MAF oncogene expression and breast cancer bone metastasis.J Natl Cancer Inst.

 Hypothesis testing was two-sided with significance at 5%.
 No adjustments were made for multiplicity.The predictive analysis assessing the interaction of MAF status and treatment effect of zoledronic acid, was done with a Cox proportional hazards model.

 We did sensitivity analyses that included all prespecified prognostic factors for this model.

 Open table in a new tab       Among patients in the control group, 118 (33%) of 360 with MAF-negative tumours and 29 (34%) of 85 with MAF-positive tumours had an invasive-disease-free survival event, suggesting that MAF status was not prognostic for this endpoint (figure 1).
 Among postmenopausal patients in the control group, MAF-negative status was associated with a shorter invasive-disease-free survival than was MAF-positive status, whereas among non-postmenopausal patients, the invasive-disease-free survival was longer for patients with MAF-negative tumours than those with MAF-positive tumours (figure 1).
 A similar effect was seen for overall survival (appendix).
 Menopausal status did not substantially alter the effect of MAF status on disease outcome in the zoledronic acid group (figure 1).13 bone-only invasive-disease-free survival events and six bone plus extraskeletal events were seen in patients with MAF-positive tumours, with 47 and 26, respectively, seen in patients with MAF-negative tumours.
 Treatment benefits with zoledronic acid were similar irrespective of menopausal status or age (figure 3).
 By contrast, in patients with MAF-positive tumours, although zoledronic acid was not associated with longer invasive-disease-free survival, there was significant heterogeneity in the treatment effect by menopause status and age (figure 3).
 Not being postmenopausal at the start of treatment or age younger than 50 years had clear adverse effects on invasive-disease-free survival in patients treated with zoledronic acid (figure 3).
 Fewer patients with MAF-negative tumours treated with zoledronic acid died than did those in the control group (57 [18%] of 321 vs 76 [21%] of 360; HR 0·78, 95% CI 0·55–1·10).
 Among patients with MAF-positive tumours, no effect of zoledronic acid was seen on overall survival (34 [34%] of 99 died vs 26 [31%] of 85; HR 1·11, 95% CI 0·66–1·86).
 In women with MAF-positive tumours who were non-postmenopausal at the start of treatment there was, however, a clear adverse effect of zoledronic acid on overall survival (24 [36%] of 66 patients in the zoledronic acid group died vs nine [16%] of 55 patients in the control group; HR 2·27, 95% CI 1·04–4·93), which contrasts with the treatment effect of zoledronic acid on overall survival in postmenopausal women with MAF-positive tumours (ten [30%] of 33 patients in the zoledronic acid group died vs 17 [57%] of 30 in the control group; 0·62, 0·27–1·48).190 patients had an extraskeletal invasive-disease-free survival event (92 in the control group and 98 in the zoledronic acid group).
 When compared with the control group, treatment with zoledronic acid in non-postmenopausal women with MAF-positive tumours was associated with a marked increase in relapse at extraskeletal sites (figure 4).
 The estimated extra-skeletal invasive-disease-free survival at 60 months for patients with MAF-positive tumours was 5·7% (95% CI 1·5–14·2) in the control group and 38·8% (27·1–50·3) in the zoledronic acid group (figure 4).
 We saw no effect of zoledronic acid treatment on extraskeletal recurrence in patients with MAF-negative tumours who were non-postmenopausal at the start of treatment (extraskeletal invasive-disease-free survival at 60 months was 18·0%, 95% CI 13·5–23·1 in the control group and 19·8%, 14·8–25·5 in the zoledronic acid group; figure 4).Figure 4Cumulative risk of extraskeletal first recurrence in women not postmenopausal at trial entry, by treatment groupShow full caption(A) Patients with MAF-positive tumours.

 Events for this endpoint were death and local or contralateral invasive disease.
 First events in bone were a competing risk.
 We did, however, note heterogeneity in outcomes by menopausal status in addition to MAF status in patients in the control groups, as those with MAF-positive tumours who were not postmenopausal at the start of treatment had significantly better invasive-disease-free survival than those who were postmenopausal (HR 0·26, 95% CI 0·12–0·56).
 We found also that non-postmenopausal patients in the control group with MAF-positive tumours seemed to have a longer invasive-disease-free survival than patients in the control group with MAF-negative tumours (table 3).Table 3Invasive-disease-free survival by MAF status, menopausal status, and treatmentNumber of patients (number of events)Hazard ratio (95% CI)MAF-negativeNon-postmenopausal control group253 (83)1Postmenopausal control group107 (35)1·25 (0·80–1·95)Non-postmenopausal zoledronic acid group216 (61)0·83 (0·59–1·15)Postmenopausal zoledronic acid group105 (29)0·85 (0·53–1·36)MAF-positiveNon-postmenopausal control group55 (11)0·63 (0·33–1·20)Postmenopausal control group30 (18)2·68 (1·53–4·68)Non-postmenopausal zoledronic acid group66 (33)1·61 (1·06–2·44)Postmenopausal zoledronic acid group33 (12)1·72 (0·90–3·29)        Open table in a new tab       We found no difference in invasive-disease-free survival when age was used as a surrogate marker for menopause (table 4), with similar beneficial effects in both age groups seen with zoledronic acid in patients with MAF-negative tumours (figure 3).

 Our data strongly suggest, therefore, that women who are not definitely postmenopausal and who have MAF-positive tumours should not receive an adjuvant bisphosphonate.Our study has several limitations.
 First, we retrospectively analysed samples, and our findings require confirmation in another dataset.
 Second, because of the complex interactions between MAF status, bisphosphonate treatment, and menopausal status, the number of patients with reliable FISH results was too small to assess outcomes in some of the subgroups of interest.
 Third, although we mandated assessment of MAF in two tissue cores per patient to reduce the effect of tumour heterogeneity, assessment of routine tissue sections may reveal greater heterogeneity of expression than we could identify in replicate TMA cores.The use of adjuvant bisphosphonates in early breast cancer and selection of appropriate patients remain areas of controversy.

 2017; 35: 2062-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google ScholarOur findings should be viewed as hypothesis generating, but they clearly suggest that the beneficial effects of zoledronic acid on breast cancer are associated with the presence of a non-amplified MAF gene within the primary tumour.
 By contrast, in women with MAF-positive tumours who are not postmenopausal at the start of treatment, outcomes seem to be poor among those receiving zoledronic acid.
 Among non-postmenopausal women or those younger than 50 years, we identified two distinct subpopulations: women with MAF-negative tumours who, like older patients with MAF-negative tumours, benefited from zoledronic acid; and women with MAF-positive tumours in whom use of zoledronic acid was associated with extraskeletal metastatic disease and worse survival in the presence of reproductive hormones.
 This difference resulted in a net zero effect in the non-postmenopausal subgroup, in the biomarker cohort, and the AZURE trial population as a whole.
 Additional mechanistic studies addressing the importance of MAF in cancer metastasis are in progress.
 It is hoped that these investigations will provide some biological insights into the differential effects of bisphosphonates on disease outcomes according to MAF status and menopausal status and improve understanding of how tumour biology and treatments that affect the metastatic niche, the endocrine milieu, and host and tumour-cell functions interact.
 Before testing can be considered for routine clinical practice, MAF status needs further assessment in another large randomised trial of adjuvant bisphosphonates.
 Such a study is planned to take place in 2018 using the NSABP B-34 tumour bank and dataset for patients randomly assigned to treatment with the oral bisphosphonate clodronic acid or placebo.14Paterson AH Anderson SJ Lembersky BC et al.Oral clodronate for adjuvant treatment of operable breast cancer (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project protocol B-34): a multicentre, placebo-controlled, randomised trial.Lancet Oncol.
 2012; 13: 734-742Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google ScholarAmong the 865 patients assessable for MAF status and during a median follow-up of 84 months, there were only 60 invasive-disease-free survival events in bone, which made interpretation of any association between MAF status and bone relapse unreliable.
 We were thus unable to confirm the prognostic capability of MAF status proposed by Pavlovic and colleagues.9Pavlovic M Arnal-Estapé A Rojo F et al.Enhanced MAF oncogene expression and breast cancer bone metastasis.J Natl Cancer Inst.
 2015; 107: djv256Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar We found that MAF amplification was associated with adverse biological characteristics, such as oestrogen-receptor negativity, high tumour grade, and HER2 positivity, but could not show clinically useful independent prognostic value for bone metastasis.
 Although MAF-positive tumours were associated with worse disease outcomes than MAF-negative tumours in the control group who were postmenopausal at the start of treatment, our findings are not robust enough to recommend use of this biomarker in routine risk assessments.
 Because bone relapses typically occur late in the follow-up of patients with early breast cancer, further assessment is planned in the AZURE trial patients now they have completed 10 years of follow-up.
 This analysis is anticipated to increase the number of bone events by around a third.
 Use of other datasets is likely to be necessary to provide sufficient events to fully assess the association between MAF-positive tumours and the development of bone metastasis.
 We believe, however, that the clinical interest in MAF status will relate to the predictive capabilities we describe rather than its use as another prognostic factor.The heterogeneity in invasive-disease-free survival by menopausal status among patients in the control group with MAF-negative tumours cannot be adequately explained by imbalances in other prognostic factors.
 Other than a slight excess of larger T2–T4 tumours in non-postmenopausal women than in postmenopausal women (72% vs 62%), the clinical and pathological characteristics were similar across these subgroups.Collectively, our observations point to MAF as a potential molecular target for the prevention or treatment of metastases from breast cancer.9Pavlovic M Arnal-Estapé A Rojo F et al.Enhanced MAF oncogene expression and breast cancer bone metastasis.J Natl Cancer Inst.
 2015; 107: djv256Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar However, although required for metastasis, its nuclear localisation and lack of a catalytic domain make MAF a very challenging pharmacological target.
 Dissecting the role of genes that are transcriptionally regulated by MAF might lead to the identification of potentially targetable proteins that are necessary for metastasis,9Pavlovic M Arnal-Estapé A Rojo F et al.Enhanced MAF oncogene expression and breast cancer bone metastasis.J Natl Cancer Inst.

 Women with MAF-negative tumours are likely to represent almost 80% of those with breast cancers who could benefit from the use of adjuvant zoledronic acid.
 MAF positivity seemed to be associated with adverse disease outcomes when women were treated with zoledronic acid, especially if treatment was started in women not definitely postmenopausal, and we recommend that exposure to bisphosphonates should be avoided in such women in the adjuvant setting.ContributorsJA, JJ-M, J-CT, FR, and RRG developed the MAFTEST biomarker.
