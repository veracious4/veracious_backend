Alderman calls for ending fluoridation of Milwaukee's drinking water By Karen Herzog of the Journal Sentinel Published on: 5/29/2012  Ald.
 Jim Bohl set off a chain reaction of news conferences Tuesday after he called for an end to fluoridating Milwaukee's drinking water and told reporters he drinks bottled water because he doesn't trust the safety of tap water.Bohl accused the city Health Department of taking the "safe and easy and incorrect route" because Health Commissioner Bevan Baker released a statement opposing the alderman's proposal before Bohl even stepped in front of cameras to formally announce it.While Baker was in meetings Tuesday morning and did not hear Bohl's remarks directly, Baker quickly crossed the street from his office to defend the city's drinking water after an aide told him what Bohl had said.Milwaukee has "the cleanest, safest, freshest water in the area," Baker said from the same podium Bohl used minutes earlier.Fluoridated water is "the one universal barrier to reduce tooth decay," Baker said.
 "Why would you remove that?
 "The 40 largest cities in America all add fluoride to their water, Baker told reporters.Bohl said research independent of government agencies "shows countless adverse health effects" linked to increased consumption of fluoride, which accumulates in the body.When fluoride was first added to drinking water, it wasn't added to foods, beverages and toothpaste, as it is today, he said.
 Milwaukee started fluoridating its water in 1953.
 Toothpaste with fluoride came along in the late 1960s.
 "The fact is, we are overdosed on fluoride," Bohl said.Bohl proposed diverting the $540,000 the city spends annually to fluoridate water to offer critical dental services to children in low-income neighborhoods.The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers fluoridation of drinking water one of the 10 public health achievements of the 20th century.Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral in water, including Lake Michigan - the source of Milwaukee's drinking water.Prevents cavitiesJust enough fluoride is added to drinking water to help prevent dental cavities; it's not enough to cause harm, according to William Bailey, acting director of the CDC's division of oral health.The government does monitor fluoride consumption and commissions rigorous scientific reviews, said Barbara Gooch, associate director for scientific research in the CDC's division of oral health.The Environmental Protection Agency is considering slightly lowering its recommendation for the amount of fluoride that should be added to drinking water because other fluoride sources have become abundant, she said.Studies since the 1980s have found that communities with fluoridated drinking water have reduced tooth decay by about 25%, Bailey said.Tooth decay remains the most common chronic disease of children ages 6 to 11 years (25%) and of adolescents ages 12 to 19 years (59%), according to the CDC.Bailey said a condition called dental fluorosis, "mild white spots on teeth that are most apparent to dental professionals," has increased among children under age 8, and that's one reason the recommendations for drinking water fluoridation levels may decrease.
 Fluorosis is a cosmetic concern, he said, adding that what dentists see in patients is mild and rare.It would require an industrial accident, or intentional act, to overdose on fluoride, Bailey said.
 "You couldn't do it with water.
 "Three-fourths of Americans who get their drinking water from community water systems now have access to fluoridated water, Bailey said.The public health benefits of fluoridated water are especially important for low-income residents who can't afford regular preventive dental care, he said.Bohl referred to fluoride as "an industrial toxic substance," and said toxicologists should weigh in on the issue, rather than dentists and public health professionals.Representatives of the Children's Health Alliance of Wisconsin, which manages the Wisconsin Oral Health Coalition and is an entity of Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, and faculty members from the Marquette University School of Dentistry, also had something to say.
 "It's very important people don't become scared by the tactics" of those promoting fluoride removal from drinking water, said Matt Crespin, associate director of the Children's Health Alliance of Wisconsin.DiscussionAld.
