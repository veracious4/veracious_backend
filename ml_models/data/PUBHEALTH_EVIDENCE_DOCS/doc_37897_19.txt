 Subscribe to cleveland.com.Ohio PoliticsSome Ohio coronavirus protesters using anti-Semitic symbolismUpdated Apr 21, 2020; Posted Apr 19, 2020 Hundreds of protestors gathered outside the Ohio Statehouse on Saturday, April 18, 2020, calling for state officials to lift restrictions now, including this car with an anti-Semitic sign.
 (Laura Hancock/cleveland.com)Facebook ShareTwitter ShareBy       Laura Hancock, cleveland.com      COLUMBUS, Ohio - A photo from Saturday’s stay-at-home protest at the Statehouse is gaining traction on Twitter for its anti-Semitic message.The photograph captured two men in a minivan.
 One held a sign with an illustration of rodent with the Star of David on its side and the words “The Real Plague.”The protest movement against coronavirus restrictions has been a mishmash of people.
 Some adhere to public health officials’ guidance of distancing themselves at least 6 feet apart and wearing masks.
 They want to return to work.
 On the more extreme are others who call coronavirus a hoax.But the anti-Semitism might drown out all their messages.On Monday, at least one protestor at the Ohio Statehouse wore a Proud Boys T-shirt.
 The group is described as misogynistic and Islamophobic.On Saturday and Sunday, social media reacted in disgust -- and mockery -- to the sign from the minivan.Awful.— Saeed Jones (@theferocity) April 18, 2020  If there really is a master race, I am positive they don’t drive a rusted out minivan.— jimJim Macris (@jimJimMacris) April 18, 2020  Make sure to pass this out dummies pic.twitter.com/UA4qgyBDqK— Tim Minneci (@timminneci) April 18, 2020  Jewish state Rep. Casey Weinstein, a Hudson Democrat, posted on Twitter another photo of the men outside the minivan at the protest.
 He wasn’t at the protest but he followed it on social media.Hey!
 A second pic of these cool dudes from today.
 #makethemfamous pic.twitter.com/5y8UCJuvNQ— Rep. Casey Weinstein (@RepWeinstein) April 19, 2020  “There are symbols of hatred mixed in," he said.
 “I think it’s important to call that out.
 I’m not going to let that pass.
 I’m not.
 There are people out there exercising their rights.
 By no means am I saying they’re all anti-Semitic, they’re all racists, but there is an element there.”Weinstein said that the protestors have a constitutional right to protest -- Ohio’s stay-at-home order specifically carves out “First Amendment-protected speech.” “I’m glad to support everyone’s First Amendment right to express their view, and I will gladly exercise mine to push back on anti-Semitism whenever and wherever I see it,” Weinstein said.In Ohio, one of the groups that organized Saturday’s rally was Ohio Gun Owners, a relatively new organization to the state’s political scene that uses incendiary rhetoric mostly at gun-friendly lawmakers, hoping for them to further their policy agenda.
 Ohio Gun Owners is a copycat of similar groups the founder’s family started in other states.Earlier protests were organized by other groups, including Ohio Stands Strong, that are opposed to Gov.
 Mike DeWine’s public health orders, deny the effectiveness of vaccines and whose members have been driving by DeWine’s Greene County house, filming it and counting cars.
 A spokesman for DeWine had said last week the governor’s security detail was aware of the surveillance and he couldn’t say anything beyond that.Ohio Stands Strong also uses imagery with a red pill, which the Anti-Defamation League says symbolizes political awakening and commitment -- including sometimes commitment as extreme as believing Jews control the world.Wednesday’s Lansing, Michigan protest was promoted by the Michigan Freedom Fund, which is linked to the family of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, although it appears another group may have organized the event.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
