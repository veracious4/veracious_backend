 Summary of eRumor: The story appears to be a    BBC report about an alleged fight in a Cambodian arena between 42    midgets and an African lion.
 The story says that the midgets were of the Cambodian Midget    Fighting League and that 28 of them died before the contest was    halted.
 The Truth:This circulated pretty quickly around    the Internet during May, 2005, but it never really appeared on the    BBC site because it was a hoax.
 The story was originally posted at http://lionvs40midgets.tripod.com.
 Later, the author posted an apology and an admission that it was a    hoax.
 Tripod quickly shut the site down saying it violated its policies.
 The apology page said that the author created the hoax “to ‘settle’ a dispute    between a friend of mine in which he claimed that 40 weaponless    midgets could defeat 1 lion in a hypothetical fight.
 Many of my    other friends and I tried to convince him that the lion would    definitely win, but he would not back down from his argument.
