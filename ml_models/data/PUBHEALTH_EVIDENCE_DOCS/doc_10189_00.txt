 Guidelines and Measures This AHRQ microsite was set up by AHRQ to provide users a place to find information about its legacy guidelines and measures clearinghouses, National Guideline ClearinghouseTM (NGC) and National Quality Measures ClearinghouseTM (NQMC).
 This information was previously available on guideline.gov and qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov, respectively.
 Both sites were taken down on July 16, 2018, because federal funding though AHRQ was no longer available to support them.

 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Created in 1984, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF or Task Force) is an independent group of national experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine that works to improve the health of all Americans by making evidence-based recommendations about clinical preventive services such as screenings, counseling services, or preventive medications.
 The USPSTF is made up of 16 volunteer members who come from the fields of preventive medicine and primary care, including internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, behavioral health, obstetrics/gynecology, and nursing.
 All members volunteer their time to serve on the USPSTF, and most are practicing clinicians.
 Learn more about the USPSTF Visit the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, 2012-2014 The Guide to Clinical Preventive Services includes U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on screening, counseling, and preventive medication topics and includes clinical considerations for each topic.
 This new pocket guide is an authoritative source for making decisions about preventive services.
