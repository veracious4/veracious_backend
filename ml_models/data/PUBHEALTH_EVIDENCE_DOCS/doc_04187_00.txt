 In Bradenton, the Manatee River has turned green from the stuff, which the mayor of Holmes Beach calls \"gumbo.\" In Lake Okeechobee, toxins have hit a level three times what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency deems safe.
 Meanwhile state officials have convened a Blue-Green Algae Task Force to figure out how to prevent such blooms in the future.
 So far they have concluded only that the state's current regulations, which rely largely on voluntary anti-pollution measures, don't work very well.Amid fears of another summer of toxic algae afflicting the state and hurting its economy, officials from the state Department of Environmental Protection say they are considering new regulations on how much of the natural toxins are allowed in the state's waterways.One of the environmental groups that petitioned the state to take the step says it's a welcome move.
 But state officials and the environmental activists disagree on how the water pollution regulations ought to be employed to combat the algae blooms.\"The state would be a clear national leader if it set clear numeric limits on these toxins,\" said Jason Totoiu, senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity.
 \"These standards could be used to identify which waters are impaired ... and we feel they would provide\" specific steps for stopping practices that fuel the blooms.However, according to Department of Environmental Protection spokeswoman Dee Ann Miller, the state would use the new limits to determine when and where to declare a public health emergency — not as a tool to try to prevent such emergencies.\"Typically, the criteria would be used by (the Department of Health) to inform statewide health guidance so they are able to promptly issue protective health advisories to the public related to blue-green algal blooms and any associated cyanotoxins,\" Miller said in an email.As for her own agency, she said, \"the water quality criteria would be utilized like other surface water quality criteria.
 It will be used to determine if a waterbody is impaired (i.e.
 not meeting water quality standards).\"And if it's classified as impaired, she said, \"it would be addressed through the Department's water quality restoration process, with restoration projects and strategies identified focused on reducing nutrients.\"So far the state's primary tools for reducing the pollution from nutrients — excess fertilizer and leaks from septic tanks and sewer lines — involves voluntary efforts called \"Best Management Practices.\" Although state law requires it, members of the state Blue-Green Algae Task Force recently noted that just 75 percent of agriculture businesses in the state have adopted best management practices to reduce the nutrients in their runoff.\"The toxic algae has been a massive problem,\" Gov.
 Ron DeSantis said in announcing members of the task force in April.Blue-green algae, also known as \"cyanobacteria,\" occur naturally all over the world.
 They are actually a type of bacteria but, like plants, use sunlight to grow.
 Under the right conditions their population explodes into a massive bloom.
 Once the bloom begins, nutrient pollution in the water can fuel continued growth and expansion.Blue-green algae blooms are most common in Florida in the summer and early fall thanks to consistently high temperatures and abundant sunlight.
 A bloom produces toxins that can aggravate respiratory problems and cause skin rashes to anyone who comes into contact with them.
 Pets can also suffer from the toxinsThe bloom also stinks.
 During a record-size bloom in Martin County three years ago, one resident described the smell as \"death on a cracker.\" That 2016 bloom was so bad it closed the beaches on the Fourth of July, and so thick that observers compared its appearance to guacamole.Florida isn't the only place suffering from blue-green algae outbreaks.
 Lake Erie suffered a major bloom last year and scientists are predicting another this summer.
 As a result, in May the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently released some recommended limits for the toxins produced by the algae.
 That was around the same time the Center for Biological Diversity, Calusa Waterkeeper and Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation petitioned the Florida environmental agency to impose similar limits.\"The department is evaluating EPA's brand-new recommendations as well as the underlying science,\" state Department of Environmental Protection secretary Noah Valenstein wrote in response to the petition.
 He said the agency would take public comment as well as consider the task force's recommendations before deciding on new criteria.
 If it does choose to create new regulations, they will have to be approved by the state's Environmental Regulatory Commission.\"The department is committed to openly and transparently developing sound, scientific criteria to ensure protection of water quality and public health,\" Valenstein wrote in the June 24 reply.

 According to a new study led by scientists from the University of South Florida-St. Petersburg, everyone better get used to it.
 In the Amazon's rain forest, the continued deforestation by farmers has led to an increase in the amount of nutrient pollution flowing out to sea from the Amazon River.
 Meanwhile a regular upwelling current from the ocean's depths pushes nutrients that had been on the bottom up to the surface to further fuel the seaweed's growth.
 Although it doesn't look like much, it provides essential habitat for sea turtles, crabs, fish and ocean-going birds.
 As an ecosystem, it's so vital to the ocean's health that acclaimed oceanographer Sylvia Earle, who grew up in Dunedin, has compared it to a golden rainforest.
 According to National Geographic , the sailors aboard Columbus' Santa María found it to be less of a marvel and more of an obstruction, noting in their ship's log that in some places it was \"so thick that it actually held back the ships.\" Later explorers noticed that the air bladders that keep it afloat resembled a type of grape called sargazo — hence the name.
 Last year 20 million tons of it floated through the Atlantic, and when it died, it sank to the bottom where it smothered corals and sea grass beds.
 Prior to 2011, they saw that it primarily floated in patches around the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic.
 But starting in 2011, the mats became larger and thicker, spreading into areas where it had never been spotted before.
 His team was able to correlate the explosion of sargassum with increases in the Amazon's deforestation and also an increase in the use of fertilizer as farms supplant the rainforest.
 In 2013, one of the ingredients for a big sargassum belt was missing.
 For some reason, the seeds left behind by the previous year's growth weren't as numerous as they had been in prior years.
 Instead, what he meant is that there's no going back to the pre-2011 patterns of growth.
 For instance, the scientists do not know what, if any, role might be played by ocean acidification, which results from the world's oceans soaking up more carbon dioxide than they can handle, which makes the water more acidic.

 A new study led by USF scientists says the sargassum bloom in the Atlantic has been growing larger and larger and this is the new normal.
 He said it helped put a Chinese military communication satellite in orbit, and like most space junk, was being tracked as it circled the planet.
 It's breaking up into multiple pieces.
 It's sort of a classic space debris break-up,\" he told The Associated Press.
