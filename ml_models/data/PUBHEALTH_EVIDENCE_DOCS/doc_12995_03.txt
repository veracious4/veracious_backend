Incident Attribution
 

i
ed version of a highly 
classified assessment that has been provided to the President and to recipients approved by the 
President.  
 

 
The Intelligence 
Community rarely can publicly reveal the full extent of its knowledge or the precise 
bases for its assessments, as the release of such information would reveal sensitive sources or 
methods and imperil the ability to collect critical foreign intelligence in
 
the future.
 

 
Thus, while the conclusions in the report are all reflected in the classified assessment, the declassified 
report does not and cannot include the full supporting information, including specific intelligence and 
sources and methods.
 
The Analyti
c Process
 
The mission of the Intelligence Community is to seek to reduce the uncertainty surrounding foreign 

understand complex issues on which foreig
n actors go to extraordinary lengths to hide or obfuscate their 
activities.  
 

 
On these issues of great importance to US national security, the goal of intelligence analysis is to 
provide assessments to decisionmakers that are intellectually rigorous, objec
tive, timely, 
and 
useful, 
and 
that 
adhere to tradecraft standards.  
 

 
The tradecraft standards for analytic products have been refined over the past ten years.  These 
standards include describing sources (including their reliability and access to the inform
ation they 

judgments and assumptions, exploring alternatives, demonstrating relevance to the customer, using 
strong and transparent logic, and explaining 
change or consistency in judgments over time.  
 

 
Applying these standards helps ensure that the Intelligence Community provides US policymakers, 
warfighters, and operators with the best and most accurate insight, warning, and context, as well as 
potential o
pportunities to advance US national security.  
 
Intelligence Community analysts integrate information from a wide range of sources, including human 
sources, technical collection, and open source information, and apply specialized skills and structured 
anal
ytic tools to draw inferences informed by the data available, relevant past activity, and logic and 
reasoning to provide insight into what is happening and the prospects for the future.  
 

 

sociated with major judgments based 
on the quantity and quality of the source material, information gaps, and the complexity of the issue.  
 

 

conveying an analytic as
sessment or judgment.  
 

 
Some analytic judgments are based directly on collected information; others rest on previous 
judgments, which serve as building blocks in rigorous analysis.  In either type of judgment, the 
tradecraft standards outlined above ensure
 
that 
analysts
 
have an appropriate basis for the judgment. 
 
 2
 

 
Intelligence Community judgments often include two important elements: judgments of how likely it 
is that something has 
happened 

con
fidence levels in those judgments (low, moderate, and high) that refer to the evidentiary basis, 
logic and reasoning, and precedents that underpin the judgments.
 
Determining Attribution in Cyber Incidents
 
The nature of cyberspace makes attribution of cyber operations difficult but not impossible.  Every kind of 
cyber operation

malicious or not

leaves a trail.  US Intelligence Community analysts use this 
information, their constantly growing knowledge base o
f previous events and known malicious actors, and 
their knowledge of how these malicious actors work and the tools that they use, to attempt to trace these 
operations back to their source.  In every case, they apply the same tradecraft standards described 
in the 
Analytic Process above.  
 

 
Analysts consider a series of questions to assess how the information 
compares
 
with
 
existing 
knowledge and adjust their confidence in their judgments as appropriate to account for any 
alternative hypotheses and ambiguities.
 
 
 

 
An assessment of attribution usually is not a simple statement of who conducted an operation, but 
rather a series of judgments that describe whether it was an isolated incident, who was the likely 
perpetrator
,
 

ordering or leading the operation.

Kremlin social media actors, all of whom the Kremlin either 
directly uses to convey messages or who are answerab

Presidential Election
 
 
Putin
 
Ordered Campaign To Influence US 
Election
 
We assess with high confidence that Russian 
President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence 
campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential 
election, the consistent goals of which were to 
undermine public faith in the US democratic 
process, denigrate Secretary
 
Clinton, and harm her 
electability and potential presidency. 
 
We further 
assess Putin and the Russian Government 
developed a clear preference for President
-
elect 
Trump. 
 
When it appeared to Moscow that 
Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the
 
Russian influence campaign then focused on 
undermining her expected presidency. 
 

 
We also assess Putin and the Russian 
Government aspired to help President
-
elect 

discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly 
contrast
ing her unfavorably to him. 
 
All three 
agencies agree with this judgment. 
 
CIA and 
FBI have high confidence in this judgment; 
NSA has moderate confidence.
 

 
In trying to influence the US election, we assess 
the Kremlin sought to advance its longstanding 
desire to undermine the US
-
led liberal 
democratic order, the promotion of which 
Putin and other senior Russian leaders view as 

 
 
 

 
Putin publicly pointed to the Panama Papers 
disclosure and the Olympic doping scandal as
 
US
-
directed efforts to defame Russia, 
suggesting he sought to use disclosures to 
discredit the image of the U
nited 
S
tates
 
and 
cast it as hypocritical.
 

 
Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary 
Clinton because he has publicly blamed her 
since 2011 fo
r inciting mass protests against 
his regime in late 2011 and early 2012
,
 
and 
because he 
holds a grudge for comments he 
almost certainly saw as disparaging him.

Government developed a clear preference for

praising President

Putin has had many positive experiences 
working with Western political leaders whose

to deal with Russia, such as former Italian 
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and former 
German Chancellor G

We assess the influence campaign aspired to help

possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and 
publicly contrasting her unfavorably to the

When it appeared to Moscow that 
Se
cretary Clinton was likely to win the presidency 
the Russian influence campaign focused more on 

crippling her presidency from its start, including by 
impugning the fairness of the election. 
 

 
Before the electi

publicly denounced the US electoral process 
and were prepared to publicly call into 
question the validity of the results.

By
 
their nature, Russian influence campaigns 
are multifaceted and designed to be deniable 
because they use a mix of agents of influence, 
cutouts, front organizations, and false

the Ukraine crisis in 2014, whe

We assess Russian intelligence services collected 
against the US primary campaigns, think tanks, and 
lobbying groups they viewed as likely to shape 
future US poli

In July 2015, Russian 
intelligence gained access to 
Democratic National

access until at least June 2016. 
 

 
The 
General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate 
(

probably began cyber operations aimed 
at the US election by March 2016. 
 
We assess 
that the GRU operations resulted in the

Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an 
independent Romanian hacker, made multiple 
contradictory statements and false claims 
about his likely Russian identity throughout the 
election.  Press reporting suggests more than 
one person 
claiming to be Guccifer 2.0 
interacted with journalists. 
 

 
Content that we assess was taken from e

accounts targeted by the GRU in March 2016

We assess with high confidence that the GRU

worldwide effects that mass disclosures of US 
Government and othe

such as those 
conducted by WikiLeaks and others

have 
achieved in recent years, and their understanding 
of the value of orchestrating such disclosures to 
maximize the impact of compromising information. 
 

 
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union 
used 
intelligence officers, influence agents, forgeries, 
and press placements to disparage candidates 
perceived as hostile to the Kremlin, according 
to a former KGB archivist.
 
 
Since the Cold War,
 
Russian intelligence efforts 
related to US elections have p
rimarily focused on 
foreign intelligence collection. 
 
For decades, 
Russian and Soviet intelligence services have 
sought to collect insider information from US 
political parties that could help Russian leaders 

priorities.

Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (

Kremlin's TV Seeks To Influence P
olitics, Fuel Discontent in US
*
 
RT America TV, a Kremlin
-
financed channel operated from within the United States, has subs
tantially 
expanded its repertoire of programming that highlights criticism of alleged US shortcomings in democracy 
and civil liberties.  The rapid expansion of RT's operations and budget and recent candid statements by RT's 
leadership point to the channel'
s importance to the Kremlin as a messaging tool and indicate a Kremlin
-
directed campaign to undermine faith in the US Government and fuel political protest.  The Kremlin has 
committed significant resources to expanding the channel's reach, particularly its
 
social media footprint.  A 
reliable UK report states that RT recently was the most
-
watched foreign news channel in the UK.  RT 
America has positioned itself as a domestic US channel and has deliberately sought to obscure any legal ties 
to the Russian Gove
rnment.  
 
In the 
runup
 
to the 2012 US presidential election in November, English
-
language channel RT America 
--
 
created and financed by the Russian Government
 
and part of Russian Government
-
sponsored RT TV (see 
textbox 1) 
--
 
intensified its usually critical coverage of the United States.  The channel portrayed the US 
electoral process as undemocratic and featured calls by US protesters for the public to rise up 
and "take 
this government back."  
 

 
RT introduced two new shows 
--
 
"Breaking 
the Set" on 4 September and "Truthseeker" 
on 2 November 
--
 
both overwhelmingly 
focused on criticism of US and Western 
governments as well as the promotion of 
radical discontent.  
 

 
From August to November 2012, RT ran 
numerous reports on alleged US election 
fraud and voting machine vulnerabilities, 
contending th
at US election results cannot 
be trusted and do not reflect the popular 
will.    
 

 
In an effort to highlight the alleged "lack of 
democracy" in the United States, RT 
broadcast, hosted, and advertised third
-
party candidate debates and ran reporting supportiv
e of the political agenda of these candidates.  
The RT hosts asserted that the US two
-
party system does not represent the views of at least one
-
third 
of the population and is a "sham."

RT aired a docume
ntary about the Occupy 
Wall Street movement on 1, 2, and 
 
4 November.  RT framed the movement as a 
fight against "the ruling class" and described 
the current US political system as corrupt and 
dominated by corporations.  RT advertising 
for the documentary f
eatured Occupy 
movement calls to "take back" the 
government.  The documentary claimed that 
the US system cannot be changed 
democratically, but only through "revolution." 
After the 6 November US presidential 
election, RT aired a documentary called 
"Cultures
 
of Protest," about active and often 
violent political resistance  (RT, 1
-
 
10 November).
 
RT Conducts Strategic Messaging for Russian Government
 
RT's criticism of the US election was the latest facet of its broader and longer
-
standing anti
-
US messaging 
likely aimed at undermining viewers' trust in US democratic procedures and undercutting US criticism of 
Russia's political system.  RT Editor in Chief Margarita Simonyan recently declared that the United States 
itself lacks democracy and that it has "no mo
ral right to teach the rest of the world" (
Kommersant
, 
 
6 November).
 

 
Simonyan has characterized RT's coverage of 
the Occupy 
Wall Street movement as 
"information warfare" that is aimed at 
promoting popular dissatisfaction with the US 
Government.  RT created a 
Facebook 
app to 
connect Occupy Wall Street protesters via 
social media.  In addition, RT featured its own 
hosts in Occupy
 
rallies ("Minaev Live," 10 April; 
RT, 2, 12 June).  
 

 
RT's reports often characterize the United 
States as a "surveillance state" and allege 
widespread infringements of civil liberties, 
police brutality, and drone use (RT, 24, 
 
28 October, 1
-
10 November).  
 
 

 
RT has also focused on criticism of the US 
economic system, US currency policy, alleged 
Wall Street greed, and the US national debt.  Some of RT's hosts have compared the United States to 
Imperial Rome and have predicted that government corruption and "cor
porate greed" will lead to US 
financial collapse (RT, 31 October, 4 November).

RT broadcasts support for other Russian interests in areas such as foreign and energy policy.
 

 
RT runs anti
-
fracking programming
, 
highlighting environmental issues and the 
impacts on public health.  This is likely 
reflective of the Russian Government's 
concern about the impact of fracking and 
US natural gas production on the global 
energy market and the potential challenges 
to Gazp
rom's profitability (5 October).
 

 
RT is a leading media voice opposing 
Western intervention in the Syrian conflict 
and blaming the West for waging 
"information wars" against the Syrian 
Government (RT, 10 October
-
9 November).  
 

 
In an earlier example of RT's 
messaging in 
support of the Russian Government, during the Georgia
-
Russia military conflict the channel accused 
Georgians of killing civilians and organizing a genocide of the Ossetian people.  According to 
Simonyan, when "the Ministry of Defense was at wa
r with Georgia," RT was "waging an information 
war against the entire Western world" (
Kommersant
, 11 July).
 
In recent interviews, RT's leadership has candidly acknowledged its mission to expand its US audience and 
to expose it to Kremlin messaging.  Howeve
r, the leadership rejected claims that RT interferes in US 
domestic affairs. 
 

 
Simonyan claimed in popular arts magazine 
Afisha
 
on 3 October: 
"It is important to have a channel 
that people get used to, and then, when needed, you show them what you need to 
show.  In some 
sense, not having our own foreign broadcasting is the same as not having a ministry of defense.  
When there is no war, it looks like we don't need it.  However, when there is a war, it is critical."
 

 
According to Simonyan, "the word 'propagan
da' has a very negative connotation, but indeed, there is 
not a single international foreign TV channel that is doing something other than promotion of the 
values of the country that it is broadcasting from."  She added that "when Russia is at war, we are,
 
of 
course, on Russia's side" (
Afisha
, 3 October; 
Kommersant
, 4 July). 
 

 
TV
-
Novosti director Nikolov said on 4 October to the Association of Cable Television that RT builds on 
worldwide demand for "an alternative view of the entire world."  Simonyan asserte
d on 3 October in 
Afisha
 
that RT's goal is "to make an alternative channel that shares information unavailable elsewhere" 
in order to "conquer the audience" and expose it to Russian state messaging (
Afisha
, 3 October; 
Kommersant
, 4 July).  
 

 
On 26 May, Simo
nyan tweeted with irony:  "Ambassador McFaul hints that our channel is interference 
with US domestic affairs.  And we, sinful souls, were thinking that it is freedom of speech."

RT Leadership Closely Tied to, Controlled by Kremlin
 
RT Editor in Chief Marg
arita Simonyan has close ties to top Russian Government officials, especially 
Presidential Administration Deputy Chief of Staff Aleksey Gromov, who reportedly manages political TV 
coverage in Russia and is one of the founders of RT.
 

 
Simonyan has claimed that Gromov 
shielded her from other officials and th
eir 
requests to air certain reports. 
 
Russian 
media consider Simonyan to be Gromov's 
protege (
Kommersant
, 4 July; Dozhd TV, 
11 July). 
 

 
Simonyan replaced Gromov 
on state
-
owned Channel One's Board of Directors.  
Government officials, including Gromov 
and Put
in's Press Secretary Peskov were 
involved in creating RT and appointing 
Simonyan (
Afisha
, 3 October).
 

 
According to Simonyan, Gromov oversees 
political coverage on TV, and he has 
periodic meetings with media managers 
where he shares classified information 
a
nd discusses their coverage plans.  Some 
opposition journalists, including Andrey 
Loshak, claim that he also ordered media 
attacks on opposition figures 
(
Kommersant
, 11 July).
 
The Kremlin staffs RT and closely supervises 
RT's coverage, recruiting people wh
o can 
convey Russian strategic messaging because of their ideological beliefs.
 

 
The head of RT's Arabic
-
language service, Aydar Aganin, was rotated from the diplomatic service to 
manage RT's Arabic
-
language expansion, suggesting a close relationship between
 
RT and Russia's 
foreign policy apparatus.  RT's London Bureau is managed by Darya Pushkova, the daughter of 
Aleksey Pushkov, the current chair of the Duma Russian Foreign Affairs Committee and a former 
Gorbachev speechwriter (
DXB
, 26 March 2009; 
MK.ru
, 13 March 2006). 
 

 
According to Simonyan, the Russian Government sets rating and viewership requirements for RT and, 
"since RT receives budget from the state, it must complete tasks given by the state."  According to 
Nikolov, RT news stories are written an
d edited "to become news" exclusively in RT's Moscow office 
(Dozhd TV, 11 July; 
AKT
, 4 October). 
 

 
In her interview with pro
-
Kremlin journalist Sergey Minaev, Simonyan complimented RT staff in the 
United States for passionately defending Russian positions o
n the air and in social media.  Simonyan 

Twitter
, 
and when giving interviews, how they defend the positions that we stand on!" ("Minaev Live,"

Simonyan shows RT 
facilities to then Prime Minister 
Putin.  Simonyan was on Putin's 2012 presidential 
election campaign staff in Moscow (

RT 
Focus
es
 
on Social Media, Building Audience
 
RT aggressively advertises its social media accounts and has a significant and fast
-
growing social media 
footprint.  In line with its efforts to present itself as anti
-
mainstream and to provide viewers alternative
 
news content, RT is making its social media operations a top priority, both to avoid broadcast TV 
regulations and to expand its overall audience. 
 

 
According to RT management, RT's website receives at least 500,000 unique viewers every day. 
 
Since 
its ince
ption in 2005, RT videos received more than 800 million views on 
YouTube
 
(1 million views per 
day), which is the highest among news outlets (see graphics for comparison with other news 
channels) (
AKT
, 4 October).
 

 
According to Simonyan, the TV audience worl
dwide is losing trust in traditional TV broadcasts and 
stations, while the popularity of "alternative channels" like RT or Al Jazeera grows.  RT markets itself as 
an "alternative channel" that is available via the Internet everywhere in the world, and it e
ncourages 
interaction and social 
networking (
Kommersant
, 29 September). 
 

 
According to Simonyan, RT uses social media to expand the reach of its political reporting and uses 
well
-
trained people to monitor public opinion in social media 
commentaries (
Kommers
ant
, 
 
29 September).
 

 
According to Nikolov, RT requires its hosts to have social media accounts, in part because social 
media allows the distribution of content that would not be allowed on television (
Newreporter.org
, 
 
11 October). 
 

 
Simonyan claimed in her 3
 
October interview to independent TV channel Dozhd that Occupy Wall 
Street coverage gave RT a significant audience boost.
 
The Kremlin spends $190 million a year on the distribution and dissemination of RT programming, 
focusing on hotels and satellite, t
errestrial, and cable broadcasting.  The Kremlin is rapidly expanding RT's 
availability around the world and giving it a reach comparable to channels such as Al Jazeera English.  
According to Simonyan, the United Kingdom and the United States are RT's most
 
successful markets.   RT 
does not, however, publish audience information. 
 

 
According to market research company Nielsen, RT had the most rapid growth (40
 
percent) among all 
international news channels in the United States over the past year
 
(2012)
.  Its a
udience in New York 
tripled and in Washington DC grew by 60% (
Kommersant
, 4 July).
 

 
RT claims that it is surpassing Al Jazeera in viewership in New York and Washington DC (
BARB
, 
 
20 November; RT, 21 November).  
 

 
RT states on its website that it can reach mor
e than 550 million people worldwide and 85 million 
people in the United States; however, it does not publicize its actual US audience numbers (RT, 
 
10 December).

Formal Disassociation From Kremlin Facilitates RT US Messaging
 
RT America formally disassociate
s itself from the Russian Government by using a Moscow
-
based 
autonomous nonprofit organization to finance its US operations.  According to RT's leadership, this 
structure was set up to avoid the Foreign Agents Registration Act and to facilitate licensing a
broad.  In 
addition, RT rebranded itself in 2008 to deemphasize its Russian origin.
 

 
According to Simonyan, RT America 
differs from other Russian state institutions in terms of 
ownership, but not in terms of financing.
 
 
To disassociate RT from the Russian G
overnment, the 
federal news agency RIA Novosti established a subsidiary autonomous nonprofit organization, TV
-
Novosti, using the formal independence of this company to establish and finance RT worldwide 
(Dozhd TV, 11 July).
 

 
Nikolov claimed that RT is an 
"autonomous noncommercial entity," which is "well received by foreign 
regulators" and "simplifies getting a license."  Simonyan said that RT America is not a "foreign agent" 
according to US law because it uses a US commercial organization for its broadcast
s (
AKT,
 
4 October; 
Dozhd TV, 11 July).  
 

 
Simonyan observed that RT's original Russia
-
centric news reporting did not generate sufficient 
audience, so RT switched to covering interna
tional and US domestic affairs 
and removed the words 
"Russia Today" from the
 
logo "to stop scaring away the audience" (
Afisha
, 18 October; 
Kommersant
, 
 
4 July). 
 

 
RT hires or makes contractual agreements with Westerners with views that fit its agenda and airs them 
on RT.  Simonyan said on the pro
-
Kremlin show "Minaev Live" on 10 Apr
il that RT has enough 
audience and money to be able to choose its hosts, and it chooses the hosts that "think like us," "are 
interested in working in the anti
-
mainstream," and defend RT's beliefs on social media.  Some hosts 
and journalists do not present 
themselves as associated with RT when interviewing people, and many 
of them have affiliations to other media and activist organizations in the United States ("Minaev Live," 
10 April).
