The 
Mission
 
 
Goal
 
and Objectives
 
The overall goal of the Joint Mission was to rapidly inform national (China) and international 
planning on next steps in the response to the ongoing outbreak of 
the novel coronavirus 
disease (
COVID
-
19
1
)
 
and on next steps in 
re
a
diness and 
pr
eparedness for 
geographic 
areas 
not yet affected.
 
The
 
major objectives o
f the Joint Mission 
we
re as follows:
 

 
To enhance understanding of the evolving COVID
-
19 outbreak in China and the 
nature and impact of ongoing containment measures;
 

 
To share knowledge on COVID
-
19 response and preparedness measures being 
implemented in countries affected by or at risk of importations of 
COVID
-
19
;
 

 
To generate recommendations for adjusting COVID
-
19 containment and response 
measures in China and internati
onally; and
 

 
To establish priorities for a collaborative programme of work
,
 
research and 
development to address critical gaps in knowledge and response and 
readiness 
tools 
and activities.
 
 
Members & Method of Work
 
The Joint Mission consisted of 
25
 
national 
and international experts from China, Germany, 
Japan, Korea, 
Nigeria, 
Russia, Singapore, 
the 
United States of America and the World Health 
Organization
 
(WHO)
.  The Joint Mission was headed by Dr Bruce Aylward of 
WHO
 
and Dr 
Wannian
 

ublic of China.  The full list of members and their 
affiliations is available in Annex 
A
.
  
The Joint Mission was implemented over a 
9
-
day period 
from 16
-
2
4
 
February 2020
.  The schedule of work is available in Annex B
.
 
The Joint Mission began with a detaile
d workshop with representatives of all of the principal 
ministries that are leading and/or contributing to the response in China through the 
National 
Prevention and Control Task Force.  A series of in
-
depth meetings were then 
conducted with national level 
institutions responsible for the management, implementation 
and evaluation of 
the 
response, particularly the National Health Commission and the China 
Center
s
 
for Disease Control
 
and Prevention (C
hina 
CDC)
.  To gain first
-
hand knowledge on 
the field level implementation and impact of the national 
and local 
response strategy, under 
a range of epidemiologic and provincial contexts, visits were conducted to Beijing 
Municipality and the provinces of Sichuan (Ch
engdu), 
Guangdong 
(Guangzhou, Shenzhen) 
and Hubei (Wuhan).  The field visits included community centers
 
and health 
clinics, 
country/district hospitals, COVID
-
19 designated hospitals, transportations hubs (air, rail, 
road), 
a wet market, 
pharmaceutical and 
personal protective equipment (
PPE
)
 
stocks 
warehouses
, 
research institutions, provincial health commissions, and 
local 
Centers for

In the Chinese version of this report, COVID
-
19 is referred to throughout as novel coronavirus pneumonia or 
NCP, the term by which COVID
-
19 is most widely known in the 

 
  
4
 
Disease Control
 
(provincial and prefecture)
.  During these visits, the team had detailed 
discussion and consultations with Pr
ovincial Governors, municipal Mayors, their emergency 
operations teams, senior scientists, frontline clinical
,
 
public health 
and community workers
, 
and community neighbourhood administrators
.  The Joint Mission concluded with working 
sessions to consolidat
e findings, generate conclusions and propose suggested actions.
 
To achieve its goal, the Joint Mission gave particular focus to addressing
 
key questions
 
related to the natural history and severity of COVID
-
19, the transmission dynamics of the 
COVID
-
19 viru
s 
in different settings, and the impact of ongoing response measures in areas 
of high (community level), moderate (clusters) and low (sporadic cases
 
or no cases
) 
transmission.
 
The 
findings in 

review of national 
and local 
governmental reports, 
discussions
 
on control and prevention measures with national and 
local experts and response teams, and observations 
made and insights gained
 
during site 
visits
.  The figures
 
have been produced using 
information and data coll
ected 
during site 
visits and with the agreement of the relevant
 
groups
. 
 
R
eferences 
are available 
for any 
information in this report 
that 
ha
s
 
already 
been 
published 
in 
journals
.
 
The final report of the Joint Mission was submitted on 2
8
 
February 2020.

Major findings
 
 
The major findings are described in 
six
 
sections: the virus, the outbreak, transmission
 
dynamics
, 
disease progression
 
and 
severity
,
 
the China response 
and knowledge gaps.  More 
detailed descriptions of technical findings are provided in An
nex C.
 
 
The virus
 
 
On 30 Dec
ember
 
2019, three bronchoalveolar lavage samples were collected from 
a patient 
with pneumonia of unknown etiology 

 
a surveillance definition established following the 
SARS outbreak of 2002
-
2003 

 
in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital
.
 
 
R
eal

assay
s
 
on these samples were positive 
for pan
-
Betacoronavirus.
 
 
Using 
Illumina and nanopore 
sequencing
,
 
the
 
whole genome sequences 
of 
the 
virus 
were acquired. Bioinf
or
matic 
analys
e
s indicated that the 
virus
 
had features typical of the
 
coronavirus family and belong
ed 
to
 
the Betacoronavirus 2B lineage. 
 
Alignment of 
the 
full

length genome sequence of 
the 
COVID
-
19 virus
 
and other available genomes of Betacoronavirus showed the closest 
relationship 
was 
with 
the b
at SARS
-
like coronavirus 
strain BatCov RaTG13
,
 
identity 96%.
 
 
 
Virus isolation was 
conduct
ed with various cell lines, such as human airway epithelial cells, 
Vero E6, 
and 
Huh
-
7. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed 96 hours after inoculation. 
Typical crown
-
like particles were obs
erved under transmission electron microscope (TEM) 
with negative staining. 
 
The cellular infectivity of the isolated viruses could be completely 
neutralized by the sera 
collected 
from convalescent patients.

old male patient
 
from Wuha
n
 
were taken from
 
the
 
lung, liver, and heart. 
 
Histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage 
with cellular fibromyxoid exudates. 
 
The lung showed evident desquamation of 
pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation, indicating acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS). 
 
Lung tissue also displayed cellular 
and 
fibromyxoi
d 
exudat
ion,
 
desquamation of pneumocy
tes
 
and pulmonary oedema
. 
 
In
terstitial mononuclear 
inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, were seen in both lungs.
 
 
Multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterized by large 
nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli wer

reported 
in 
China
. 
Reported cases are based on the National Reporting System (NRS) between the

National and Provincial Health Commissions.
 
 
The NRS 
issues daily reports of newly 
recorded confirmed cases, deaths, suspect
ed cases,
 
and contacts.  A daily 
repo
rt 
is provided 
by each province at 
0300hr 
in which they 
report cases from 
the previous day. 
 
 
The epidemic curves presented 
in Figures 2 and 3 

Infectious Disease Information System (IDIS), which requires each COVID
-
19 
case to be 
reported electronically by the responsible doctor as soon as a case has been diagnosed.
 
 
It 
includes cases that are reported as 
asymptomatic and data are updated in real time. 
 
Individual case reporting forms are downloaded after 2400hr daily
.
 
 
Epidemiologic curves 
for Wuhan, Hubei (outside of Wuhan), China (outside Hubei) and China by symptom onset

, the median age 
is 
51
 
years 
(range

years old
; IQR 39
-
63 years old
) with the majority of cases 
(
77.8%
)
 
aged
 
between 30

69 years
.  Among reported cases, 51.

% are male, 
77.
0
% 
are from
 
Hubei
 
and 
2
1.6
% are 
farmers or laborer
s

.
 
 
Zoonotic origins
 
 
COVID
-
19 is a zoonotic virus.
 
 
From phylogenetics 
analyses 
undertaken 
with available full 
genome 
sequences
, bats appear to be the reservoir of COVID
-
19 
virus
, but t
he 
intermediate 
host(s) 
has not 
yet 
been identified
. 
 
However, t
hree important 
areas of work
 
are
 
already
 
underway
 
in China 
to inform 
our understanding
 
of 
the 
zoonotic
 
origin of this outbreak.  
These include early investigations of cases with symptom onset in 
Wuhan 
throughout
 
December 2019, 
environmental 
samp
ling
 
from
 
the 
Huanan Wholesale Seafood M
arket 
and 
other area markets
, and 
the collection
 
of 
detailed records o
n
 
t
he source
 
and 
type 
of 
wildlife
 
species 
sold 
at the
 
Huanan
 
market
 
and 
the 
destination of th
ose
 
animals after the market 
was closed
.
 
 
Routes of 
transmission 
 
COVID
-
19 is transmitted via 
droplet
s and fomites
 
during
 
close 
unprotected 
contact
 
between 
an 
infector and infectee
. 
 
Airborne spread 
has not 
been reported for COVID
-
19
 
and it 
is 
not 
believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence
;
 
however, it 
can 
be envis
a
ged
 
i
f certain
 
aerosol
-
generating procedures
 
are conducted 
in healt
h care facilities
. 
 
Fecal
 
shedding has been demonstrated from 
some 
patients
, and viable virus has been 
identified in a 
limited number of 
case reports
.
 
 
However, 
the fecal
-
oral route does not 
appear to be a driver of COVID
-
19 transmission
;
 
its 
role and sign
ificance 
for COVID
-
19 
remains to be determined. 
 
Viral shedding is discussed in the Technical Findings (Annex C)
.
 
 
Household 
transmission 
 
In China, h
uman
-
to
-
human t
ransmission 
of the COVID
-
19 virus 
is largely occurring in 
families.  
T
he Joint 
M
ission 
received
 
detailed information 
from 
the investigation of clusters 
and some 
household transmission studies
, which are ongoing in a number of Provinces
. 
 
Among 
344
 
clusters involving 
1308
 
cases
 
(out of a total 1836 cases reported) 
in
 
Guangdong 
Provinc
e and 
Si
chuan Province
, 
most 
clusters 
(
78%
-
85
%)
 
have 
occurred 
in famil
ies.
 
 
Household transmission studies are 
currently 
underway, but 
preliminary studies ongoing in 
Guangdong estimate 
the 
secondary attack rate in household
s
 
ranges from 
3
-
10%.
 
 
Contact Tracing
 
Chi
na has 
a 
policy of 
meticulous 
case and contact identification for COVID
-
19. 
 
For example, 
i
n Wuhan more than 18
00 teams of epidemiologists
, with a minimum of
 
5 people/team, 
are 
tracing tens of thousands of contacts a day. 
 
Contact follow up is 
painstaking
, with a high 
percentage 
of identified close contacts complet
ing
 
medical observation
.  Between 1
%
 
and
 
5%
 
of contacts
 
were 
subsequently 
laboratory confirmed
 
cases of COVID
-
19
, depending on 
location
.
  
For example:
 

 
As of 
17 February
, in Shenzhen City, among 
2
842
 
identified close contacts, 2842 
(
100
%) were traced and 2240 (72%) 
have 
completed medical observation
.  Among 
the close contacts
, 88 (2.8%) were 
found to be infected with COVID
-
19
.
 
  
9
 

 
As of 
17 
Feb
ruary
, in Sichuan Province, among 25493 identified close con
tacts, 
25347 (99%) were traced and 23178 (91%) 
have 
completed medical observation
.  
Among the close contacts, 
0.9% were
 
found to be infected with COVID
-
19
. 
 

 
As of 
20 February
, in Guangdong Province, among 9939 identified close contacts, 
9939 (100%) were tr
aced and 7765 (78%) 
have 
completed medical observation
.
 
 
Among the close contacts, 
479 (4.8%) were 
found to be infected with COVID
-
19
. 
 
 
Testing at fever clinics and from routine ILI/SARI surveillance
 
The Joint Mission 
systematically 
enquired about testing for COVID
-
19 from routine 
respiratory disease surveillance systems 
to explore if COVID
-
19 is circulating 
more broadly 
and undetected 
in the community 
in China
.  These 
systems could 
includ
e
 
RT
-
PCR testing of 
COVID
-
19 
virus in 
influenz
a
-
like
-
illness (ILI) and sever
e
 
acute respiratory infection (SARI) 
surveillance
 
systems
, as well as 
testing 
of 
results 
among all 
visit
ors
 
to fever clinics.
 
 
In Wuhan, COVID
-
19 testing of ILI 
samples 
(20 
per 
week) in November
 
and
 
December 
2019 
and 
in 
the fi
rst two weeks 
of 
January 
2020 
found 
no positive results in the 2019 samples, 
1 
adult positive 
in 
the first week of Ja
nuary
, and 3 adults positive 
in 
the second week of 
January; all children tested were negative for COVID
-
19
 
although a number were positive 
for 
influenza
. 
 
In Guangdong, 
from 
1
-
14 January, only 1 of more than 15000 ILI/SARI samples 
tested positive for 
the 
COVID
-
19
 
virus
.  In one hospital in Beijing, there were no COVID
-
19 
positive samples among 1910 collected from 28 January 
2019 
to 13 Februar
y
 
2020
.  In 
a 
hospital in Shenz
h
en, 0/40 ILI samples were positive for COVID
-
19.
 
 
 
Withi
n 
the 
f
ever clinics
 
in Guangdong
, the percent
age
 
of samples that tested 
positive 
for 
the 
COVID
-
19 
virus 
has decreased 
over time 
from
 
a peak of 
0
.47
%
 
positive on 30 January 
to 
0.0
2
% on 16 February.  Overall in Guangdong, 0.14% of approximately 3
2
0,000 
fever clinic 
screenings were positive for COVID
-
19.
  
 
 
Susceptibility
 
As 
COVID
-
19
 
is a 
newly identified 
pathogen, 
there is no known 
pre
-
existing immunity 
in 
humans.
 
 
B
ased on the epidemiologic characteristics observed so far
 
in China
, everyone 
is 
assumed 
to be 
susceptible, although 
there may be risk factors increasing susceptibility to 
infection
.
  
This requires further study, as well as 
to know 
whether 
ther
e is neutralising 
immunity after infection. 
 
 
The t
ransmission dynamics
 
 
Inferring 
from Figures 2 and 3
,
 
and based on our observations
 
at the national and 
provincial/municipal levels
 
during the
 
Joint
 
Mission, we summarize and interpret the 
transmission dynamics of COVID
-
19 thus far.
 
 
It is important to note that t
ransmission 
dynamics of any outbreak 
are
 
inherently contextual. 
 
For COVID
-
19, we observe 
four
 
major 
types of transmission dynamics during t
he epidemic growth phase
 
and in the post
-
control 
period
,
 
and highlight what is known about transmission in children
, as follows:
 
 
  
10
 
Transmission in 
Wuhan 
 
E
arly cases identified in Wuhan
 
are believed to be have acquired infection from a zoonotic 
source as ma
ny
 
reported visiting or working in the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market
. 
 
As 
of 25 February, 
an animal source has not yet been identified. 
 
 
At some point early in the outbreak, some cases
 
generated 
human
-
to
-
human 
transmission 
chains that seeded the subsequ
ent community outbreak prior to the implementation of 
the 
comprehensive 
control measures
 
that were 
rolled out
 
in Wuhan
. 
 
The dynamics likely 
approximated mass action and radiated from Wuhan to 
other 
parts of
 
Hubei province
 
and 
China
,
 
which explains a relatively high 
R
0
 
of 
2
-
2.5
.

s imposed since 23 
January 2020 has effectively prevented further exportation of infected individuals to the 
rest of the country.
 
 
 
Transmission 
in 
Hubei, other than Wuhan
 
In the prefectures immediately adjoining Wuhan (Xiaogan, Huanggang, Jingzhou and Ezhou), 
transmission is less intense
. 
 
For other prefectures, due to 
fewer 
transport links and human 
mobility flows with Wuhan, the dynamics are mor
e closely aligned with those observed in 
the other areas of the country.
 
 
Within Hubei, the implementation of control measures 
(including social distancing) has reduced the community force of infection, resulting in the 
progressively lower incident reporte
d case counts.
 
 
Transmission in 
China
 
outside of Hubei
 
G

population movement during the Chinese New 
Year (
chunyun
)
, infected individuals quickly spread throughout the country, and were 
particularly concentrated in cities with the highest volume 
of 
traffic with Wuhan. 
 
Some of 
these imported seeds generated limited 
human
-
to
-
human 
transmission chains
 
at their 
destinatio
n
.
 
 
 
Given the Wuhan/Hubei experience, a 
comprehensive
 
set of interventions, including 
aggressive case and contact identification, isolation and management and 
extreme social 
distancing, have been implemented to interrupt the chains of transmission nationwide. 
 
To 
date, m
ost of the recorded cases were imported from or had direct links to Wuhan/Hubei. 
Community transmission has been very limited. 
 
Most locally gen
erated cases have been 
clustered, the majority of which 
have occurred 
in households
, as summarized above
. 
 
 
Of note, the highly clustered nature of local transmission may explain a relatively high 
R
0
 
(2
-
2.5) in the absence of interventions and low confirme
d case counts with intense quarantine 
and social distancing measures. 
 
 
Special settings 
 
We note 
that 
instances of transmission
 
have occurred 
within health care settings prisons
 
and other 
closed 
settings
.
 
 
A
t the pres
e
nt time, 
it is not clear what role these settings and 
groups play in transmission. 
 
However, t
hey do not appear to be major drivers of the 
overall 
epidemic dynamics.
 
 
Specifically
, we note
:
 
 
  
11
 
(a)
 
Transmission in h
ealth care settings
 
and among health care 
workers
 
(HCW)
 

 
The 
Joint Mission discussed nosocomial infection in all locations 
visited 
during the 
Mission. 
 
As of 20 February
 
2020
, t
here 
were
 
2,055
 
COVID
-
19 
laboratory
-
confirmed 
cases reported among 
HCW
 
from 476 hospitals across China. 
 
The majority of 
HCW 
cases (
88
%) were 
reported 
from Hubei.
 
 
 
Remarkably, m
ore than 40,000 HCW have been deployed from other areas 
of
 
China 
to support the response
 
in Wuhan
. 
 
N
otwithstanding discrete 
and limited 
instances 
of nosocomial 
outbreaks (e
.
g
.
 
a nosocomial outbreak involving 15 
HCW
 
in Wuhan), 
transmission 
within
 
health care settings and amongst health care workers does not 
appear to 
be
 
a major 
transmission 
feature of COVID
-
19 in Chin
a. 
 
The Joint Mission 
learned that, among the HCW infections, 
most
 
were identified early in the ou
tbreak 
in Wuhan 
when supplies and 
experience with 
the
 
new
 
disease was lower.  
Additionally, investigations among HCW suggest that many 
may have been infected 
within the household rather than in a health care s
e
tting. 
 
Outside of Hubei, health 
care worker infections have been 
less frequent 
(
i.
e. 
246 of the total 2055 HCW
 
cases
).  W
hen exposure 
was 
investigated 
in
 
these limited cases, the exposure 
for 
most 
was 
reported to have 
be
en
 
traced back
 
to a confirmed case in 
a hou
sehold
. 
 
 
The Joint Team noted th
at
 
attention to the
 
prevention of
 
infection in health care 
worker
s
 
is
 
of paramount importance
 
in China
.
 
 
Surveillance among health care 
workers identified factors early in the outbreak that placed HCW at 
higher
 
risk of 
infection, 
and 
this information 
has been used 
to 
modify policies to 
improve 
protect
ion of
 
HCW
. 
 
 
(b)
 
Transmission in c
losed settings
 

 
T
here have been reports of COVID
-
19 
transmission
 
in 
prisons
 
(Hubei, Shandong, 
and 
Zhejiang, China
), 
hospitals (as ab
ove)
 
and in a long
-
term living facility
.  The close proximity
 
and
 
contact 
among people in these settings 
and 
the 
potential for environmental contamination are 
important 
factors
,
 
which 
could amplify transmission
.
 
 
Transmission in these settings warrants 
further study.
 
 
Children
 
Data o
n
 
individuals 
aged 
1
8
 
years old and under suggest that there 
is a 
relatively 
low attack 
rate in this age group 
(2.4% of all reported cases).  
Within Wuhan, among testing of ILI
 
samples
, no children were positive in November
 
a
nd
 
December 
of 
2019 
and 
in 
the first two 
weeks of January
 
2020
. 
 
From available data
,
 
and in the absence of 
results from 
serologic 
studies, it is not possible to determine 
the extent of infection among children, 
what role 
children play in transmission, 
whether children are less susceptible or 
if they 
present 
differently
 
clinically
 
(i.e. generally milder presentations). 
 
T
he Joint Mission learned that
 
infected 
children have largely been identified through contact tracing in households
 
of 
adults
.
 
 
Of 
note
,
 
people interviewed by the Joint Mission 
T
eam could not recall episodes in 
which transmission occurred from a child to an adult.

Symptoms of COVID
-
19 are non
-
specific and 
the disease presentation can 
range from no 
symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and death.
 
 
As of 20 February 
2020 
and 
  
12
 
based on 
55924 
laboratory confirmed cases, 
t
ypical 
signs and symptoms
 
include
:
 
fever 
(87.9%), 
dry 
cough (67.7%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath 
(18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%), 
myalgia
 
or arthralgia (14.8%), chi
lls
 
(11.4%), 
nausea or vomiting (5.0%), 
nasal congestion (4.8%), diarrhea (3.7%), and hemoptysi
s (0.9%), 
and conjunctival congestion (0.8%).
 
 
People with COVID
-
19 generally develop signs and symptoms
,
 
including mild respiratory 
symptoms and fever, on 
an 
average 
of 
5
-
6 days after infection (mean incubation period 5
-
6 
days, range 1
-
14 days).  
 
 
Most people infected with COVID
-
19 virus have 
mild disease 
and recover. 
 
A
pproximately 
80% of 
laboratory confirmed
 
patients have had 
mild
 
to moderate
 
disease
, which include
s
 
non
-
pneumonia and pneumonia
 
cases
, 
13.8
% have 
severe disease 
(
dyspnea, respiratory 
frequency 

30/minute, blood oxygen saturation
 

93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung 
infiltrates >50% 
of the lung field 
within 24
-
48 hours) and 
6.1
% are 
critical 
(respiratory 
failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/fa
ilure). 
 
Asymptomatic infection
 
has been reported, but 
the majority of the relatively rare
 
cases who are asymptomatic on 
the date of 
identification/
report 
went
 
on to
 
develop 
disease.  The proportion of 
truly 
asymptomatic infections is unclear
 
but appears
 
to be
 
relatively 
rare
 
and does not appear to 
be a major driver of transmission
. 
 
 
Individuals at 
highest risk
 
for severe disease
 
and death include people 
aged 
over 60 years 
and those with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascula
r 
disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer.  Disease 
in
 
children
 
appears to be 
relatively 
rare and mild with approximately 2
.4
% of the total reported cases 
reported 
amongst 
individuals
 
aged 
under 19 years
. 
 
A
 
very small proportion of 
those
 
aged under 19 years 
have 
developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%).
 
 
As of 
20
 
February

924
 
laboratory 
confirmed 
cases

%)
 
(
note: 
at least some of whom were identified using a case definition that 
included pulmonary disease). 
 
The overall 
CFR
 
varies by location
 
and intensity of 
transmission 
(
i.e. 
5.8
%
 
in 
Wuhan
 
vs.
 
0.
7
%
 
in other areas in China)
.  
In China, the overall 
CFR 
was higher i
n the early stages of the outbreak 
(
17
.
3
% for cases with symptom onset 
from 1
-
10 January
) 
and has reduced over time
 
to 0.7% for patients with symptom onset after 1 
February
 
(
Figure 
4
)
. 
 
The Joint Mission noted that the standard of care has evolved over the
 
course of the outbreak.
 
 
Mortality increases with age, with the highest mortality among people over 80 years 
of age
 
(CFR 21.9%).  
The CFR
 
is higher among males compared to females (
4.7
% v
s. 2.8
%). 
 
By 
occupation, patients who reported being retirees had the highest 
CFR
 
at 
8.9
%
.  
While 
patients who reported no comorbid conditions had a 
CFR
 
of 
1.4
%, patients with comorbid 
conditions had much higher rates
: 13.2
% for those with cardiovascular disease, 
9.
2
% for 
diabetes, 
8.4% for hypertension, 8.0
% for chronic respiratory disease, and 
7.6
% for cancer.

Data on the 
progression of disease
 
is available from a 
limited number

Based on available information, t

data, the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild 
cases is approximately 2 weeks and 
is
 
3

disease. 
 
Preliminary data suggests that the time period 
from

severe 
disease, including hypoxia
,
 
is 1 week. 
 
Among patients who have died, the time from

Encouragingly, a report on 20 February from 
the

suggests that of 125 severe cases identified in Guangdong, 33 (26.4%) have recover
ed and 
been released
 
from hospital
, 
and

The 
China response
 
 
Upon 
the 
detection of a cluster of pneumonia
 
cases of unknown etiology
 
in Wuhan, the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council launched the national emergency response. 
 
A 
Central Leadership Group for Epidemi
c Response
 
and the 
Joint Prevention and Control 
Mechanism
 
of the State Council were established. 
 
General Secretary Xi Jinping personally 
directed and deployed the prevention and control work and requested that the prevention 
and control of the 
COVID
-
19
 
ou
tbreak
 
be 
the top priority of government at all levels. 
 
Prime 
Minister Li Keqiang
 
headed 
the Central Leading Group for Epidemic Response and went to 
Wuhan to inspect
 
and
 
coordinat
e
 
the prevention and control work of relevant departments 
and provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) across the country. 
 
Vice Pr
e
mier 
Sun Chunlan, who has been working on the frontline
s
 
in Wuhan, has led and coordinated 
the frontline prevention 
and control of the outbreak.
 
 
The prevention and control measures have been implemented rapidly
,
 
from the early stages 
in Wuhan and other key areas of Hubei
,
 
to the 
current 
overall national epidemic. 
 
It has 
been undertaken in
 
three 
main 
phases
,
 
with 
t
wo i
mportant events 
defin
ing
 
those 
phases
.
 
 
First, 
COVID
-
19
 
was included in the statutory report of Class B infectious diseases and 
bo
rder
 
health quarantine infectious diseases on
 
20
 
January
 
2020
, which marked the 
transition from the initial partial control 
ap
proach 
to the comprehensive adoption of various 
control measures in accordance with the law
.
 
 
The second event was 
the State Council

issu
ing, 
on 
8 
February
 
2020
,
 
of 
The Notice on Orderly Resuming Production and Resuming 
Production in Enterprises
, which 
indicated
 
that
 

epidemic
 
control work 
had 
entered a stage of overall epidemic prevention and control 
together with the
 
restoration of 
normal social and economic operations.
 
 
The first stage
 
During the 
early
 
stage
 
of the outbreak
, the main s
trategy focused on preventing 
the 
exportation of cases 
from
 
Wuhan and other priority areas of Hubei Province, and preventing 
the 
importation of cases by other provinces
;
 
the overall 
aim 
was 
to 
control the source of 
infection, block transmission and prevent further spread. 
 
The response mechanism was 
initiated with multi
-
sectoral involvement in joint prevention and control
 
measures
. 
 
Wet 
markets were 
closed,
 
and efforts were made to identify the 
zoonotic source
. 
 
Information 
on the
 
epidemic was notified to WHO 
on 3 January
, and
 
w
hole genome sequence
s
 
of 
the 
COVID
-
19 virus 
w
ere
 
shared with WHO
 
on 10 January
.  
Protocols for 
COVID
-
19 
diagnosis and 
  
15
 
treatment, surveillance, epidemiological investigatio
n, management of close contacts
,
 
and 
laboratory testing were 
formulated,
 
and relevant surveillance activities and epidemiological 
investigations conducted. 
 
Diagnostic t
esting kits were developed
,
 
and wildlife and live 
poultry markets were placed under str
ict supervision and control measures.
 
 
The second stage
 
During the second stage
 
of the outbreak
, the main strategy was to reduce the intensity of 
the 
epidemic and 
to 
slow down the increase 
in
 
cases.  In Wuhan and other priority areas of 
Hubei Province, the
 
focus was on active
ly
 
treat
ing
 
patients, reduc
ing
 
deaths
,
 
and preventi
ng
 
exportation
s
.  In other provinces, the focus was on preventi
ng
 
importation
s
, curbing 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
disease 
and 
implementing 
joint prevention and control
 
measures
. 
 
Nationally,
 
w
i
ldlife markets were closed and wildlife captive
-
breeding facilities were 
cordoned off
. 
 
On
 
20
 
January, COVID
-
19 was included in the 
notifiable
 
report of Class B infectious diseases and 
border
 
health quarantine infectious diseases, 
with
 
temperature check
s,
 
health care 
declarations
,
 
and quarantine against 
COVID
-
19 
instituted at 
transportation depots in 
accordance with the law. 
 
On 
23 
January, Wuhan implemented strict traffic restrictions
.
 
 
The 
protocol
s
 
for diagnosis
, 
treatment and epidemic prevention and control 
were
 
improved
;
 
case isolation and treatment 
were
 
strengthened.  
 
 
Measures were taken to ensure
 
that
 
all cases were treated, and close contacts were 
isolated 
and put under 
medical observation.  
Other m
easures i
mplemented included 
the 
extension 
of the Spring Festival holiday, traffic control
s
, and 
the 
control of transportation capacity to 
reduce 
the 
movement of people
;
 
mass gathering activities
 
were 
also 
cancelled
. 
 
Information 
about the epidemic and prevention a
nd control measures was regularly released. 
 
Public risk 
communication
s
 
and health education 
were 
strengthened; allocation of medical supplies 
was coordinated, new hospitals were built, reserve beds were used and relevant premises 
were repurposed to ensure
 
that all cases 
could be 
treated; efforts were made to maintain 
a 
stable supply of commodities and 
their 
prices to ensure 
the 
smooth operation of society.
 
 
The third stage
 
The third stage
 
of the outbreak
 
focused on reducing clusters of cases, thoroughly controlling 
the epidemic, and striking a balance between epidemic prevention and control
,
 
sustainable 
economic and social development, 
the
 
unified command, 
standardized
 
guidance, 
and 
scientific evidence
-
ba
sed policy implementation. 
 
For Wuhan and other priority areas of 
Hubei Province, the focus was on 
patient 
treatment and 
the i
nterruption of transmission, 
with 
an 
emphasis on concrete steps to 
fully 
implement relevant measures 
for the 
testing, 
admitting an
d treating 
of all 
patients.  A risk
-
based prevention and control approach was 
adopted with differentiated prevention and control measures for different regions
 
of the 
country and provinces
. 
 
Relevant measures were strengthened in 
the areas of 
epidemiologic
al investigation, case management and epidemic prevention in high
-
risk public 
places.  
 
 
New technologies were applied such as 
the use of 
big data and artificial intelligence 
(AI) 
to 
strengthen contact tracing and 
the 
management of priority population
s
.  R
elevant health 
insurance policies were promulgated on "health insurance payment, off
-
site settlement, and 
financial compensation".  All provinces provided support to Wuhan and priority areas in 
Hubei Province in an effort to quickly curb the spread of the 
disease
 
and 
provide 
timely 
clinical treatment
. 
 
Pre
-
school preparation was improved, and work resumed in phases and 
  
16
 
batches.  Health and welfare services were provided to returning workers in a targeted and 

one
-
stop

 
manner. 
 
Normal social operation
s
 
are 
being restored
 
in a stepwise fashion
; 
knowledge about disease prevention is being popularized to improve public health literacy 
and skills; 
and a 
comprehensive 
program of 
emergency scientific research is being carried 
out 
to 
develop diagnostics
, 
therapeutics
 
and 
vaccines
,
 
delineat
e
 
the spectrum of
 
the 
disease
,
 
and identify the
 
source of the 
virus
. 
 
 
K
nowledge gaps 
 
 
Since the start of the COVID
-
19 outbreak, there ha
ve
 
been extensive 
attempts to better 
understand the virus and the disease 
in China
.
 
 
It is remarkable how much knowledge about 
a new virus has been gained in 
such 
a short time. 
 
However, 
as with all new diseases, and 
only 7 weeks after this outbreak began, 
key knowledge gaps remain
.  Annex D summarizes 
the 
key unknowns
 
in a number of are
as including the source of infection, pathogenesis and 
virulence of the virus, transmissibility, risk factor
s
 
for infection
 
and disease progression
, 
surveillance, diagnostics, clinical management of severe and critically ill patients, and the 
effectiveness
 
of prevention and control measures. 
 
The t
imely filling 
of 
these knowledge 
gaps is imperative 
to
 
enhanc
e
 
control strategies
.
 
 
III.
 
Assessment
 
 
The Joint Mission drew 
four
 
major conclusions from 
its work in China 
and 
four
 
major 
conclusions 
from its knowledge of the broader global response to 
COVID
-
19
.  
Recommendations are 
offered 
in 
five
 
major areas to inform the ongoing response globally 
and in China.
 
 
The China Response & Next Steps
 
 
1.
 
In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rol
led out 
perhaps 
the most 
ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history.
  
The strategy 
that underpinned this containment effort was initially a national approach that 
promoted universal temperature monitoring
, masking,
 
and hand washi
ng.  However, 
as the outbreak evolved
,
 
and knowledge was gained, a science and risk
-
based 
approach was taken to tailor implementation
.
 
 
S
pecific containment measures 
were 
adjusted 
to the provincial, county and even community context, the capacity of the 
se
tting, and the nature of novel coronavirus transmission there.
 
 
While the fundamental principles of this strategy have been consistent since its launch, 
there has been constant refinement of specific aspects to incorporate new knowledge 
on the novel corona
virus, 
the 
COVID
-
19
 
disease
, and 
COVID
-
19 
containment
,
 
as rapidly 
as 
that knowledge 
has emerged.  The remarkable speed with which Chinese scientists 
and public health experts isolated the causative virus, established diagnostic tools, and 
determined key tr
ansmission parameters
,
 
such as the route of spread and incubation 

the response.
 
 
  
17
 
As striking, has been the uncompromising rigor of strategy application that proved t
o be 
a hallmark in every setting and context where it was examined.  
T
here has 
also 
been a 
relentless focus on improving key performance indicators, for example constantly 
enhancing 
the speed 
of case detection
, 
isolation
 
and early treatment
.
  
T
he 
implementation of these containment measures 
has been 
supported and enabled by the 
innovative and 
aggressive use of cutting edge technologies
, from shifting to online 
medical platforms for routine care and schooling
,
 
to the use of 5G platforms to suppor
t 
rural response operations
.  
 
 
 
2.
 
Achieving 

exceptional coverage 
with and adherence to 
these containment 
measures 
has only been 
possible 
due to 
the 
deep commitment of the Chinese people 
to 
collective 
action in the face of this common threat
.  
At a c
ommunity level this is 
reflected in the remarkable 
solidarity of provinces and 
cities 
in support of the most 
vulnera
ble populations and communities.
 
 
Despite ongoing outbreaks in their own 
areas, Governors and Mayors 
have 
continue
d
 
to send 
thousands of
 
hea
lth care 
workers and tons of vital PPE supplies into 
Hubei province
 
and Wuhan city.
 
 
At the individual level, the Chinese people have reacted to this outbreak with courage 
and conviction.  They have accepted and adhered to the 
starkest
 
of containment 
measu
res 

 
whether the suspension of public gatherings, the month
-

advisories or prohibitions on travel.  Throughout an 
intensive 
9
-
days of site visits across 
China, in frank discussions from the level of local community mobilizers and frontline 
health care providers to top scientists, Governors and Mayors, the Joint Mission 
was 
struck by the sincerity
 
and 
dedication that each brings 
to this COVID
-
19 response.
 
 
 
3.
 

this 
new respiratory pathogen 
has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic.
  
A particularly 
compelling statistic is that on the first day of the advance
 

2478 new
ly
 
confirmed 
cases of COVID
-
19 reported in China.  Two weeks later, on the 
final day of this Mission, China reported 
409 newly confirmed
 
cases.  This decline in 
COVID
-
19 cases across China is real.
 
 
Several sources of data s
upport this conclusion, including the steep decline in fever clinic 
visits, the opening up of treatment beds as cured patients are discharged, and the 
challenges to recruiting new patients for clinical trials.  Based on a comparison of crude 
attack rates a
cross provinces, t
he Joint Mission estimates that 
this truly 
all
-
of
-
Government and all
-
of
-
society approach 
that has been taken in China 
has averted or at 
least delayed hundreds of thousands of COVID
-
19 cases in 
the country
.  By extension, 
the reduction tha
t has been achieved in the force of COVID
-
19 infection in China 
has 
also 
played a 
significant 
role in protecting the global community
 
and creating a stronger 
first
 
line of defense against international spread
.  
Containing this outbreak, however, 
has come a
t great cost 
and sacrifice by 
China and its people
, in both human and material
 
terms.
 
 
While the
 

-
19 operation has been remarkable
, it has 
also highlighted 
areas for improvement in public health emergency response capacity.
 
 
  
18
 
These include overcoming any obstacles to act
 
immediately on early alerts, to massively 
scale
-
up capacity for isolation and care, 
to optimize the protection of frontline health 
care workers in all settings, 
to enhance collaborati
ve
 
action on 
priority 
gaps in 
knowledge and tools, and to more clearly communicate key data and developments 
internationally.
 
 
 
4.
 
China is already
,
 
and rightfully
,
 
working to 
bolster 
its economy, 
reopen 
its schools and 
return to a more normal semblance of its 
society
, even as it 
works to contain the 
remaining chains of COVID
-
19 transmission.
 
 
Appropriately, a science
-
based, risk
-
informed and 
phased approach 
is being taken, with a clear recognition and readiness 
of the need to immediately react to any new COVID
-
19 cases or clusters
 
as key 
elements of the containment strategy are lifted.  
 
 
Despite the declining case numbers, across China every province, city and community 
visited is urgently escalating their 
investments in acute care beds
 
and public health 
capacity.
 
 
It is crucial t
hat this continues.  
Fifty thousand infected COVID
-
19 patient are 
still under treatment, across the country.  However, the 
Joint 
Mission has come to 
understand the 
substantial 
knowledge, experience and capacities that China has rapidly 
built during this cr
isis. Consequently, it 

 
in 
most provinces and municipalities it should 
soon be possible to manage 
a
 
resurgence in
 
COVID
-
19 cases
, using even more tailored and 
sustainable approach
es
 
that 
are 
anchored 
in very rapid ca
se detection, instant activation of key containment activities, direct 
oversight by top leadership, and broad community engagement.
 
 
As China works to resume a more normal level of societal and economic activity, it is 
essential that the world recognizes a
nd reacts positively to the rapidly changing, and 
decreasing, risk of COVID
-

full 
connectivity with 
the world, and 
to 
full productivity and economic output
,
 
is vital to China and to the 
world.  The world urgently 
needs 
access 

-
19, as well as the material goods it brings to the global response.  It is even more urgent 
now, with escalating COVID
-
19 outbreaks outside of China, to constantly reassess any 
restrictions on trave
l and/or trade 
to 
China that go beyond the recommendations of the 
IHR Emergency Committee on COVID
-
19.
 
 
 
The Global Response & Next Steps
 
 
1.
 
The 
COVID
-
19 virus
 
is a new
 
pathogen 
that is highly contagious, can spread quickly, 
and
 
must be considered capable of causing enormous health, economic and societal 
impacts in any setting.  
It is not SARS
 
and it is not influenza. 
 
Building scenarios and 
strategies only on the basis of well
-
known pathogens
 
risks failing to exploit all possibl
e 
measures to slow transmission
 
of the COVID
-
19 virus
, reduce disease and save lives.
 
 
COVID
-
19 is not SARS and it is not influenza.  It is a new virus with its own 
characteristics.  For example, COVID
-
19 transmission in children appears to be limited 
comp
ared with 
in
flu
enza
, while the clinical picture differs from SARS.  Such differences, 
while based on limited data, may be playing a role in the apparent efficacy of rigorously 
  
19
 
applied non
-
pharmaceutical, public health measures to interrupt chains of human
-
to
-
human transmission in a range of settings in China.  The COVID
-
19 virus is unique among 
human coronaviruses in its combination of high transmissibility, 
substantial 
fatal 
outcomes in some high
-
risk groups, and ability to cause huge societal and economic
 
disruption.  For planning purposes, it must be assumed that the global population is 
susceptible to this virus.
 
 
A
s the animal origin of the COVID
-
19 virus is unknown at 
present, the risk of reintroduction into previously infected areas must be 
constantly
 
consider
ed
.  
 
 
The novel nature
,
 
and 
our 
continuously 
evolving understanding
,
 
of this coronavirus 
demands a tremendous agility in our capacity to rapidly adapt and change our readiness 
and response planning as has been done continually in China.  This is 
an extraordinary 
feat for a country of 1.4 billion people.
 
 
 
2.
 

-
pharmaceutical measures to contain 
transmission 
of the COVID
-
19 virus 
in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the 
global response.
  
This rather unique and unprecedented 
public health response in 
China 
reversed the escalating cases in both 
Hubei
, where there has been widespread 
community transmission,
 
and in the importation provinces
, where family clusters 
appear to have driven the outb
reak.  
 
 
Although the timing of the outbreak
 
in China
 
has been relatively similar across the 
countr
y
, transmission chains were established in a wide diversity of settings, from mega
-
cities in the north and south of the country, to remote communities.  Howe
ver, the rapid 

adapted and successfully operationalized in 
a wide range of 
settings.
 
 

-
1
9 readiness and rapid response plans in a thorough assessment of local risks and of 
utilizing a differentiated risk
-
based containment strategy to manage the outbreak in 
areas with no cases vs. sporadic cases vs. clusters of cases vs. community
-
level 
transm
ission.  Such a strategy is essential for ensuring a sustainable approach while 
minimizing the socio
-
economic impact.
 
 
 
3.
 
Much 
of 
the 
global community is 
not yet 
ready, in mindset and materially, to 
implement the measures that have been employed to contain 
COVID
-
19 in China.  
These are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimize 
transmission chains in humans.  Fundamental to these measures is extremely 
proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases, very rapid diagnosis and 
immed
iate case isolation, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts, and an 
exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these 
measures.
 
 
Achieving the 
high 
quality of implementation needed to be successful
 
with such 
measures
 
requires an unusual 
and unprecedented 
speed of decision
-
making by top 
leaders, operational thoroughness by public health systems, and engagement of society.  
  
20
 
Given 
the damage that can be caused by 
uncontrolled, 
community
-
level transmission
 
of 
this virus, 
such an approach 
is warranted 
to 
save lives and to 
gain the weeks and months 
needed for 
the testing of therapeutics
 
and 
vaccine development.
  
Furthermore, as the 
majority of new cases outside of China are currently occurring in high and middle
-
income count
ries, a rigorous commitment to slowing transmission in such settings with 
non
-
pharmaceutical measures is vital to achieving a 
second 
line of defense to protect 
low income countries that have weaker health systems and coping capacities.
 
 
The time 
that can be 
gained 
through the full application of these measures 

 
even if just 
days or weeks 

 
can be invaluable in ultimately reducing 
COVID
-
19 illness 
and 
deaths.  
This is apparent 
in 
the huge increase in knowledge, approaches and even tools that has 
t
aken place in 
just 
the 7
 
weeks
 
since this virus was discovered through the rapid 
scientific work that has been done in China.  
 
 
 
4.
 
The time gained 
by rigorously applying COVID
-
19 
containment measures 
must 
be used 
more effectively 
to 
urgently 
enhance global 
readiness and rapidly develop the specific 
tools that are needed to ultimately stop this virus.
 
 
COVID
-
19 is spreading with astonishing speed; COVID
-
19 outbreaks in any setting have 
very serious consequences; and there is now strong evidence that non
-
pharm
aceutical 
interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission.  Concerningly, global and 
national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions.  However, 
to reduce COVID
-
19 illness and death, near
-
term readiness planning must emb
race the 
large
-
scale implementation of high
-
quality, non
-
pharmaceuti
c
al public health measures.  
These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous 
close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/c
ommunity 
engagement.
 
 
A huge array of 
COVID
-
19
 
studies, scientific research projects and product R&D efforts 
are ongoing in China and globally.  This is essential and to be encouraged and supported.  
However, such a large number of projects and products ne
ed
s
 
to be prioritized.  Without 
prioritiz
ing
, 
this 
risks compromising the concentration of attention and resources and 
collaboration required to cut timelines by precious weeks and months.  While progress 
has been made, the urgency of the COVID
-
19 situatio
n supports an even more ruthless 
prioritization of research in the areas of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.
 
 
Similarly, there is a long list of proposed studies on the origins of COVID
-
19, the natural 

responding to cases and saving lives 
makes it difficult for 
policy makers 
to
 
consider and 
act on such comprehensive lists.  
This 
can be addressed by balancing studies with the 
immediate public health and clinical needs of the response.  Studies can be prioritized in 
terms of the largest knowledge gaps that can be most rapidly addr
essed to have 
greatest immediate impact on response operations and patient management.  This 
suggests prioritizing studies to identify risk factors 
for 
transmission in households, 
institutions and the community; convenience sampling for this virus in the p
opulation 
using existing surveillance systems; age
-
stratified sero
-
epidemiologic surveys; the 
analysis of clinical case series; and cluster investigations.
 
  
21
 
 
IV.
 
Major Recommendations
 
 
For China
 
1.
 
Maintain an appropriate level of emergency management protocols, d
epending 
on the assessed risk in each area and recognizing the real risk of new cases and 
clusters of COVID
-
19 as economic activity resumes, movement restrictions are 
lifted, and schools reopen;
 
2.
 
Carefully monitor the phased lifting of the current 
restrictions on movement and 
public gatherings, beginning with the return of workers and migrant labor, 
followed by the eventual reopening of schools and lifting other measures;
 
3.
 
Further strengthen the readiness of emergency management mechanisms, public 
he
alth institutions (e.g. CDCs), medical facilities, and community engagement 
mechanisms to ensure sustained capacity to immediately launch containment 
activities in response to any resurgence in cases;
 
4.
 
Prioritize research that rapidly informs response and r
isk management decisions, 
particularly household and health care facility studies, age
-
stratified sero
-
epidemiologic surveys and rigorous investigation of the animal
-
human interface; 
establish a centralized research program to fast
-
track the most promising
 
rapid 
diagnostics and serologic assays, the testing of potential antivirals and vaccine 
candidates, 
and Chinese engagement in selected multi
-
country trials; and
 
5.
 
As the country with the greatest knowledge on COVID
-
19, further enhance the 
systematic and rea
l
-
time sharing of epidemiologic data, clinical results and 
experience to inform the global response. 
 
 
For countries with imported cases and/or outbreaks of COVID
-
19
 
1.
 
Immediately activate the highest level of national 
Response Management 
protocols to ensure
 
the all
-
of
-
government and all
-
of
-
society approach needed to 
contain COVID
-
19 with non
-
pharmaceutical public health measures;
 
2.
 
Prioritize active, exhaustive case finding and immediate testing
 
and isolation
, 
painstaking contact tracing and rigorous quarantin
e of close contacts;
 
 
3.
 
Fully educate the general public on the seriousness of COVID
-
19 and their role in 
preventing its spread; 
 
4.
 
Immediately expand 
surveillance 
to detect COVID
-
19 transmission chains, by 
testing all patients with atypical pneumonias, conduc
ting screening in some 
patients with upper respiratory illnesses and/or recent COVID
-
19 exposure, and 
adding testing for the COVID
-
19 virus to existing surveillance systems (e.g. 
systems for influenza
-
like
-
illness and SARI);
 
and 
 
  
22
 
5.
 
Conduct multi
-
sector scena
rio planning and simulations for the deployment of 
even more stringent measures to 
interrupt
 
transmission chains as needed (e.g. 
the suspension of large
-
scale gatherings and the closure of schools and 
workplaces)
.
 
 
For u
ninfected countries
 
1.
 
Prepare to immed
iately activate the highest level of emergency response 
mechanisms to trigger the all
-
of
-
government and all
-
of society approach that is 
essential for early containment of a COVID
-
19 outbreak;
 
2.
 
Rapidly test national preparedness plans in light of new knowled
ge on the 
effectiveness of non
-
pharmaceutical measures against COVID
-
19; incorporate 
rapid detection, largescale case isolation and respiratory support capacities, and 
rigorous contact tracing and management in national COVID
-
19 readiness and 
response plan
s and capacities;
 
3.
 
Immediately enhance surveillance for 
COVID
-
19 
as rapid detection is crucial to 
containing spread; 
consider testing all patients with atypical pneumonia for 
the 
COVID
-
19 virus
,
 
and adding testing 
for the virus 
to existing 
in
flu
enza 
surveillance 
systems;
 
4.
 
Begin now to enforce rigorous application of i
nfection prevention and control 
measures in all healthcare facilities, especially in emergency d
epartments and 
outpatient clinics, as this is where COVID
-
19 will enter the health system;
 
a
nd
 
5.
 
Rapidly assess 
the 
general 
population

-
19, adjust 
national health promotion materials and activities accordingly, and engage 
clinical champions to communicate with the media.
 
 
 
For the public
 
1.
 
Recognize that COVID
-
19 
is a 
new and 
concerning 
disease
,
 
but 
that outbreaks 
can 
manage
d with the right response and that the vast majority of 
infected 
people will recover;
 
2.
 
Begin now to adopt and rigorously practice the most important preventive 
measures for COVID
-
19 by frequent hand washing 
and always covering your 
mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing;
 
3.
 
Continually update yourself on COVID
-
19
 
and its signs and symptoms (i.e. fever 
and dry cough)
, because the strategies and response activities will constantly 
improve as new information on t
his disease is 
accumulating 
every day; and
 
4.
 
Be prepared to actively support a response to COVID
-
19 in a variety of ways, 

the high
-
risk elderly population.
 
 
  
23
 
For the 
international community
 
1.
 
Recognize that true solidarity and collaboration is essential between nations to 
tackle the common threat that COVID
-
19 represents
 
and operationalize this 
principle
;
 
2.
 
Rapidly share information as required under the International Heal
th Regulations 
(IHR) including detailed information about imported cases to facilitate contact 
tracing and inform containment measure
s
 
that span countries;
 
3.
 
Recogniz
e
 
the rapidly changing risk profile of COVID
-
19 affected countries 
and 
continually monitor o
utbreak trends and control capacities to reassess
 
any 

additional health measures

 
that significantly interfere with international 
travel 
and trade
.

The response structures

were rapidly put in place according to existing emergency 
plans and aligned from the top to the bottom. 
 
This was replicated at the four levels of 
government
 
(national provincial, prefecture and county/district
)
. 
 
 
Organizational structure and response mechanism
 
 
Response activation at the national level:
 
COVID
-
19 prevention and control mechanisms 
were initiated immediately after the outbreak was dec
lared and nine working groups were 
set up to coordinate the response: 
a)
 
Coordination 
b) 
Epidemic prevention and control 
c)
 
Medical treatment 
d)
 
Research 
e)
 
Public communication 
f)
 
Foreign affairs 
g)
 
Medical 
material support 
h)
 
Life maintenance supplies an
d 
i)
 
Social stability. Each 
working 
group has 
a ministerial level leader. Emergency response laws and regulations for the emergency 
response to public health emergencies, prevention and control of infectious diseases have 
been developed or updated to guide
 
the response.
 
 
 
Response activation in provinces
: Each province set up a similar structure to manage the 
outbreak. The response is organi
z
ed at the levels of national, provincial, prefecture, 
county/district and the community. By 
29 
January, all provinces across 
China
 
had launched 
the highest level of response for major public health emergencies. 
 
 
Response
 
Strategy
 
 
A clear strategy was developed, 
and 
goals were well 
articulated
 
and communicated across 
the entire response architectur
e. This strategy was rapidly adapted and adjusted 
to
 
the 
outbreak
,
 
both in terms of the epidemiological situation over time and in different parts of 
the country.
 
 
The epidemiological situation 
has been 
used to 
define location into four areas
:
 

 
In areas wit
hout 
cases
,
 
the strategy in these areas 
is
 
to "strictly prevent 
introduction". This includes quarantine arrangements in transportation hubs, 
monitoring for temperature changes, strengthening of triage arrangements, use of 
fever clinics, and ensuring normal
 
economic and social operations. 
 

 
In areas with sporadic cases,
 
the strategy 
is focused on
 
"reducing importation, 
stopping transmission and providing appropriate treatment"
.
 

 
In areas with community clusters,
 
the strategy 
i
s
 
focussed on
 
"stopping transmissi
on, 
preventing exportation, and strengthening treatment". 
 

 
In areas with community transmission,
 
the strictest prevention and control 
strategies are being implemented, the entry and exit of people from the
se
 
areas has 
been stopped and public health and med
ical treatment measures are 
comprehensively strengthened.

Main control measures
 
implemented in China
 
 
The main control measures implemented in China are as follows and are illustrated in 
Figures

, representing 
the 
national level response and 
examples of the 
response at the 
Provincial 
and municipal 
levels
:
 
 
Monitoring and reporting:
 
COVID
-
19 was included in the statutory reporting of infectious 
diseases on
 
20
 
January and plans were formulated to strengthen diagnosis, monitoring, and 
reporting. 
 
 
Strengthening port
s
 
of entry and quarantine
:
 
The Customs Department launched the 
emergency plan for public health emergencies at ports across the country and restarted the 
health declaration card system for entry and exit into cities as well as strict mo
nitoring of 
the temperature of entry and exit passengers. 
 
 
Treatment:
 
For severe or critical patients, the
 
principle of "
F
our 
C
oncentrations" was 
implemented: i.e. concentrating patients, 
medical 
experts, resources and treatment into 
special centres. 
 
All
 
cities and districts transformed relevant hospitals, increased the number 
of designated hospitals, dispatched medical staff, and set up expert groups for consultation, 
so as to minimise mortality of severe patients. 
 
Medical resources from all over 
China
 
have 
been mobili
z
ed to support the medical treatment of patients in Wuhan.
 
 
Epidemiological investigation and close contact management:
 
Strong epidemiological 
investigations are being carried out for cases, clusters, and contacts 
to 
identify the source of 
infection and implement targeted control measures
, such as
 
contact tracing. 
 
 
Social distancing
: At the national level
,
 
the State Council extended the Spring Festival 
holiday in 2020, all parts of the country actively cancelled or suspended activities like
 
sport 
events, cinema, theatre
,
 
and
 
schools and colleges in all parts of the country postponed 
re
-
opening
 
after the holiday
. 
 
Enterprises and institutions have staggered their return to work. 
Transportation Departments set
up
 
thousands of health and quarant
ine stations in national 
service areas, and 
in 
entrances and exits for passengers at stations. 
 
Hubei Province adopted 
the most stringent traffic control measures, such as suspension of urban public transport, 
including 
subway, ferry and long
-
distance passenger transport. 
 
Every citizen has to wear a 
mask in public. 
 
Home 
support mechanisms were 
established. 
 
As a 
consequence of all 
of 
these measure
s
,
 
public life is very reduced.
 
 
Funding and material support:
 
Payment of 
health insurance was taken over by the state, as 
well as 
the work to 
improv
e
 
accessibility and affordability of medical materials, provid
e
 
personal protection materials, and 
ensure 
basic living materials for affected people. 
 
 
Emergency material support
:
 
T
he government restored production and expanded 
production capacity, organized key enterprises that have already started to exceed current 
production capacity, support
ed
 
local enterprises to expand imports, 
and 
use
d
 
cross
-
border 
e
-
commerce platforms and ent
erprises to help import medical materials
 
and improve the 
ability to guarantee supplies.

was 
invited to visit Wuhan. 
 
A

is 
fully participating in the management 
of self

isolation and help isolated residents at home to solve practi
cal 
life

Measures were taken to limit 
the 
movement of the population through home

. 
 
Up to now, 
outside of
 
Hubei, 30 provinces have registered and managed 
more than 5 million people coming from Wuhan

The main 
signs and symptoms
 
of COVID
-
19 
include feve
r
, 
dry 
cough, fatigue, sputum 
production, shortness of breath, myalgia or arthralgia, sore throat, 
and 
headach
e.  N
ausea 
or vomiting 
has been reported in a small pe
rcentage of patients 
(5%)
.
 
 
On 
14 
Feb
ruary
, 
China CDC described the clinical features, outcomes, laboratory and radiologic findings of 44 
672 
laboratory
-
confirmed cases. 
 
Only 965 (2.2%) were under 20 years 
of age 
and there is 
just one recorded death 
(0.1%)
 
in this age group
. 
 
Most
 
patients
 
(77.8%) were aged 30 to 69 
years. 
 
Patients 
aged 
over 
80 years had a CFR of 14.8%. 
 
The CFR was highest in those with 
  
32
 
comorbidities including cardiovascular, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension 
and c
ancer. 
 
 
As opposed to 
Influenza A(
H1N1
)pdm09
,
 
pregnant women
 
do not appear to be at higher 
risk of severe disease. In an investigation of 147 pregnant women (64 confirmed, 82 
suspected and 1 asymptomatic)
,
 
8% had severe disease and 1% were critical. 
 
 
Sev
ere cases
 
are defined as tachypnoea 
(

30 breaths/ min)
 
or o
xygen saturation
 

93% at 
rest
, or PaO2/FIO2 <300 mmH
g
. 
 
C
ritical cases
 
are defined as 
respiratory failure requiring 
mechanical ventilation, shock or other organ failure that requires 
intensive 
care
. 
 
About a 
quarter of 
severe and critical cases 
require 
mechanical 
ventilation while 
the remaining 
75% 
require
 
only 
oxygen supplementation. 
 
 
China has a principle of
 
early identification
, early isolation, early diagnosis and early 
treatment. 
 
Early identi
fication of suspect cases is critical to containment efforts and occurs 
via a process of temp
erature
 
screening and questioning at entrances to many institutions, 
communit
ies
, travel venues (airports, train stations) and hospitals. 
 
Many hospitals have 
feve
r clinics 
that were 
established and maintained since the SARS 
outbreak
.
 
 
In China, 
laboratory tests were originally requested according to the case definitions
,
 
which included 
an epidemiological link to Hubei or other 
confirmed 
cases.
 
 
However, more recently
,
 
a 
more 
liberal clinical testing regimen
 
allow
s
 
clinicians to test with a low index of suspicion. 
 
 
Suspect cases
 
are isolated in normal pressure single rooms, wear a surgical mask
 
(for source 
control). 
 
Staff 
in China 
wear a cap, 
eye protection, n95 masks, gown and gloves (single use 
only).
 
 
In Wuhan it is necessary for most suspects to be cohorted in a normal pressure 
isolation ward. 
 
Staff wear PPE
 
continuously
, changing it only when they leave the ward.
 
 
PCR 
test results
 
are 
ret
urn
ed
 
the same day.
 
 
If positive, patients are transported to 
designated hospitals (including negative pressure ambulances in some cities). 
 
All patients
,
 
including the mild and asymptomatic, 
with a positive test are admitted. 
 
The designated 
hospitals are
 
known and are strategically placed 
with 
at least one per district
/county
. 
 
Positive cases are cohorted by gender. 
 
Negative tested patients are managed based on 
clinical needs. 
 
All patients 
are evaluated with 
a respiratory multiplex 
to look for other 
dia
gnoses. 
 
This
 
can add to the reassurance 
that
 
a negative COVID
-
19 test
 
reflects a lack of 
infection with COVID
-
19
. 
 
 
 
In Wuhan, 
there are 45 
designated 
hospitals
, 6 of which are designated for critical patients, 
and 39 for severe patients and
/or
 
any patients >65 years old. 
 
There are an additional 10 
temporary 
hospitals
 
reconstructed from gymnasium and exhibition centers, which
 
are for 
mild patients. 
 
Other surge measures undertaken in Wuhan include 
two
 
new temporary 
hospitals with 2600 beds, plu
s many makeshift hospitals to increase bed capacity.
 
 
Bed 
capacity within Wuhan has increased to >50,000.
 
 
Patients are treated according to the 
National Clinical guideline
s
 
(edition 6) released by 
the 
China National Health Commission (
NHC
)
. 
 
There 
are 
no 
specific antiviral or immune 
modulating agents proven (or
 
recommended)
 
to improve outcomes
. 
 
All patients are 
monitored by regular pulse oximetry. 
 
The guidelines include supportive care by clinical 
category (mild, moderate, severe and critical)
,
 
as well a
s 
the role of 
investigational 
  
33
 
treatments such as
 
chloroquine, 
phosphate
, 
lopinavir/ritonavir, alpha interferon, 
ribavirin, 
arbidol. 
 
The application of 
intubation/
invasive ventilation and ECMO in critically ill patients 
can improve survival. 
 
Th
e Joint Mis
sion Team was
 
told 
of ECMO use 
in four patients at one 
hospital with 
one death and three who appeared to be improving. 
 
Clearly
,
 
though ECMO is 
very resource consumptive
, 
any health system would need to carefully weigh the benefits. 
 
The
re is widespread 
use of Traditional Chinese Medicine
s
 
(TCM)
, for which the affects must 
be fully 
evaluated
.
 
 
Patients with COVID
-
19 are not permitted 
visitors
. 
 
Staff use coveralls, mask
s
, eye cover, 
and 
gloves
,
 
removing 
PPE 
only when they leave the ward.
 
 
Patients are
 
dis
charged
 
after clinical recovery (afebrile
 
>3 days
,
 
resolution of symptoms
 
and 
radiologic improvement
) and 2 negative PCR tests taken 24 hours apart. 
 
Upon discharge, 
t
hey are asked to minimise family and social contact
 
and to
 
wear a mask
.  
There are 
expect
ations of clinical trial results 
within a matter of weeks, 
which will see further 
opportunities for treatment.
 
 
There are guidelines for 
elderly care
 
specifically targeting prevention 
in 
individuals and 
introduction of COVID
-
19 to nursing homes. 
 
 
Training
 
programmes by video conference nationally are scaled up to inform staff of best 
practice and to ensure PPE usage. 
 
Clinical champions
 
are created to disperse knowledge 
and provide local expertise. 
 
 
Maintenance of usual healthcare activities is maintained
 
by hospital zoning

.
 
 
It is notable that within weeks following 
the 
identification of the 
virus, 
a series of 
reliable 
and sensitive 
diagnostic tools
 
were
 
developed
 
and deployed.
 
 
On 1

s and probes was 
shared 
with 
WHO and the international community 
by C

January 2020
.
 
 
To facilitate 
product development and research on the new virus, COVID
-
19 virus sequences w
ere
 
uploaded to the GISAID Database
 
by China
.  
 
 
By 
23 Febr
uar
y, there 
we
re 10 kits for detection of COVID

19 approved in China by the 
NMPA, including
 
6
 
RT

1 isothermal amplification kit, 
1 virus sequencing product 
and 
2
 
colloidal gold antibody detection 
kit
s
.  Several other tests are entered in the 
emergency a
ppr
oval procedure.
 
 
Currently
,
 
there are at least 
6
 
local producers of PCR test 
kits
 
approved by NMPA
.  
Overall, producers 
have the capacity
 
to produce and distribute as 
m
any
 
as 1,650,000 test
s
/week.

Specimens 
from both the upper respiratory tract (URT; nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) 
and lower respiratory tract (LRT; expectorated spu
tum, endotracheal aspirate, or 
bronchoalveolar lavage) are collected for COVID
-
19 testing by PCR.
 
 
 
COVID
-
19 
v
ir
us has been detected in
 
respiratory, fecal and blood 
specimens
. 
 
According to 
preliminary data
 
from 
Guangzhou CDC 
as of 20 February
, 
virus 
can 
initially 
be detected in 
upper respiratory 
samples 
1
-
2 
days 
prior to 
symptom
 
onset
 
and 
persist for 7
-
12
 
days in 
moderate cases
 
and 
up to 2 weeks
 
in severe cases
. 
 
Vira
l R
NA has been detected in f
e
ces in 
up to
 
30% of patients from day 5 
following onset of s
ymptoms
 
and has been noted 
for up to 
4
-
5 weeks in moderate cases.
  
However, i
t is not clear whether this correlates with the 
presence of infectious virus.
 
 
While 
live 
virus has been cultured from stool in some 
cases, 
the role of fecal
-
oral transmission is 
not yet well understood
.
 
 
COVID
-
19
 
has been isolated 
from the clinical specimens 
using
 
human airway epithelial cells
, 
Vero E6 and Huh
-
7 cell lines. 
 
 
Serological diagnostics
 
are rapidly being developed 
but 
are
 
not yet widely used.
 
 
Joint 
Mission members met with local research teams 
at the
 
C
hina 
CDC, 
Guangzhou Regenerative 
Medicine and Health 
Guangdong 
Laboratory
.  The
 
teams
 
reported on 
the 
development of 
tests for 
IgM, IgG and IgM+IgG 
using 
rapid test 
platforms utilizing
 
chemiluminiscence
. 
 
ELISA

Research & Development
 
 
The 
government 
of China 
has initiated a series of major emergency research programs on 
virus genomics, antivirals, traditional Chinese medicines, clinical trials, vaccines, diagnostics 
an
d animal models.  Research includes fundamental basic research and human subjects 
research.  For 
the 
purpose of this report, human studies are limited to those involving IRB 
approval and informed consent.  Other forms of human subjects investigation
s
 
are i
ncluded 
in the sections on epidemiology
 
in this report
.  Well
-
focused, robust research conduct
ed
 
in 
the setting of an outbreak has the potential of saving many lives by identifying the most 
effective ways to prevent, diagnose and treat disease.
 
 
Since the 
COVID
-
19 virus
 
has a genome identity of 96% to a bat SARS
-
like coronavirus and 
86
%
-
92
% to a 
pangolin SARS
-
like coronavirus, an animal source for COVID
-
19 is highly likely.  
This was corroborated 
by 
the high number of RT
-
PCR positive environmental samples 
taken 
from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.  
 
 
At least 
8
 
nucleic acid
-
based 
methods
 
for 
direct 
detection of COVID
-
19 
and two colloidal 
gold antibody detection 
kits 
have been approved in China by the NMPA
. 
 
Several 
other tests 
are 
close to
 
approval.  
It
 
will be important to compare the sensitivities and specificities of 
these and future serologic tests. 
 
Development of rapid and accurate 
point
-
of
-
care tests
 
which perform well in field settings are especially useful if the test can be incorporated into 
pr
esently commercially available multiplex respiratory virus panels.  This would markedly 
improve early detection and isolation of infected patients and, by extension, identification 
of contacts.  
Rapid IgM and IgG antibody testing
 
are also important ways to
 
facilitate early 
diagnosis.  Standard serologic testing can be used for retrospective diagnoses in the context 
of serosurveys that help better understand the full spectrum of COVID
-
19 infection.  
 
 
  
35
 
A variety of 
repurposed drugs and investigational drugs
 
h
ave been identified.  Screening 
NMPA approved drug libraries and other chemical libraries have identified novel agents.  
Hundreds of clinical trials involving remdesivir, chloroquine, favipiravir, chloroquine, 
convalescent plasma, TCM and other interventio
ns are planned or underway.
 
 
Rapid 
completion of the most important of these studies is critical to identifying truly effective 
therapies.  
However,
 
e
valuation of investigational agents requires adequately powered, 
randomized, controlled trials with realis
tic eligibility criteria and appropriate stratification of 
patients
.  It is important for there to be a degree of coordination between those conducting 
studies within
 
and beyond 
China.
 
 
The development of a safe and effective 
vaccine
 
for this highly commun
icable respiratory 
virus is an important epidemic control measure.  Recombinant protein, mRNA, DNA, 
inactivated whole virus and recombinant adenovirus vaccines are being developed and 
some are now entering animal studies. 
 
Vaccine safety is of prime concer
n in the area of 
coronavirus infection in view of the past experience of disease enhancement by inactivated 
whole virus measles vaccine and similar reports in animal experiments with SARS 
coronavirus vaccines.  It will be important that these vaccine candi
dates rapidly move into 
appropriate clinical trials.
 
 
The ideal 
animal model
 
for studying routes of virus transmission, pathogenesis, antiviral 
therapy, vaccine and immune responses has yet to be found.  The ACE2 transgenic mouse 
model and 
Macaca Rhesus 
mo
del are already used in research laboratories.  
Systematically 
address
ing
 
which models can accurately mimic human infection is required.
 
 
There is a global rush for masks, hand hygiene products and other personal protective 
equipment.  The relative importance of 
non
-
pharmaceutical control measures
 
including 
masks, hand hygiene, and social distancing require further research
 
to quantify their
 
impact
.   
 
 
There are distinct patterns of intra
-
familial transmission of COVID
-
19.  It is unclear whether 
or not there are host factors, including genetic factors, that influence susceptibility or 
disease course.  COVID
-
19 has a varied clinical course an
d a precise description of that 
course is not available.  In addition
,
 
the long
-
term consequences of COVID
-
19 are unknown.  
An observational cohort study of patients with COVID
-
19 enrolled from the time of 
diagnosis (
with 
appropriate controls) could provid
e in
-
depth information about clinical, 
virologic and immunologic characteristics of COVID
-
19

research areas with immediate to longer term goals.

Physicians and all health care workers need to maintai
n a high level of clinical alert 
for COVID
-

For affected countries, 
standardize 
training 
for clinical care 
and 
IPC
 
and scale with 
the development of local (e.g. district level) experts
 

 
Ensure concurrent testing for other viral pathogens to support a 
negative COVID

test
 

 
Ensure maintenance of usual and essential services during the outbreak
 
 
  
39
 

 
Ensure processes are in place 
for infection prevention among
 
the most vulnerable

Additional effort should be made 
to f
ind the animal source
,
 
including the natural 
reservoir and any intermediate amplification host
,
 
to prevent any new epidemic foci 
or resurgence of similar epidemics

Efforts should be made to consistently evaluate existing and future 
diagnostic 
tests 
for
 
detection of COVID

19
 
using
 
a harmonized set of standards for laboratory tests 
and a biorepository that can be used for evaluating these tests  
 

 
Consider the establishment of a centralized research program in China to oversee 
th
at
 
por
t
folio
 
and 
ensure
 
the
 
most promising research (vaccines, treatments, 
pathogenesis) 
are 
adequately supported and studied first
;
 
p
rogram staff dedicated 
to the
 
clinical
 
research would work at the 
clinical 
research site(s)
 
to decrease the 
research workload of the clinicians at th
e site
 

 
Consider 
including one or more sites within China in the ongoing and future multi
-
cente
r
, international trials
;
 
Chinese investigators 
should
 
be actively engaged in
 
international trials
 

 
Continue to develop a
dditional animal
 
models
, making
 
e
very effort to 
e
nsure these 
mimic human infection and virus transmission as closely as possible
 

 
Conduct studies to
 
determine which of the commonly used forms of PPE are most 
effective in controlling the spread of COVID
