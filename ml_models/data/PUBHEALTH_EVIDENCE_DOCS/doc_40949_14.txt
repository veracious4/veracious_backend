 Objectives To describe the coagulation feature of patients with NCP.
 Methods Conventional coagulation results and outcomes of 183 consecutive patients with confirmed NCP in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed.
 Results The overall mortality was 11.5%, the non‐survivors revealed significantly higher D‐dimer and fibrin degradation product (FDP) levels, longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time compared to survivors on admission (P  3.0 (3 points) 18 (85.7)   Fibrinogen (g/L)    6 (2 points) 10 (47.6)   Meeting the ISTH criteria of DIC (Total points ≥5) 15 (71.4)      Note         D‐dimer cutoff levels were defined according to a previous report derived from more than 1000 samples in intensive care.7         Abbreviations: DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; ISTH, International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis; NCP, novel coronavirus pneumonia                  In our enrolled patients with NCP, the non‐survivors revealed significantly higher D‐dimer and FDP levels, and longer PT compared to survivors on admission.
 By the late hospitalization, the fibrinogen and AT levels were also significantly lower in non‐survivors; this suggested that conventional coagulation parameters during the course of NCP were significantly associated with prognosis.
 DIC appeared in most of the deaths.
 Patients presenting with a virus infection may develop into sepsis associated with organ dysfunction.
 Sepsis is well established as one of the most common causes of DIC; development of DIC results when monocytes and endothelial cells are activated to the point of cytokine release following injury, with expression of tissue factor and secretion of von Willebrand factor.
 Circulation of free thrombin, uncontrolled by natural anticoagulants, can activate platelets and stimulate fibrinolysis.8 At the late stages of NCP, levels of fibrin‐related markers (D‐dimer and FDP) moderately or markedly elevated in all deaths, which suggested a common coagulation activation and secondary hyperfibrinolysis condition in these patients.
 In a previous study,9 Gralinski et al investigated viral pathogenesis and identified a novel host pathway involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐coronavirus disease progression.
 Their data suggest that dysregulation of the urokinase pathway during SARS‐coronavirus infection contributes to more severe lung pathology and that plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1 plays a protective role following infection.
 In addition, Fatma Berri et al10 reported that plasminogen contributes to inflammation caused by influenza through fibrinolysis, and 6‐aminocaproic acid can protect against influenza.
 Presumably, fibrinolysis may also be induced following severe 2019‐nCoV infection.
 The limitations of this report included that, as a relatively small, single‐center study, the mortality and characteristics of enrolled patients may not be representative; our findings should be confirmed in an adequately powered clinical study.
 In addition, some patients are still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission.
 Nonetheless, the present study has shown that existence of DIC is common in deaths with NCP; abnormal coagulation results, especially markedly elevated D‐dimer and FDP, may have the potential to guide therapy and evaluate prognosis.
