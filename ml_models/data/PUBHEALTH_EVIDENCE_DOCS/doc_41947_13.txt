(d) NORMALIZATIONREQUIREMENTS.Š (1) INGENERAL
.ŠA normalization method of accounting shall not be treated as being used with respect to any public 
utility property for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 if the taxpayer, in computing its cost 
of service for ratemaking purposes and reflecting operating 
results in its regulated books of account, reduces the excess 
tax reserve more rapidly or to a greater extent than such 
reserve would be reduced under the average rate assumption 
method. (2) ALTERNATIVEMETHODFORCERTAINTAXPAYERS
.ŠIf, as of the first day of the taxable year that includes the date 
of enactment of this ActŠ (A) the taxpayer was required by a regulatory agency to compute depreciation for public utility property on the 
basis of an average life or composite rate method, and (B) the taxpayer™s books and underlying records did not contain the vintage account data necessary to apply 
the average rate assumption method, the taxpayer will be treated as using a normalization method 
of accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer 
uses the alternative method for public utility property that 
is subject to the regulatory authority of that jurisdiction. (3) DEFINITIONS.ŠFor purposes of this subsectionŠ (A) EXCESSTAXRESERVE
.ŠThe term ‚‚excess tax reserve™™ means the excess ofŠ (i) the reserve for deferred taxes (as described in section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986) as of the day before the corporate rate reduc-
tions provided in the amendments made by this section 
take effect, over (ii) the amount which would be the balance in such reserve if the amount of such reserve were deter-
mined by assuming that the corporate rate reductions 
provided in this Act were in effect for all prior periods. 
(B) AVERAGERATEASSUMPTIONMETHOD
.ŠThe average rate assumption method is the method under which the 
excess in the reserve for deferred taxes is reduced over 
the remaining lives of the property as used in its regulated 
books of account which gave rise to the reserve for deferred 
taxes. Under such method, during the time period in which 
the timing differences for the property reverse, the amount 
of the adjustment to the reserve for the deferred taxes 
is calculated by multiplyingŠ (i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes for the property to the aggregate timing differences for 
the property as of the beginning of the period in ques-
tion, by  H.R.1Š47 
(ii) the amount of the timing differences which reverse during such period. 
(C) ALTERNATIVEMETHOD
.ŠThe ‚‚alternative method™™ is the method in which the taxpayerŠ (i) computes the excess tax reserve on all public utility property included in the plant account on the 
basis of the weighted average life or composite rate 
used to compute depreciation for regulatory purposes, 
and (ii) reduces the excess tax reserve ratably over the remaining regulatory life of the property. (4) TAXINCREASEDFORNORMALIZATIONVIOLATION
.ŠIf, for any taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of 
this Act, the taxpayer does not use a normalization method 
of accounting for the corporate rate reductions provided in 
the amendments made by this sectionŠ (A) the taxpayer™s tax for the taxable year shall be increased by the amount by which it reduces its excess 
tax reserve more rapidly than permitted under a normaliza-
tion method of accounting, and (B) such taxpayer shall not be treated as using a normalization method of accounting for purposes of sub-
sections (f)(2) and (i)(9)(C) of section 168 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 13002. REDUCTION IN DIVIDEND RECEIVED DEDUCTIONS TO REFLECT LOWER CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES. (a) DIVIDENDSRECEIVEDBY
