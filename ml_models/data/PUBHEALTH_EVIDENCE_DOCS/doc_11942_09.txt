NOTES ON DATA QUALITY: 
Provisional counts for 12 months-ending are the number of deaths received and processed for the 12 month period ending in the month indicated. 
Deaths are classified by reporting jurisdiction in which the death occurred. Jurisdictions are selected for inclusion in the report based on two measures of data quality: 1) 








mutually exclusive because deaths may involve more than one drug.  Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percent with at least one drug or drug 

class specified were identified through MCODs in the range T36-T50.8.
