 Instead, the medicine is released further down the gut in your intestine.If you take gastro-resistant tablets, swallow them whole with or after food.
 Do not crush or chew them.If you take effervescent tablets, dissolve 1 to 2 tablets in a glass (150ml) of water and drink.Doses of 3 tablets should be dissolved in 300ml.
 To make sure there's no medicine left, rinse the empty glass with a small amount of water and drink it.
 Take with or after food.What if I forget to take it?Take your forgotten dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose.Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you.You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.What if I take too much?If you take too many naproxen tablets, you're more likely to get some of the common side effects.
 Contact your doctor straight away.

 Common questions about naproxen      How does naproxen work?
 Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
 It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.Paracetamol is usually the best treatment for most types of pain, but naproxen is better for some types, such as period pain or back pain.
 When will I feel better?
 You should start to feel better 1 hour after taking naproxen.But it might take up to 3 days for naproxen to work properly if you take it regularly twice a day.
 How long will I take naproxen for?
 Depending on why you're taking naproxen, you may only need to take it for a short time.For example, if you have a sore back or period pain, you may only need to take naproxen for 1 or 2 days.You may need to take it for longer if you have a long-term condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis.If you need to take naproxen for a long time, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to protect your stomach from side effects.It's best to take the lowest dose of naproxen for the shortest time to control your symptoms.Talk to your doctor if you're unsure how long you need to take naproxen for.
 Can I take naproxen for a long time?
 Naproxen can cause an ulcer in your stomach or gut if you take it for a long time or in big doses.There's also a small risk that people taking very big doses for a long time may get heart failure or kidney failure.It's best to take the lowest dose that works for the shortest possible time.If you need to take naproxen very often or you're taking a big dose, talk to your doctor about your pain.
 Is naproxen addictive?
 No, naproxen is not addictive, but it's important to always take it as prescribed.
 Are there other painkillers I can try?
 The type of painkiller that's best depends on what type of pain you have and the cause of your pain.If naproxen does not get rid of your pain, you can try painkillers that you can buy from shops and pharmacies, such as paracetamol or co-codamol (paracetamol combined with low-dose codeine).If the medicine you buy is not controlling your pain, your doctor may recommend another type of treatment to help your pain, such as exercise or physiotherapy.Your doctor may also be able to prescribe a stronger painkiller, such as higher dose co-codamol or codeine.Naproxen does not work for some types of pain, such as nerve pain.Your doctor will have to prescribe a different medicine if your pain is related to your nerves.
 Why do I need to be careful of stomach ulcers?
 Naproxen can cause an ulcer in your stomach or gut if you take it for a long time or in big doses, or if you're elderly or in poor general health.Your doctor may tell you not to take naproxen if you have a stomach ulcer or you have had one in the past.If you need to take naproxen but you're at risk of getting a stomach ulcer, your doctor may prescribe another medicine for you to take alongside naproxen to protect your stomach.The most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the stomach.But stomach ulcers are not always painful and some people may have other symptoms, such as indigestion, heartburn and feeling sick.If you're prone to stomach ulcers or have had one before, take paracetamol instead of naproxen as it's gentler on your stomach.
 Important If you think you may have symptoms of a stomach ulcer, stop taking naproxen and contact your doctor.
 Can naproxen cause heart failure?
 It's been said that taking anti-inflammatory medicines increases the chances of getting heart failure.But the risk is very small for most people.If you find you need to take naproxen very often or you're taking doses higher than recommended, talk to your doctor about your pain.Some anti-inflammatory medicines are less risky than others.
 Your doctor will be able to help you decide which is the best one for you.
 Does naproxen cause kidney failure?
 Naproxen is safe for occasional use when taken as advised by a doctor.If you have problems with your kidney function, talk to your doctor about the best anti-inflammatory to take.NSAIDs may cause an increased risk of sudden kidney failure and even progressive kidney damage.
 Does naproxen cause an irregular heartbeat?
 It's thought some anti-inflammatory medicines, including naproxen, can increase the chance of you getting an irregular heartbeat (such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter).But the chances of getting an irregular heartbeat is small and not enough to recommend people stop taking these medicines.If you're prescribed naproxen for a long-term condition, keep taking it and talk to your doctor if you're worried.If you buy naproxen from a shop, occasional doses or short courses (2 or 3 days) are safe.
 Does naproxen cause hearing loss?
 It's been reported that women taking some anti-inflammatory medicines, including naproxen, twice a week for more than a year have a higher chance of losing their hearing.But there's no proof that naproxen and similar anti-inflammatory medicines cause hearing loss.Hearing loss is common as people get older.There are ways to protect your hearing, for example, limiting your exposure to loud noise, wearing hearing protection in noisy places, and keeping the volume down on personal headphones.If you find you have to take naproxen several days a week, talk to your doctor about what's causing your pain and whether there are better ways to manage it.
 Will it affect my fertility?
 Taking anti-inflammatory medicines, like naproxen, in large doses or for a long time can affect ovulation in women.
 This may make it more difficult to get pregnant.Do not take naproxen if you're trying to get pregnant or you're having tests for infertility.Paracetamol is a better painkiller in these situations.There's no firm evidence to suggest that taking naproxen will reduce fertility in men.
 Will it affect my contraception?
 Naproxen does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.
 Can I drink alcohol with it?
 Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking naproxen.
 But drinking too much alcohol may irritate your stomach.
