 &amp; Misleading!Food / Drink / By Rich Buhler &amp; Staff / March 17, 2015 March 17, 2015 Fireball Whiskey Contains Anti-Freeze Ingredient-Truth!
 &amp; Misleading!
 Summary of eRumor:Reports have gone viral that 		Fireball Whiskey has been recalled because it contains an ingredient 		found in anti-freeze.
 The Truth:It’s true that Fireball 		Whiskey was recalled, but claims that it contains an anti-freeze 		ingredient are misleading.
 Sazarac, Inc., bottler and 		distributor of Fireball Whiskey, announced the recall in a statement released on October 28, 2014.
 Batches of the cinnamon-flavored whiskey 		were recalled in Europe, Finland, Sweden and Norway because it contained 		more of the ingredient propylene glycol (PG) than allowed in those 		regions.“Regulations for 		product formulations are different in Europe, which explains why recipes 		for products like soft drinks, alcohol/spirits and even candies and 		confections are slightly different than their North American 		counterparts,” Sazarac said.
 “Fireball, therefore, has a slightly 		different recipe for Europe.
 Unfortunately, Fireball shipped its North 		American formula to Europe and found that one ingredient is out of 		compliance with European regulations.”The company assured 		consumers that Fireball Whiskey was a safe drink, and that PG has been 		used as a flavoring ingredient for more than 50 years.
 However, reports that Fireball Whiskey included an anti-freeze ingredient quickly went 		viral.It’s true that the 		ingredient PG is sometimes used as an anti-freeze agent, the EPA reports.
 But the 		term “anti-freeze” conjures misleading images of the neon-green chemical 		that prevents engines from freezing in cold weather.
 Anti-freeze is also 		used in the food industry.
 PG absorbs water, so it works as an effective 		anti-freeze agent by preventing leaking water from coming into contact 		with food, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.
 “Propylene glycol 		has been approved for use at certain levels in food, cosmetics and 		pharmaceutical products,” the CDC said.
 “If you eat food products, use 		cosmetics or take medications that contain it, you will be exposed to 		propylene glycol, but these amounts are not considered harmful.” The FDA has found that PG can be safely ingested over long periods if it doesn’t account 		for more than 5 percent of a person’s total food intake.
