 But efforts are \"more targeted,\" said Anthony Verdugo, founder and executive director of the Christian Family Coalition.The bill sponsored by Pigman, an emergency medicine physician, would provide protections in the cases where a failed abortion could result in a live birth — either a late-term abortion (which can only be performed if two physicians say the mother's life is in danger), or if a mother was further along in her pregnancy than estimated.No third trimester abortions were performed in Florida in 2012 (Florida defines the third trimester as after 24 weeks of pregnancy).
 So far, none have been performed in 2013, according to the state Agency for Health Care Administration.
 More than 90 percent of the recorded 9,228 abortions performed statewide so far this year occurred during the first 12 weeks, according to the state.

Cary Pigman, R-Avon Park.

 But the practice became increasingly popular, largely out of convenience to mother and doctor.
 While not considered premature, babies born in this time frame may not be fully developed.
 Called \"early term,\" they face greater risks of many problems, including cerebral palsy and learning disabilities.
 In a typical month, it admitted 11 early term babies — who looked fine at delivery — for feeding or breathing problems, or unstable body temperatures.
 California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas together account for almost 40 percent of U.S.
 Joseph's, which runs the busiest maternity unit in Tampa Bay and the second-busiest in the state, joined the national study and rolled out strict new policies.
 It's not about when your mother or mother-in-law will be coming down,\" said Karen Howell, director of patient care services at St. Joseph's Women's.
 The March of Dimes provided a list of recommended practices, including a form for doctors to fill out noting a valid medical reason for an early delivery, such as a mother who has developed out-of-control hypertension.
 At St. Joseph's, most obstetricians are in private practice, not hospital employees.
 Joseph's elective early delivery rate has since declined to less than one percent.
 The six hospitals in Florida were even higher — beginning at 38 percent, said Sappenfield, a co-chair of the March of Dimes prematurity initiative.
 That decline was particularly gratifying, he said, since overall, high c-section rates in the U.S. are worrisome to experts.
 In Florida, 4,300 of the 213,000 babies born in 2011 may have been delivered too early unnecessarily, Sappenfield noted.
 There are common flowers and plants that can be unsafe or even fatal for dogs.
 Some plants to avoid are calla lilies, sago palm, azalea and rhododendron, among others.
 Be mindful of flowers and plants, such as roses, that have thorns.
 Do not use pesticides with snail bait with metaldehyde and fly bait with methomyl.
 Follow directions and be sure that pesticides are stored in a place where your dog cannot get to them.
