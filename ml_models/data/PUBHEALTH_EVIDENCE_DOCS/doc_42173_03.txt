 A veterans group (Veterans on Patrol) stumbled across the site while searching homeless camps in search of veterans who may need their help.
 They were shocked by what they found and they immediately contacted Craig Sawyer of Veterans For Child Rescue, who came right away.
 What sets this apart from the average homeless settlement- if such a thing exists- is that a plethora of items that indicate that the preponderance of the inhabitants were in fact children, including toys, clothing, breakfast cereals such as Lucky Charms, usually eaten by children.
 Concealed under brush was a septic tank turned on its side with an opening too small to admit adults.
 Because of the height of the aperture it would have been impossible for a child to get out without assistance.
 There was also what appeared to be a "rape tree" with straps made of strips of fire hose and nylon about 4 feet off the ground that appeared to be restraints.
