 ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04342728    Recruitment Status :       Enrolling by invitation              First Posted : April 13, 2020  Last Update Posted : August 14, 2020       Sponsor:  The Cleveland Clinic  Information provided by (Responsible Party): Milind Desai, The Cleveland Clinic     Study Details   Tabular View No Results Posted Disclaimer How to Read a Study Record         Study Description   Go to      Top of Page Study Description Study Design  Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information     Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of ascorbic acid (vitamin c) and zinc gluconate in reducing duration of symptoms in patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
 Patients above the age of 18 who present to the Cleveland Clinic outpatient testing and receive a positive test for COVID-19 will be invited to participate.
 Condition or disease   Intervention/treatment   Phase     COVID Corona Virus Infection   Dietary Supplement: Ascorbic Acid Dietary Supplement: Zinc Gluconate Dietary Supplement: Ascorbic Acid and Zinc Gluconate Other: Standard of Care   Not Applicable        Detailed Description: We aim to see whether ascorbic acid and zinc gluconate which has limited side effect profile and is readily available over the counter can decrease the duration of symptoms seen in patients with new diagnosis of COVID-2019.
 A secondary purpose is to see whether Zinc and/or Ascorbic acid supplementation can prevent progression of the severe manifestations of the disease including development of dyspnea and acute respiratory distress syndrome which may require hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and or lead to death.
 This is a single-center, prospective, randomized study which plans to enroll 520 patients with a principal diagnosis of COVID-2019, managed in an outpatient setting, who presented after being sent by a healthcare provider to get tested and receive a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) -assay based confirmed diagnosis of the disease.
 All patients who agree to participate in the study will answer a baseline questionnaire about their symptoms at the time of inclusion.
 Patients will then be randomized to one of 4 study arms.
 Patients in arms A, B and C will take study supplements daily for 10 days.
 Patients will then track their symptoms daily from day 0 to day 28 answering 12 basic questions on illness severity.They will stop filling out their daily questions once they reach reach the end of the 28 day study period or at time of hospitalization; whichever comes first .
 Study team members will call patients at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 of the study period to assess need for hospitalization, ER visit, or additional medications prescribed by a healthcare provider, and any side effects from the supplements that the patient could have experienced.
