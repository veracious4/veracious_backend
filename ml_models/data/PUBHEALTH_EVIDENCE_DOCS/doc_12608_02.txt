 Overdose WavesTrends in Death RatesData AnalysisData SourcesResourcesNearly 450,000 people died from overdoses involving any opioid, including prescription and illicit opioids, from 1999-2018.1 This rise in opioid overdose deaths can be outlined in three distinct waves.
 The first wave began with increased prescribing of opioids in the 1990s, with overdose deaths involving prescription opioids (natural and semi-synthetic opioids and methadone) increasing since at least 1999.2 The second wave began in 2010, with rapid increases in overdose deaths involving heroin.3 The third wave began in 2013, with significant increases in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, particularly those involving illicitly manufactured fentanyl.4,5,6 The market for illicitly manufactured fentanyl continues to change, and it can be found in combination with heroin, counterfeit pills, and cocaine.7  Many opioid-involved overdose deaths also include other drugs.8,9  Download full-resolution versionimage icon Opioids were involved in nearly 47,000 deaths in 2018, which is nearly six times the number of opioid-involved overdose deaths in 1999.
 The rate of drug overdose deaths involving opioids remains high, and CDC continues to track opioid overdose deaths.
 The graph below shows rates of overdose deaths associated with three categories of opioids, as well as all opioids overall.
 Rates of deaths involving natural and semi-synthetic opioids and methadone are combined in one category called Commonly Prescribed Opioids.

 Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause of death codes X40-X44, X60-X64, X85, and Y10-Y14.
 The following multiple cause of death codes were used to identify specific drug types: T40.2 for natural and semi-synthetic opioid analgesics, T40.3 for methadone, T40.4 for synthetic opioid analgesics excluding methadone, T40.1 for heroin, and T40.0, T40.1, T40.2, T40.3, T40.4 or T40.6 for any opioid, and T40.2, T40.3 for prescription opioids.
 Approximately one-fifth of drug poisoning deaths lack information on the specific drugs involved.
 Some of these deaths may involve opioid analgesics or heroin.
 Age-adjusted death rates were calculated using the direct method and the 2000 standard population.

 How the CDC Injury Center Calculates Opioid Overdoses It is important to identify and classify which types of drugs are involved in an overdose, how often they are involved, and how that involvement changes over time.
 By understanding drug involvement, we can better identify appropriate prevention and response activities.
 Historically, the approach to analyzing overdose death data used National Vital Statistics System mortality data (NVSS-M), with the combined categories of natural, semi-synthetic, and synthetic opioids (including methadone) used to report on overdose deaths involving prescription opioids.
 In more recent years, the data have shown the increase in overdose deaths is being fueled by deaths involving synthetic opioids (other than methadone), likely illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF).
 This increase in deaths has been associated with increases in drug submissions (i.e., drug products tested by forensic labs) of IMF, but not in pharmaceutical fentanyl prescribing rates.
 4,10,11,12  Thus, a large proportion of the increase in overdose deaths is presumably due to IMF and not prescription opioids.13 However, current information reported about overdose deaths in NVSS does not distinguish pharmaceutical fentanyl from IMF.
 Given the surge in availability of IMF starting in 2013, the CDC Injury Center began analyzing synthetic opioids (other than methadone) separately from other prescription opioids for 2014 mortality data.
 This analysis provides a more detailed understanding of the increase in different categories of opioid deaths.
 Using this approach, there were nearly 15,000 deaths involving this (more specific) category of prescription opioids in 2018, equivalent to about 41 deaths per day.12 This number is likely an undercount of deaths related to prescription opioids because it does not include deaths associated with pharmaceutical fentanyl, tramadol, and other synthetic opioids that are used as pain medications.
 Drug overdose deaths can be hard to categorize.
 In 8% of drug overdose deaths in 2018, no specific drug was listed on the death certificate.12 In many deaths, multiple drugs are present, and it is difficult to identify which drug or drugs caused the death (for example, heroin or a prescription opioid, when both are present).3 Regardless of the method used to calculate the total numbers, prescription opioids continue to be involved in a significant proportion of drug overdose deaths, and the numbers are likely an underestimate of the true burden, given the large proportion of overdose deaths where the type of drug is not listed on the death certificate.
 CDC’s National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) BioSense Platform is used by health officials to analyze and exchange syndromic data—improving awareness of health threats over time and across regional boundaries.
 The platform was developed through collaboration among CDC and other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other public health partners.
 The data are used to protect America’s health, safety, and security by improving nationwide situational awareness and enhancing responsiveness to hazardous events and disease outbreaks.
 Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance (ESOOS) funded states are able to provide more timely and comprehensive data on fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and risk factors associated with fatal overdoses, and also includes some reporting through CDC’s National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP).
 CDC’s State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) captures detailed information on toxicology, death scene investigations, route of administration, and other risk factors that may be associated with a fatal overdose, whether they are unintentional or undetermined.
 Data are collected through funded Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance (ESOOS) recipients.
 CDC’s Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) is a menu-driven system that makes nearly 20 collections of data available to public health professionals and the public at large.
 It provides access to a wide array of public health information, including births, deaths, diagnoses, vaccinations, environmental exposures, and population estimates.
 These data collections are available as online databases, which provide public access to ad hoc queries, summary statistics, maps, charts, and data extracts.
